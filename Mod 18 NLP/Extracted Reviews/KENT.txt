  Would have given zero rating if it was possible, i have been a kent customer for years and over the years kents service and product has come down to a such low that its useless, feel cheated after buying this product, my advice do not go for kent products and check for alternatives,The installation is supposedly free, but the service engineer will always push for a pre-filter, this was usual and i have experienced this before so i was ok with it, but now these guys have come up with a new concept of pressure reducing valve and says this avoids the purifier from bursting in case of high pressure and also avoids air getting in, now both of these components seems reasonable and cannot be avoided then why is this not provided by default with the purifier as these are part of safety.All this is not even start, the machine i recieved had wrong internal connection of water flow (not sure wether it was wrong or the installation guy had poor knowledge) so he had to correct it, this shocked me as a purifier which is factory assembled and passed their quality and testing check should not ideally have wrong connection.After all this circus the purifier have started leaking water even after the purifier was powered down, and now i have shut the water line to the purifier so that i can avoid flooding of my apartment, and have come to a realization the poor water taste i was facing was because the water was never getting purified and it was just passing through as is.Now this is a clear case of defective product but kent does not have any return or replacement they can only service and i have to hope that they would fix it.

  I Purchased this Product on July 9, 2020, at around 7 pm and it was delivered on July 12, 2020, around 2 pm. I requested for the Installation as soon as receiving the Product and the Service Guy came within an Hour after calling me for the address info. The purifier was Installed on the same day even though 12th July being a Sunday. I would urge others to request for the Installation and not wait for the Brand to call back as it may take time as they offer service according to the Queue. Also, Speed of Installation or Service may take time as per the Service Provider Availability. In my case, the Installation Work was given to their Authorised Service Centre in my area. The Service Guy himself did everything on his own and the Overall Experience was Satisfactory. He asked me for the Prefilter on the call before coming and told me the price to be 700 ( which may vary with Service Provider) which I agreed. After the installation, he said he changed the Inline Sediment Filter as it was defective but being in warranty it won't cost me a buck. He also asked me for my preferred TDS Level and he suggested to set it at 80. One thing to note is that the TDS level can only be set by the Service Guy with the help of a screw and there's no knob or button available to the end-user. Another thing he told me is that the Warranty for the Sediment and Carbon Filters is 6 months and for other filters and Parts is 1 year, In that period, the Respective Parts will be changed free of cost by the Service Guy himself. After the One Year, Only Service will be Free (Visiting and Maintenance Charges) but the Filters or any other parts have to bear by the Consumer (500-1000 for filters and 2500 for water pump). He also suggested changing the Prefilter every 3 months which will cost around 100-200. For other filters, it may vary according to the Water Consumption and the Water Quality of the Source. Although filters should be changed at least once a year. One Important thing to note before buying this particular product which I completely missed is that Kent New Grand doesn't come with a UV lamp inside Storage Tank, whereas it is present in the Newer Model Kent New Grand Plus. I would highly recommend going for that Model as it is only 1000 rupees (at max) more than this one but the extra UV lamp does ensure there are no bacterias present in the Storage Tank itself after all the Purification has been done ( It comes with a 9L tank as compared to 8L). It has all the same features as this one with that extra feature. As for the UV Lamp, it is not mentioned anywhere on Kent's Website or User Manual but by the looks of it, it does feel like a Stainless Steel Chamber (Do ask the Installation Guy or the Customer Service for the same). This was my Overall Experience for now and I opted than any other brand only because of that 3 years Extended AMC they are offering as opposed to their rivals. Thank You.

  The package was opened by KENT service person and he found that UF Membrane cartridge is broken and bypassed the connection.  Also he discouraged online purchase.  Instead of returning, he suggested to lodge a request via KENT Service App.  But it displays that my phone number is not updated.  At the same time it dispalys my  mobile number and address.  If the company do not replace the item, I have to return the unit for replacement

  Packaging was good.Water tastes good.Better than the previous version in terms of design.Installation was done in a timely manner.Storage indicator available but has no light.Required to buy the extra side filter and the cover for the Kent filter.Power consumption is less and purified water is 1 ltr for 2 ltr tap water.

  I recommend don't buy........1 - fake 1 year warranty and 3 year service free .After installation make abnormal sound and highly vibration in Kent RO inner parts ,After many times requested to customer Care no help and no response. Only say \"aapki Puri Shayta ki jayegi ,\"I requested to kent from Kent service app and also from customer Care number but after more then 15 days no service provided .2- price very very high ( same features) then other company and no quality and worst customer Care.3- Kent no free installation, if you call for installation then service person say you must buy prefilter from us and gives price 950 rupye extra. My prefilter buy from Amazon with KENR RO because prefilter recommendation by amazon, service person say you pay 300 rupye extra for your prefilter instaillation and no warranty provide KENT, if you Installation your prefilter ( I call customer care but no more help from Kent service center).4- don't go in brand name and high price because not always right,  brand name and high price.

  The installation request was raised on 16th Dec., however, no one has come to install it, that too even after calling customer care of kent 2-3 times. They assign the installation to one technician, who first told that he can come only between 10:30 AM to 1 PM, which did not match with my office hours, so i requested him to come earlier or in the evening, he didnt agree. I again contacted Kent customer care on Saturday (21 dec.) and requested them to schedule installation at the earliest, they scheduled installation at 3:30 PM same day, however, assigned the installation to the very same person who had been assigned earlier, and as usual he never came. I contacted kent customer care again on Sunday, however, of no use. It has become so difficult to get it installed, had i known it i would have never bought it

  Not filtering properly. Filtered water is containing white thread like particles. No support from customer care side. They are not replacing the faulty parts. Service center technician and owner and Kent Area sales manager all have seen the problem by home visit telling lie to the kent and denying to replace the part . They want me to do Lab test report for the water to get the part replaced.Very BAD SUPPORT from KENT. They don't want to replace the part becoz it is under warranty.NEVER BUY ANYTHING FROM KENT. THEY WILL NOT CHANGE THE PART BECAUSE IT IS UNDER WARRANTY. they will change the parts only when u give them money.

  I used this product from yesterday, so not to put any comments regarding the quality. Delivered on time by ATS, thanks for Amazon but I faced issues whenever I installed the product. After two days later technician came & tell me for purchasing Prefilter (Sediment Filter) which cost is  1650/ & also tell me if I not purchased the Pre-filter he back without installing the product. So I contact the Kent customer service & tell all the issues. After called the helpline I knew the actual price of Prefilter..700/. Nothing happens after lots of conference calld between Kent executive, local dealer & me. Me & my family members was frastete from the brand KENT. As per telephonic discussion with help line they arranged a senior manager call within two hours but write now I am not received any call from KENT HELP LINE CENTRE. Later I feel...this all  things out of my control so I paid 1650 & installed the product. My Local Dealer Name & contact details - GOUTAM PYNE, BANKURA, 8250950073, PIN- 722101, West Bengal.

I would highly recommend going for that Model as it is only 1000 rupees (at max) more than this one but the extra UV lamp does ensure there are no bacterias present in the Storage Tank itself after all the Purification has been done ( It comes with a 9L tank as compared to 8L). It has all the same features as this one with that extra feature. As for the UV Lamp, it is not mentioned anywhere on Kent's Website or User Manual but by the looks of it, it does feel like a Stainless Steel Chamber (Do ask the Installation Guy or the Customer Service for the same). This was my Overall Experience for now and I opted than any other brand only because of that 3 years Extended AMC they are offering as opposed to their rivals. Thank You.

  The package was opened by KENT service person and he found that UF Membrane cartridge is broken and bypassed the connection.  Also he discouraged online purchase.  Instead of returning, he suggested to lodge a request via KENT Service App.  But it displays that my phone number is not updated.  At the same time it dispalys my  mobile number and address.  If the company do not replace the item, I have to return the unit for replacement

  Packaging was good.Water tastes good.Better than the previous version in terms of design.Installation was done in a timely manner.Storage indicator available but has no light.Required to buy the extra side filter and the cover for the Kent filter.Power consumption is less and purified water is 1 ltr for 2 ltr tap water.

  I recommend don't buy........1 - fake 1 year warranty and 3 year service free .After installation make abnormal sound and highly vibration in Kent RO inner parts ,After many times requested to customer Care no help and no response. Only say \"aapki Puri Shayta ki jayegi ,\"I requested to kent from Kent service app and also from customer Care number but after more then 15 days no service provided .2- price very very high ( same features) then other company and no quality and worst customer Care.3- Kent no free installation, if you call for installation then service person say you must buy prefilter from us and gives price 950 rupye extra. My prefilter buy from Amazon with KENR RO because prefilter recommendation by amazon, service person say you pay 300 rupye extra for your prefilter instaillation and no warranty provide KENT, if you Installation your prefilter ( I call customer care but no more help from Kent service center).4- don't go in brand name and high price because not always right,  brand name and high price.

  The installation request was raised on 16th Dec., however, no one has come to install it, that too even after calling customer care of kent 2-3 times. They assign the installation to one technician, who first told that he can come only between 10:30 AM to 1 PM, which did not match with my office hours, so i requested him to come earlier or in the evening, he didnt agree. I again contacted Kent customer care on Saturday (21 dec.) and requested them to schedule installation at the earliest, they scheduled installation at 3:30 PM same day, however, assigned the installation to the very same person who had been assigned earlier, and as usual he never came. I contacted kent customer care again on Sunday, however, of no use. It has become so difficult to get it installed, had i known it i would have never bought it

  Not filtering properly. Filtered water is containing white thread like particles. No support from customer care side. They are not replacing the faulty parts. Service center technician and owner and Kent Area sales manager all have seen the problem by home visit telling lie to the kent and denying to replace the part . They want me to do Lab test report for the water to get the part replaced.Very BAD SUPPORT from KENT. They don't want to replace the part becoz it is under warranty.NEVER BUY ANYTHING FROM KENT. THEY WILL NOT CHANGE THE PART BECAUSE IT IS UNDER WARRANTY. they will change the parts only when u give them money.

  I used this product from yesterday, so not to put any comments regarding the quality. Delivered on time by ATS, thanks for Amazon but I faced issues whenever I installed the product. After two days later technician came & tell me for purchasing Prefilter (Sediment Filter) which cost is  1650/ & also tell me if I not purchased the Pre-filter he back without installing the product. So I contact the Kent customer service & tell all the issues. After called the helpline I knew the actual price of Prefilter..700/. Nothing happens after lots of conference calld between Kent executive, local dealer & me. Me & my family members was frastete from the brand KENT. As per telephonic discussion with help line they arranged a senior manager call within two hours but write now I am not received any call from KENT HELP LINE CENTRE. Later I feel...this all  things out of my control so I paid 1650 & installed the product. My Local Dealer Name & contact details - GOUTAM PYNE, BANKURA, 8250950073, PIN- 722101, West Bengal.

  Would have given zero rating if it was possible, i have been a kent customer for years and over the years kents service and product has come down to a such low that its useless, feel cheated after buying this product, my advice do not go for kent products and check for alternatives,The installation is supposedly free, but the service engineer will always push for a pre-filter, this was usual and i have experienced this before so i was ok with it, but now these guys have come up with a new concept of pressure reducing valve and says this avoids the purifier from bursting in case of high pressure and also avoids air getting in, now both of these components seems reasonable and cannot be avoided then why is this not provided by default with the purifier as these are part of safety.All this is not even start, the machine i recieved had wrong internal connection of water flow (not sure wether it was wrong or the installation guy had poor knowledge) so he had to correct it, this shocked me as a purifier which is factory assembled and passed their quality and testing check should not ideally have wrong connection.After all this circus the purifier have started leaking water even after the purifier was powered down, and now i have shut the water line to the purifier so that i can avoid flooding of my apartment, and have come to a realization the poor water taste i was facing was because the water was never getting purified and it was just passing through as is.Now this is a clear case of defective product but kent does not have any return or replacement they can only service and i have to hope that they would fix it.

  I Purchased this Product on July 9, 2020, at around 7 pm and it was delivered on July 12, 2020, around 2 pm. I requested for the Installation as soon as receiving the Product and the Service Guy came within an Hour after calling me for the address info. The purifier was Installed on the same day even though 12th July being a Sunday. I would urge others to request for the Installation and not wait for the Brand to call back as it may take time as they offer service according to the Queue. Also, Speed of Installation or Service may take time as per the Service Provider Availability. In my case, the Installation Work was given to their Authorised Service Centre in my area. The Service Guy himself did everything on his own and the Overall Experience was Satisfactory. He asked me for the Prefilter on the call before coming and told me the price to be 700 ( which may vary with Service Provider) which I agreed. After the installation, he said he changed the Inline Sediment Filter as it was defective but being in warranty it won't cost me a buck. He also asked me for my preferred TDS Level and he suggested to set it at 80. One thing to note is that the TDS level can only be set by the Service Guy with the help of a screw and there's no knob or button available to the end-user. Another thing he told me is that the Warranty for the Sediment and Carbon Filters is 6 months and for other filters and Parts is 1 year, In that period, the Respective Parts will be changed free of cost by the Service Guy himself. After the One Year, Only Service will be Free (Visiting and Maintenance Charges) but the Filters or any other parts have to bear by the Consumer (500-1000 for filters and 2500 for water pump). He also suggested changing the Prefilter every 3 months which will cost around 100-200. For other filters, it may vary according to the Water Consumption and the Water Quality of the Source. Although filters should be changed at least once a year. One Important thing to note before buying this particular product which I completely missed is that Kent New Grand doesn't come with a UV lamp inside Storage Tank, whereas it is present in the Newer Model Kent New Grand Plus.

  The installation request was raised on 16th Dec., however, no one has come to install it, that too even after calling customer care of kent 2-3 times. They assign the installation to one technician, who first told that he can come only between 10:30 AM to 1 PM, which did not match with my office hours, so i requested him to come earlier or in the evening, he didnt agree. I again contacted Kent customer care on Saturday (21 dec.) and requested them to schedule installation at the earliest, they scheduled installation at 3:30 PM same day, however, assigned the installation to the very same person who had been assigned earlier, and as usual he never came. I contacted kent customer care again on Sunday, however, of no use. It has become so difficult to get it installed, had i known it i would have never bought it

  Not filtering properly. Filtered water is containing white thread like particles. No support from customer care side. They are not replacing the faulty parts. Service center technician and owner and Kent Area sales manager all have seen the problem by home visit telling lie to the kent and denying to replace the part . They want me to do Lab test report for the water to get the part replaced.Very BAD SUPPORT from KENT. They don't want to replace the part becoz it is under warranty.NEVER BUY ANYTHING FROM KENT. THEY WILL NOT CHANGE THE PART BECAUSE IT IS UNDER WARRANTY. they will change the parts only when u give them money.

  I used this product from yesterday, so not to put any comments regarding the quality. Delivered on time by ATS, thanks for Amazon but I faced issues whenever I installed the product. After two days later technician came & tell me for purchasing Prefilter (Sediment Filter) which cost is  1650/ & also tell me if I not purchased the Pre-filter he back without installing the product. So I contact the Kent customer service & tell all the issues. After called the helpline I knew the actual price of Prefilter..700/. Nothing happens after lots of conference calld between Kent executive, local dealer & me. Me & my family members was frastete from the brand KENT. As per telephonic discussion with help line they arranged a senior manager call within two hours but write now I am not received any call from KENT HELP LINE CENTRE. Later I feel...this all  things out of my control so I paid 1650 & installed the product. My Local Dealer Name & contact details - GOUTAM PYNE, BANKURA, 8250950073, PIN- 722101, West Bengal.

  Would have given zero rating if it was possible, i have been a kent customer for years and over the years kents service and product has come down to a such low that its useless, feel cheated after buying this product, my advice do not go for kent products and check for alternatives,The installation is supposedly free, but the service engineer will always push for a pre-filter, this was usual and i have experienced this before so i was ok with it, but now these guys have come up with a new concept of pressure reducing valve and says this avoids the purifier from bursting in case of high pressure and also avoids air getting in, now both of these components seems reasonable and cannot be avoided then why is this not provided by default with the purifier as these are part of safety.All this is not even start, the machine i recieved had wrong internal connection of water flow (not sure wether it was wrong or the installation guy had poor knowledge) so he had to correct it, this shocked me as a purifier which is factory assembled and passed their quality and testing check should not ideally have wrong connection.After all this circus the purifier have started leaking water even after the purifier was powered down, and now i have shut the water line to the purifier so that i can avoid flooding of my apartment, and have come to a realization the poor water taste i was facing was because the water was never getting purified and it was just passing through as is.Now this is a clear case of defective product but kent does not have any return or replacement they can only service and i have to hope that they would fix it.

  I Purchased this Product on July 9, 2020, at around 7 pm and it was delivered on July 12, 2020, around 2 pm. I requested for the Installation as soon as receiving the Product and the Service Guy came within an Hour after calling me for the address info. The purifier was Installed on the same day even though 12th July being a Sunday. I would urge others to request for the Installation and not wait for the Brand to call back as it may take time as they offer service according to the Queue. Also, Speed of Installation or Service may take time as per the Service Provider Availability. In my case, the Installation Work was given to their Authorised Service Centre in my area. The Service Guy himself did everything on his own and the Overall Experience was Satisfactory. He asked me for the Prefilter on the call before coming and told me the price to be 700 ( which may vary with Service Provider) which I agreed. After the installation, he said he changed the Inline Sediment Filter as it was defective but being in warranty it won't cost me a buck. He also asked me for my preferred TDS Level and he suggested to set it at 80. One thing to note is that the TDS level can only be set by the Service Guy with the help of a screw and there's no knob or button available to the end-user. Another thing he told me is that the Warranty for the Sediment and Carbon Filters is 6 months and for other filters and Parts is 1 year, In that period, the Respective Parts will be changed free of cost by the Service Guy himself. After the One Year, Only Service will be Free (Visiting and Maintenance Charges) but the Filters or any other parts have to bear by the Consumer (500-1000 for filters and 2500 for water pump). He also suggested changing the Prefilter every 3 months which will cost around 100-200. For other filters, it may vary according to the Water Consumption and the Water Quality of the Source. Although filters should be changed at least once a year. One Important thing to note before buying this particular product which I completely missed is that Kent New Grand doesn't come with a UV lamp inside Storage Tank, whereas it is present in the Newer Model Kent New Grand Plus. I would highly recommend going for that Model as it is only 1000 rupees (at max) more than this one but the extra UV lamp does ensure there are no bacterias present in the Storage Tank itself after all the Purification has been done ( It comes with a 9L tank as compared to 8L). It has all the same features as this one with that extra feature. As for the UV Lamp, it is not mentioned anywhere on Kent's Website or User Manual but by the looks of it, it does feel like a Stainless Steel Chamber (Do ask the Installation Guy or the Customer Service for the same). This was my Overall Experience for now and I opted than any other brand only because of that 3 years Extended AMC they are offering as opposed to their rivals. Thank You.

  The package was opened by KENT service person and he found that UF Membrane cartridge is broken and bypassed the connection.  Also he discouraged online purchase.  Instead of returning, he suggested to lodge a request via KENT Service App.  But it displays that my phone number is not updated.  At the same time it dispalys my  mobile number and address.  If the company do not replace the item, I have to return the unit for replacement

  Packaging was good.Water tastes good.Better than the previous version in terms of design.Installation was done in a timely manner.Storage indicator available but has no light.Required to buy the extra side filter and the cover for the Kent filter.Power consumption is less and purified water is 1 ltr for 2 ltr tap water.

  I recommend don't buy........1 - fake 1 year warranty and 3 year service free .After installation make abnormal sound and highly vibration in Kent RO inner parts ,After many times requested to customer Care no help and no response. Only say \"aapki Puri Shayta ki jayegi ,\"I requested to kent from Kent service app and also from customer Care number but after more then 15 days no service provided .2- price very very high ( same features) then other company and no quality and worst customer Care.3- Kent no free installation, if you call for installation then service person say you must buy prefilter from us and gives price 950 rupye extra. My prefilter buy from Amazon with KENR RO because prefilter recommendation by amazon, service person say you pay 300 rupye extra for your prefilter instaillation and no warranty provide KENT, if you Installation your prefilter ( I call customer care but no more help from Kent service center).4- don't go in brand name and high price because not always right,  brand name and high price.

  Would have given zero rating if it was possible, i have been a kent customer for years and over the years kents service and product has come down to a such low that its useless, feel cheated after buying this product, my advice do not go for kent products and check for alternatives,The installation is supposedly free, but the service engineer will always push for a pre-filter, this was usual and i have experienced this before so i was ok with it, but now these guys have come up with a new concept of pressure reducing valve and says this avoids the purifier from bursting in case of high pressure and also avoids air getting in, now both of these components seems reasonable and cannot be avoided then why is this not provided by default with the purifier as these are part of safety.All this is not even start, the machine i recieved had wrong internal connection of water flow (not sure wether it was wrong or the installation guy had poor knowledge) so he had to correct it, this shocked me as a purifier which is factory assembled and passed their quality and testing check should not ideally have wrong connection.After all this circus the purifier have started leaking water even after the purifier was powered down, and now i have shut the water line to the purifier so that i can avoid flooding of my apartment, and have come to a realization the poor water taste i was facing was because the water was never getting purified and it was just passing through as is.Now this is a clear case of defective product but kent does not have any return or replacement they can only service and i have to hope that they would fix it.

  I Purchased this Product on July 9, 2020, at around 7 pm and it was delivered on July 12, 2020, around 2 pm. I requested for the Installation as soon as receiving the Product and the Service Guy came within an Hour after calling me for the address info. The purifier was Installed on the same day even though 12th July being a Sunday. I would urge others to request for the Installation and not wait for the Brand to call back as it may take time as they offer service according to the Queue. Also, Speed of Installation or Service may take time as per the Service Provider Availability. In my case, the Installation Work was given to their Authorised Service Centre in my area. The Service Guy himself did everything on his own and the Overall Experience was Satisfactory. He asked me for the Prefilter on the call before coming and told me the price to be 700 ( which may vary with Service Provider) which I agreed. After the installation, he said he changed the Inline Sediment Filter as it was defective but being in warranty it won't cost me a buck. He also asked me for my preferred TDS Level and he suggested to set it at 80. One thing to note is that the TDS level can only be set by the Service Guy with the help of a screw and there's no knob or button available to the end-user. Another thing he told me is that the Warranty for the Sediment and Carbon Filters is 6 months and for other filters and Parts is 1 year, In that period, the Respective Parts will be changed free of cost by the Service Guy himself. After the One Year, Only Service will be Free (Visiting and Maintenance Charges) but the Filters or any other parts have to bear by the Consumer (500-1000 for filters and 2500 for water pump). He also suggested changing the Prefilter every 3 months which will cost around 100-200. For other filters, it may vary according to the Water Consumption and the Water Quality of the Source. Although filters should be changed at least once a year. One Important thing to note before buying this particular product which I completely missed is that Kent New Grand doesn't come with a UV lamp inside Storage Tank, whereas it is present in the Newer Model Kent New Grand Plus. I would highly recommend going for that Model as it is only 1000 rupees (at max) more than this one but the extra UV lamp does ensure there are no bacterias present in the Storage Tank itself after all the Purification has been done ( It comes with a 9L tank as compared to 8L). It has all the same features as this one with that extra feature. As for the UV Lamp, it is not mentioned anywhere on Kent's Website or User Manual but by the looks of it, it does feel like a Stainless Steel Chamber (Do ask the Installation Guy or the Customer Service for the same). This was my Overall Experience for now and I opted than any other brand only because of that 3 years Extended AMC they are offering as opposed to their rivals. Thank You.

  The package was opened by KENT service person and he found that UF Membrane cartridge is broken and bypassed the connection.  Also he discouraged online purchase.  Instead of returning, he suggested to lodge a request via KENT Service App.  But it displays that my phone number is not updated.  At the same time it dispalys my  mobile number and address.  If the company do not replace the item, I have to return the unit for replacement

  Packaging was good.Water tastes good.Better than the previous version in terms of design.Installation was done in a timely manner.Storage indicator available but has no light.Required to buy the extra side filter and the cover for the Kent filter.Power consumption is less and purified water is 1 ltr for 2 ltr tap water.

  I recommend don't buy........1 - fake 1 year warranty and 3 year service free .After installation make abnormal sound and highly vibration in Kent RO inner parts ,After many times requested to customer Care no help and no response. Only say \"aapki Puri Shayta ki jayegi ,\"I requested to kent from Kent service app and also from customer Care number but after more then 15 days no service provided .2- price very very high ( same features) then other company and no quality and worst customer Care.3- Kent no free installation, if you call for installation then service person say you must buy prefilter from us and gives price 950 rupye extra. My prefilter buy from Amazon with KENR RO because prefilter recommendation by amazon, service person say you pay 300 rupye extra for your prefilter instaillation and no warranty provide KENT, if you Installation your prefilter ( I call customer care but no more help from Kent service center).4- don't go in brand name and high price because not always right,  brand name and high price.

  The installation request was raised on 16th Dec., however, no one has come to install it, that too even after calling customer care of kent 2-3 times. They assign the installation to one technician, who first told that he can come only between 10:30 AM to 1 PM, which did not match with my office hours, so i requested him to come earlier or in the evening, he didnt agree. I again contacted Kent customer care on Saturday (21 dec.) and requested them to schedule installation at the earliest, they scheduled installation at 3:30 PM same day, however, assigned the installation to the very same person who had been assigned earlier, and as usual he never came. I contacted kent customer care again on Sunday, however, of no use. It has become so difficult to get it installed, had i known it i would have never bought it

  Not filtering properly. Filtered water is containing white thread like particles. No support from customer care side. They are not replacing the faulty parts. Service center technician and owner and Kent Area sales manager all have seen the problem by home visit telling lie to the kent and denying to replace the part . They want me to do Lab test report for the water to get the part replaced.Very BAD SUPPORT from KENT. They don't want to replace the part becoz it is under warranty.NEVER BUY ANYTHING FROM KENT. THEY WILL NOT CHANGE THE PART BECAUSE IT IS UNDER WARRANTY. they will change the parts only when u give them money.

  I used this product from yesterday, so not to put any comments regarding the quality. Delivered on time by ATS, thanks for Amazon but I faced issues whenever I installed the product. After two days later technician came & tell me for purchasing Prefilter (Sediment Filter) which cost is  1650/ & also tell me if I not purchased the Pre-filter he back without installing the product. So I contact the Kent customer service & tell all the issues. After called the helpline I knew the actual price of Prefilter..700/. Nothing happens after lots of conference calld between Kent executive, local dealer & me. Me & my family members was frastete from the brand KENT. As per telephonic discussion with help line they arranged a senior manager call within two hours but write now I am not received any call from KENT HELP LINE CENTRE. Later I feel...this all  things out of my control so I paid 1650 & installed the product. My Local Dealer Name & contact details - GOUTAM PYNE, BANKURA, 8250950073, PIN- 722101, West Bengal.

It has all the same features as this one with that extra feature. As for the UV Lamp, it is not mentioned anywhere on Kent's Website or User Manual but by the looks of it, it does feel like a Stainless Steel Chamber (Do ask the Installation Guy or the Customer Service for the same). This was my Overall Experience for now and I opted than any other brand only because of that 3 years Extended AMC they are offering as opposed to their rivals. Thank You.

  The package was opened by KENT service person and he found that UF Membrane cartridge is broken and bypassed the connection.  Also he discouraged online purchase.  Instead of returning, he suggested to lodge a request via KENT Service App.  But it displays that my phone number is not updated.  At the same time it dispalys my  mobile number and address.  If the company do not replace the item, I have to return the unit for replacement

  Packaging was good.Water tastes good.Better than the previous version in terms of design.Installation was done in a timely manner.Storage indicator available but has no light.Required to buy the extra side filter and the cover for the Kent filter.Power consumption is less and purified water is 1 ltr for 2 ltr tap water.

  I recommend don't buy........1 - fake 1 year warranty and 3 year service free .After installation make abnormal sound and highly vibration in Kent RO inner parts ,After many times requested to customer Care no help and no response. Only say \"aapki Puri Shayta ki jayegi ,\"I requested to kent from Kent service app and also from customer Care number but after more then 15 days no service provided .2- price very very high ( same features) then other company and no quality and worst customer Care.3- Kent no free installation, if you call for installation then service person say you must buy prefilter from us and gives price 950 rupye extra. My prefilter buy from Amazon with KENR RO because prefilter recommendation by amazon, service person say you pay 300 rupye extra for your prefilter instaillation and no warranty provide KENT, if you Installation your prefilter ( I call customer care but no more help from Kent service center).4- don't go in brand name and high price because not always right,  brand name and high price.

  The installation request was raised on 16th Dec., however, no one has come to install it, that too even after calling customer care of kent 2-3 times. They assign the installation to one technician, who first told that he can come only between 10:30 AM to 1 PM, which did not match with my office hours, so i requested him to come earlier or in the evening, he didnt agree. I again contacted Kent customer care on Saturday (21 dec.) and requested them to schedule installation at the earliest, they scheduled installation at 3:30 PM same day, however, assigned the installation to the very same person who had been assigned earlier, and as usual he never came. I contacted kent customer care again on Sunday, however, of no use. It has become so difficult to get it installed, had i known it i would have never bought it

  Not filtering properly. Filtered water is containing white thread like particles. No support from customer care side. They are not replacing the faulty parts. Service center technician and owner and Kent Area sales manager all have seen the problem by home visit telling lie to the kent and denying to replace the part . They want me to do Lab test report for the water to get the part replaced.Very BAD SUPPORT from KENT. They don't want to replace the part becoz it is under warranty.NEVER BUY ANYTHING FROM KENT. THEY WILL NOT CHANGE THE PART BECAUSE IT IS UNDER WARRANTY. they will change the parts only when u give them money.

  I used this product from yesterday, so not to put any comments regarding the quality. Delivered on time by ATS, thanks for Amazon but I faced issues whenever I installed the product. After two days later technician came & tell me for purchasing Prefilter (Sediment Filter) which cost is  1650/ & also tell me if I not purchased the Pre-filter he back without installing the product. So I contact the Kent customer service & tell all the issues. After called the helpline I knew the actual price of Prefilter..700/. Nothing happens after lots of conference calld between Kent executive, local dealer & me. Me & my family members was frastete from the brand KENT. As per telephonic discussion with help line they arranged a senior manager call within two hours but write now I am not received any call from KENT HELP LINE CENTRE. Later I feel...this all  things out of my control so I paid 1650 & installed the product. My Local Dealer Name & contact details - GOUTAM PYNE, BANKURA, 8250950073, PIN- 722101, West Bengal.

  Would have given zero rating if it was possible, i have been a kent customer for years and over the years kents service and product has come down to a such low that its useless, feel cheated after buying this product, my advice do not go for kent products and check for alternatives,The installation is supposedly free, but the service engineer will always push for a pre-filter, this was usual and i have experienced this before so i was ok with it, but now these guys have come up with a new concept of pressure reducing valve and says this avoids the purifier from bursting in case of high pressure and also avoids air getting in, now both of these components seems reasonable and cannot be avoided then why is this not provided by default with the purifier as these are part of safety.All this is not even start, the machine i recieved had wrong internal connection of water flow (not sure wether it was wrong or the installation guy had poor knowledge) so he had to correct it, this shocked me as a purifier which is factory assembled and passed their quality and testing check should not ideally have wrong connection.After all this circus the purifier have started leaking water even after the purifier was powered down, and now i have shut the water line to the purifier so that i can avoid flooding of my apartment, and have come to a realization the poor water taste i was facing was because the water was never getting purified and it was just passing through as is.Now this is a clear case of defective product but kent does not have any return or replacement they can only service and i have to hope that they would fix it.

  I Purchased this Product on July 9, 2020, at around 7 pm and it was delivered on July 12, 2020, around 2 pm. I requested for the Installation as soon as receiving the Product and the Service Guy came within an Hour after calling me for the address info. The purifier was Installed on the same day even though 12th July being a Sunday. I would urge others to request for the Installation and not wait for the Brand to call back as it may take time as they offer service according to the Queue. Also, Speed of Installation or Service may take time as per the Service Provider Availability. In my case, the Installation Work was given to their Authorised Service Centre in my area. The Service Guy himself did everything on his own and the Overall Experience was Satisfactory. He asked me for the Prefilter on the call before coming and told me the price to be 700 ( which may vary with Service Provider) which I agreed. After the installation, he said he changed the Inline Sediment Filter as it was defective but being in warranty it won't cost me a buck. He also asked me for my preferred TDS Level and he suggested to set it at 80. One thing to note is that the TDS level can only be set by the Service Guy with the help of a screw and there's no knob or button available to the end-user. Another thing he told me is that the Warranty for the Sediment and Carbon Filters is 6 months and for other filters and Parts is 1 year, In that period, the Respective Parts will be changed free of cost by the Service Guy himself. After the One Year, Only Service will be Free (Visiting and Maintenance Charges) but the Filters or any other parts have to bear by the Consumer (500-1000 for filters and 2500 for water pump). He also suggested changing the Prefilter every 3 months which will cost around 100-200. For other filters, it may vary according to the Water Consumption and the Water Quality of the Source. Although filters should be changed at least once a year. One Important thing to note before buying this particular product which I completely missed is that Kent New Grand doesn't come with a UV lamp inside Storage Tank, whereas it is present in the Newer Model Kent New Grand Plus. I would highly recommend going for that Model as it is only 1000 rupees (at max) more than this one but the extra UV lamp does ensure there are no bacterias present in the Storage Tank itself after all the Purification has been done ( It comes with a 9L tank as compared to 8L).

  The installation request was raised on 16th Dec., however, no one has come to install it, that too even after calling customer care of kent 2-3 times. They assign the installation to one technician, who first told that he can come only between 10:30 AM to 1 PM, which did not match with my office hours, so i requested him to come earlier or in the evening, he didnt agree. I again contacted Kent customer care on Saturday (21 dec.) and requested them to schedule installation at the earliest, they scheduled installation at 3:30 PM same day, however, assigned the installation to the very same person who had been assigned earlier, and as usual he never came. I contacted kent customer care again on Sunday, however, of no use. It has become so difficult to get it installed, had i known it i would have never bought it

  Not filtering properly. Filtered water is containing white thread like particles. No support from customer care side. They are not replacing the faulty parts. Service center technician and owner and Kent Area sales manager all have seen the problem by home visit telling lie to the kent and denying to replace the part . They want me to do Lab test report for the water to get the part replaced.Very BAD SUPPORT from KENT. They don't want to replace the part becoz it is under warranty.NEVER BUY ANYTHING FROM KENT. THEY WILL NOT CHANGE THE PART BECAUSE IT IS UNDER WARRANTY. they will change the parts only when u give them money.

  I used this product from yesterday, so not to put any comments regarding the quality. Delivered on time by ATS, thanks for Amazon but I faced issues whenever I installed the product. After two days later technician came & tell me for purchasing Prefilter (Sediment Filter) which cost is  1650/ & also tell me if I not purchased the Pre-filter he back without installing the product. So I contact the Kent customer service & tell all the issues. After called the helpline I knew the actual price of Prefilter..700/. Nothing happens after lots of conference calld between Kent executive, local dealer & me. Me & my family members was frastete from the brand KENT. As per telephonic discussion with help line they arranged a senior manager call within two hours but write now I am not received any call from KENT HELP LINE CENTRE. Later I feel...this all  things out of my control so I paid 1650 & installed the product. My Local Dealer Name & contact details - GOUTAM PYNE, BANKURA, 8250950073, PIN- 722101, West Bengal.

  Would have given zero rating if it was possible, i have been a kent customer for years and over the years kents service and product has come down to a such low that its useless, feel cheated after buying this product, my advice do not go for kent products and check for alternatives,The installation is supposedly free, but the service engineer will always push for a pre-filter, this was usual and i have experienced this before so i was ok with it, but now these guys have come up with a new concept of pressure reducing valve and says this avoids the purifier from bursting in case of high pressure and also avoids air getting in, now both of these components seems reasonable and cannot be avoided then why is this not provided by default with the purifier as these are part of safety.All this is not even start, the machine i recieved had wrong internal connection of water flow (not sure wether it was wrong or the installation guy had poor knowledge) so he had to correct it, this shocked me as a purifier which is factory assembled and passed their quality and testing check should not ideally have wrong connection.After all this circus the purifier have started leaking water even after the purifier was powered down, and now i have shut the water line to the purifier so that i can avoid flooding of my apartment, and have come to a realization the poor water taste i was facing was because the water was never getting purified and it was just passing through as is.Now this is a clear case of defective product but kent does not have any return or replacement they can only service and i have to hope that they would fix it.

  I Purchased this Product on July 9, 2020, at around 7 pm and it was delivered on July 12, 2020, around 2 pm. I requested for the Installation as soon as receiving the Product and the Service Guy came within an Hour after calling me for the address info. The purifier was Installed on the same day even though 12th July being a Sunday. I would urge others to request for the Installation and not wait for the Brand to call back as it may take time as they offer service according to the Queue. Also, Speed of Installation or Service may take time as per the Service Provider Availability. In my case, the Installation Work was given to their Authorised Service Centre in my area. The Service Guy himself did everything on his own and the Overall Experience was Satisfactory. He asked me for the Prefilter on the call before coming and told me the price to be 700 ( which may vary with Service Provider) which I agreed. After the installation, he said he changed the Inline Sediment Filter as it was defective but being in warranty it won't cost me a buck. He also asked me for my preferred TDS Level and he suggested to set it at 80. One thing to note is that the TDS level can only be set by the Service Guy with the help of a screw and there's no knob or button available to the end-user. Another thing he told me is that the Warranty for the Sediment and Carbon Filters is 6 months and for other filters and Parts is 1 year, In that period, the Respective Parts will be changed free of cost by the Service Guy himself. After the One Year, Only Service will be Free (Visiting and Maintenance Charges) but the Filters or any other parts have to bear by the Consumer (500-1000 for filters and 2500 for water pump). He also suggested changing the Prefilter every 3 months which will cost around 100-200. For other filters, it may vary according to the Water Consumption and the Water Quality of the Source. Although filters should be changed at least once a year. One Important thing to note before buying this particular product which I completely missed is that Kent New Grand doesn't come with a UV lamp inside Storage Tank, whereas it is present in the Newer Model Kent New Grand Plus. I would highly recommend going for that Model as it is only 1000 rupees (at max) more than this one but the extra UV lamp does ensure there are no bacterias present in the Storage Tank itself after all the Purification has been done ( It comes with a 9L tank as compared to 8L). It has all the same features as this one with that extra feature. As for the UV Lamp, it is not mentioned anywhere on Kent's Website or User Manual but by the looks of it, it does feel like a Stainless Steel Chamber (Do ask the Installation Guy or the Customer Service for the same). This was my Overall Experience for now and I opted than any other brand only because of that 3 years Extended AMC they are offering as opposed to their rivals. Thank You.

  The package was opened by KENT service person and he found that UF Membrane cartridge is broken and bypassed the connection.  Also he discouraged online purchase.  Instead of returning, he suggested to lodge a request via KENT Service App.  But it displays that my phone number is not updated.  At the same time it dispalys my  mobile number and address.  If the company do not replace the item, I have to return the unit for replacement

  Packaging was good.Water tastes good.Better than the previous version in terms of design.Installation was done in a timely manner.Storage indicator available but has no light.Required to buy the extra side filter and the cover for the Kent filter.Power consumption is less and purified water is 1 ltr for 2 ltr tap water.

  I recommend don't buy........1 - fake 1 year warranty and 3 year service free .After installation make abnormal sound and highly vibration in Kent RO inner parts ,After many times requested to customer Care no help and no response. Only say \"aapki Puri Shayta ki jayegi ,\"I requested to kent from Kent service app and also from customer Care number but after more then 15 days no service provided .2- price very very high ( same features) then other company and no quality and worst customer Care.3- Kent no free installation, if you call for installation then service person say you must buy prefilter from us and gives price 950 rupye extra. My prefilter buy from Amazon with KENR RO because prefilter recommendation by amazon, service person say you pay 300 rupye extra for your prefilter instaillation and no warranty provide KENT, if you Installation your prefilter ( I call customer care but no more help from Kent service center).4- don't go in brand name and high price because not always right,  brand name and high price.

  Would have given zero rating if it was possible, i have been a kent customer for years and over the years kents service and product has come down to a such low that its useless, feel cheated after buying this product, my advice do not go for kent products and check for alternatives,The installation is supposedly free, but the service engineer will always push for a pre-filter, this was usual and i have experienced this before so i was ok with it, but now these guys have come up with a new concept of pressure reducing valve and says this avoids the purifier from bursting in case of high pressure and also avoids air getting in, now both of these components seems reasonable and cannot be avoided then why is this not provided by default with the purifier as these are part of safety.All this is not even start, the machine i recieved had wrong internal connection of water flow (not sure wether it was wrong or the installation guy had poor knowledge) so he had to correct it, this shocked me as a purifier which is factory assembled and passed their quality and testing check should not ideally have wrong connection.After all this circus the purifier have started leaking water even after the purifier was powered down, and now i have shut the water line to the purifier so that i can avoid flooding of my apartment, and have come to a realization the poor water taste i was facing was because the water was never getting purified and it was just passing through as is.Now this is a clear case of defective product but kent does not have any return or replacement they can only service and i have to hope that they would fix it.

  I Purchased this Product on July 9, 2020, at around 7 pm and it was delivered on July 12, 2020, around 2 pm. I requested for the Installation as soon as receiving the Product and the Service Guy came within an Hour after calling me for the address info. The purifier was Installed on the same day even though 12th July being a Sunday. I would urge others to request for the Installation and not wait for the Brand to call back as it may take time as they offer service according to the Queue. Also, Speed of Installation or Service may take time as per the Service Provider Availability. In my case, the Installation Work was given to their Authorised Service Centre in my area. The Service Guy himself did everything on his own and the Overall Experience was Satisfactory. He asked me for the Prefilter on the call before coming and told me the price to be 700 ( which may vary with Service Provider) which I agreed. After the installation, he said he changed the Inline Sediment Filter as it was defective but being in warranty it won't cost me a buck. He also asked me for my preferred TDS Level and he suggested to set it at 80. One thing to note is that the TDS level can only be set by the Service Guy with the help of a screw and there's no knob or button available to the end-user. Another thing he told me is that the Warranty for the Sediment and Carbon Filters is 6 months and for other filters and Parts is 1 year, In that period, the Respective Parts will be changed free of cost by the Service Guy himself. After the One Year, Only Service will be Free (Visiting and Maintenance Charges) but the Filters or any other parts have to bear by the Consumer (500-1000 for filters and 2500 for water pump). He also suggested changing the Prefilter every 3 months which will cost around 100-200. For other filters, it may vary according to the Water Consumption and the Water Quality of the Source. Although filters should be changed at least once a year. One Important thing to note before buying this particular product which I completely missed is that Kent New Grand doesn't come with a UV lamp inside Storage Tank, whereas it is present in the Newer Model Kent New Grand Plus. I would highly recommend going for that Model as it is only 1000 rupees (at max) more than this one but the extra UV lamp does ensure there are no bacterias present in the Storage Tank itself after all the Purification has been done ( It comes with a 9L tank as compared to 8L). It has all the same features as this one with that extra feature. As for the UV Lamp, it is not mentioned anywhere on Kent's Website or User Manual but by the looks of it, it does feel like a Stainless Steel Chamber (Do ask the Installation Guy or the Customer Service for the same). This was my Overall Experience for now and I opted than any other brand only because of that 3 years Extended AMC they are offering as opposed to their rivals. Thank You.

  The package was opened by KENT service person and he found that UF Membrane cartridge is broken and bypassed the connection.  Also he discouraged online purchase.  Instead of returning, he suggested to lodge a request via KENT Service App.  But it displays that my phone number is not updated.  At the same time it dispalys my  mobile number and address.  If the company do not replace the item, I have to return the unit for replacement

  Packaging was good.Water tastes good.Better than the previous version in terms of design.Installation was done in a timely manner.Storage indicator available but has no light.Required to buy the extra side filter and the cover for the Kent filter.Power consumption is less and purified water is 1 ltr for 2 ltr tap water.

  I recommend don't buy........1 - fake 1 year warranty and 3 year service free .After installation make abnormal sound and highly vibration in Kent RO inner parts ,After many times requested to customer Care no help and no response. Only say \"aapki Puri Shayta ki jayegi ,\"I requested to kent from Kent service app and also from customer Care number but after more then 15 days no service provided .2- price very very high ( same features) then other company and no quality and worst customer Care.3- Kent no free installation, if you call for installation then service person say you must buy prefilter from us and gives price 950 rupye extra. My prefilter buy from Amazon with KENR RO because prefilter recommendation by amazon, service person say you pay 300 rupye extra for your prefilter instaillation and no warranty provide KENT, if you Installation your prefilter ( I call customer care but no more help from Kent service center).4- don't go in brand name and high price because not always right,  brand name and high price.

  The installation request was raised on 16th Dec., however, no one has come to install it, that too even after calling customer care of kent 2-3 times. They assign the installation to one technician, who first told that he can come only between 10:30 AM to 1 PM, which did not match with my office hours, so i requested him to come earlier or in the evening, he didnt agree. I again contacted Kent customer care on Saturday (21 dec.) and requested them to schedule installation at the earliest, they scheduled installation at 3:30 PM same day, however, assigned the installation to the very same person who had been assigned earlier, and as usual he never came. I contacted kent customer care again on Sunday, however, of no use. It has become so difficult to get it installed, had i known it i would have never bought it

  Not filtering properly. Filtered water is containing white thread like particles. No support from customer care side. They are not replacing the faulty parts. Service center technician and owner and Kent Area sales manager all have seen the problem by home visit telling lie to the kent and denying to replace the part . They want me to do Lab test report for the water to get the part replaced.Very BAD SUPPORT from KENT. They don't want to replace the part becoz it is under warranty.NEVER BUY ANYTHING FROM KENT. THEY WILL NOT CHANGE THE PART BECAUSE IT IS UNDER WARRANTY. they will change the parts only when u give them money.

  I used this product from yesterday, so not to put any comments regarding the quality. Delivered on time by ATS, thanks for Amazon but I faced issues whenever I installed the product. After two days later technician came & tell me for purchasing Prefilter (Sediment Filter) which cost is  1650/ & also tell me if I not purchased the Pre-filter he back without installing the product. So I contact the Kent customer service & tell all the issues. After called the helpline I knew the actual price of Prefilter..700/. Nothing happens after lots of conference calld between Kent executive, local dealer & me. Me & my family members was frastete from the brand KENT. As per telephonic discussion with help line they arranged a senior manager call within two hours but write now I am not received any call from KENT HELP LINE CENTRE. Later I feel...this all  things out of my control so I paid 1650 & installed the product. My Local Dealer Name & contact details - GOUTAM PYNE, BANKURA, 8250950073, PIN- 722101, West Bengal.

It has all the same features as this one with that extra feature. As for the UV Lamp, it is not mentioned anywhere on Kent's Website or User Manual but by the looks of it, it does feel like a Stainless Steel Chamber (Do ask the Installation Guy or the Customer Service for the same). This was my Overall Experience for now and I opted than any other brand only because of that 3 years Extended AMC they are offering as opposed to their rivals. Thank You.

  The package was opened by KENT service person and he found that UF Membrane cartridge is broken and bypassed the connection.  Also he discouraged online purchase.  Instead of returning, he suggested to lodge a request via KENT Service App.  But it displays that my phone number is not updated.  At the same time it dispalys my  mobile number and address.  If the company do not replace the item, I have to return the unit for replacement

  Packaging was good.Water tastes good.Better than the previous version in terms of design.Installation was done in a timely manner.Storage indicator available but has no light.Required to buy the extra side filter and the cover for the Kent filter.Power consumption is less and purified water is 1 ltr for 2 ltr tap water.

  I recommend don't buy........1 - fake 1 year warranty and 3 year service free .After installation make abnormal sound and highly vibration in Kent RO inner parts ,After many times requested to customer Care no help and no response. Only say \"aapki Puri Shayta ki jayegi ,\"I requested to kent from Kent service app and also from customer Care number but after more then 15 days no service provided .2- price very very high ( same features) then other company and no quality and worst customer Care.3- Kent no free installation, if you call for installation then service person say you must buy prefilter from us and gives price 950 rupye extra. My prefilter buy from Amazon with KENR RO because prefilter recommendation by amazon, service person say you pay 300 rupye extra for your prefilter instaillation and no warranty provide KENT, if you Installation your prefilter ( I call customer care but no more help from Kent service center).4- don't go in brand name and high price because not always right,  brand name and high price.

  The installation request was raised on 16th Dec., however, no one has come to install it, that too even after calling customer care of kent 2-3 times. They assign the installation to one technician, who first told that he can come only between 10:30 AM to 1 PM, which did not match with my office hours, so i requested him to come earlier or in the evening, he didnt agree. I again contacted Kent customer care on Saturday (21 dec.) and requested them to schedule installation at the earliest, they scheduled installation at 3:30 PM same day, however, assigned the installation to the very same person who had been assigned earlier, and as usual he never came. I contacted kent customer care again on Sunday, however, of no use. It has become so difficult to get it installed, had i known it i would have never bought it

  Not filtering properly. Filtered water is containing white thread like particles. No support from customer care side. They are not replacing the faulty parts. Service center technician and owner and Kent Area sales manager all have seen the problem by home visit telling lie to the kent and denying to replace the part . They want me to do Lab test report for the water to get the part replaced.Very BAD SUPPORT from KENT. They don't want to replace the part becoz it is under warranty.NEVER BUY ANYTHING FROM KENT. THEY WILL NOT CHANGE THE PART BECAUSE IT IS UNDER WARRANTY. they will change the parts only when u give them money.

  I used this product from yesterday, so not to put any comments regarding the quality. Delivered on time by ATS, thanks for Amazon but I faced issues whenever I installed the product. After two days later technician came & tell me for purchasing Prefilter (Sediment Filter) which cost is  1650/ & also tell me if I not purchased the Pre-filter he back without installing the product. So I contact the Kent customer service & tell all the issues. After called the helpline I knew the actual price of Prefilter..700/. Nothing happens after lots of conference calld between Kent executive, local dealer & me. Me & my family members was frastete from the brand KENT. As per telephonic discussion with help line they arranged a senior manager call within two hours but write now I am not received any call from KENT HELP LINE CENTRE. Later I feel...this all  things out of my control so I paid 1650 & installed the product. My Local Dealer Name & contact details - GOUTAM PYNE, BANKURA, 8250950073, PIN- 722101, West Bengal.

  Would have given zero rating if it was possible, i have been a kent customer for years and over the years kents service and product has come down to a such low that its useless, feel cheated after buying this product, my advice do not go for kent products and check for alternatives,The installation is supposedly free, but the service engineer will always push for a pre-filter, this was usual and i have experienced this before so i was ok with it, but now these guys have come up with a new concept of pressure reducing valve and says this avoids the purifier from bursting in case of high pressure and also avoids air getting in, now both of these components seems reasonable and cannot be avoided then why is this not provided by default with the purifier as these are part of safety.All this is not even start, the machine i recieved had wrong internal connection of water flow (not sure wether it was wrong or the installation guy had poor knowledge) so he had to correct it, this shocked me as a purifier which is factory assembled and passed their quality and testing check should not ideally have wrong connection.After all this circus the purifier have started leaking water even after the purifier was powered down, and now i have shut the water line to the purifier so that i can avoid flooding of my apartment, and have come to a realization the poor water taste i was facing was because the water was never getting purified and it was just passing through as is.Now this is a clear case of defective product but kent does not have any return or replacement they can only service and i have to hope that they would fix it.

  I Purchased this Product on July 9, 2020, at around 7 pm and it was delivered on July 12, 2020, around 2 pm. I requested for the Installation as soon as receiving the Product and the Service Guy came within an Hour after calling me for the address info. The purifier was Installed on the same day even though 12th July being a Sunday. I would urge others to request for the Installation and not wait for the Brand to call back as it may take time as they offer service according to the Queue. Also, Speed of Installation or Service may take time as per the Service Provider Availability. In my case, the Installation Work was given to their Authorised Service Centre in my area. The Service Guy himself did everything on his own and the Overall Experience was Satisfactory. He asked me for the Prefilter on the call before coming and told me the price to be 700 ( which may vary with Service Provider) which I agreed. After the installation, he said he changed the Inline Sediment Filter as it was defective but being in warranty it won't cost me a buck. He also asked me for my preferred TDS Level and he suggested to set it at 80. One thing to note is that the TDS level can only be set by the Service Guy with the help of a screw and there's no knob or button available to the end-user. Another thing he told me is that the Warranty for the Sediment and Carbon Filters is 6 months and for other filters and Parts is 1 year, In that period, the Respective Parts will be changed free of cost by the Service Guy himself. After the One Year, Only Service will be Free (Visiting and Maintenance Charges) but the Filters or any other parts have to bear by the Consumer (500-1000 for filters and 2500 for water pump). He also suggested changing the Prefilter every 3 months which will cost around 100-200. For other filters, it may vary according to the Water Consumption and the Water Quality of the Source. Although filters should be changed at least once a year. One Important thing to note before buying this particular product which I completely missed is that Kent New Grand doesn't come with a UV lamp inside Storage Tank, whereas it is present in the Newer Model Kent New Grand Plus. I would highly recommend going for that Model as it is only 1000 rupees (at max) more than this one but the extra UV lamp does ensure there are no bacterias present in the Storage Tank itself after all the Purification has been done ( It comes with a 9L tank as compared to 8L).

  The installation request was raised on 16th Dec., however, no one has come to install it, that too even after calling customer care of kent 2-3 times. They assign the installation to one technician, who first told that he can come only between 10:30 AM to 1 PM, which did not match with my office hours, so i requested him to come earlier or in the evening, he didnt agree. I again contacted Kent customer care on Saturday (21 dec.) and requested them to schedule installation at the earliest, they scheduled installation at 3:30 PM same day, however, assigned the installation to the very same person who had been assigned earlier, and as usual he never came. I contacted kent customer care again on Sunday, however, of no use. It has become so difficult to get it installed, had i known it i would have never bought it

  Not filtering properly. Filtered water is containing white thread like particles. No support from customer care side. They are not replacing the faulty parts. Service center technician and owner and Kent Area sales manager all have seen the problem by home visit telling lie to the kent and denying to replace the part . They want me to do Lab test report for the water to get the part replaced.Very BAD SUPPORT from KENT. They don't want to replace the part becoz it is under warranty.NEVER BUY ANYTHING FROM KENT. THEY WILL NOT CHANGE THE PART BECAUSE IT IS UNDER WARRANTY. they will change the parts only when u give them money.

  I used this product from yesterday, so not to put any comments regarding the quality. Delivered on time by ATS, thanks for Amazon but I faced issues whenever I installed the product. After two days later technician came & tell me for purchasing Prefilter (Sediment Filter) which cost is  1650/ & also tell me if I not purchased the Pre-filter he back without installing the product. So I contact the Kent customer service & tell all the issues. After called the helpline I knew the actual price of Prefilter..700/. Nothing happens after lots of conference calld between Kent executive, local dealer & me. Me & my family members was frastete from the brand KENT. As per telephonic discussion with help line they arranged a senior manager call within two hours but write now I am not received any call from KENT HELP LINE CENTRE. Later I feel...this all  things out of my control so I paid 1650 & installed the product. My Local Dealer Name & contact details - GOUTAM PYNE, BANKURA, 8250950073, PIN- 722101, West Bengal.

  Would have given zero rating if it was possible, i have been a kent customer for years and over the years kents service and product has come down to a such low that its useless, feel cheated after buying this product, my advice do not go for kent products and check for alternatives,The installation is supposedly free, but the service engineer will always push for a pre-filter, this was usual and i have experienced this before so i was ok with it, but now these guys have come up with a new concept of pressure reducing valve and says this avoids the purifier from bursting in case of high pressure and also avoids air getting in, now both of these components seems reasonable and cannot be avoided then why is this not provided by default with the purifier as these are part of safety.All this is not even start, the machine i recieved had wrong internal connection of water flow (not sure wether it was wrong or the installation guy had poor knowledge) so he had to correct it, this shocked me as a purifier which is factory assembled and passed their quality and testing check should not ideally have wrong connection.After all this circus the purifier have started leaking water even after the purifier was powered down, and now i have shut the water line to the purifier so that i can avoid flooding of my apartment, and have come to a realization the poor water taste i was facing was because the water was never getting purified and it was just passing through as is.Now this is a clear case of defective product but kent does not have any return or replacement they can only service and i have to hope that they would fix it.

  I Purchased this Product on July 9, 2020, at around 7 pm and it was delivered on July 12, 2020, around 2 pm. I requested for the Installation as soon as receiving the Product and the Service Guy came within an Hour after calling me for the address info. The purifier was Installed on the same day even though 12th July being a Sunday. I would urge others to request for the Installation and not wait for the Brand to call back as it may take time as they offer service according to the Queue. Also, Speed of Installation or Service may take time as per the Service Provider Availability. In my case, the Installation Work was given to their Authorised Service Centre in my area. The Service Guy himself did everything on his own and the Overall Experience was Satisfactory. He asked me for the Prefilter on the call before coming and told me the price to be 700 ( which may vary with Service Provider) which I agreed. After the installation, he said he changed the Inline Sediment Filter as it was defective but being in warranty it won't cost me a buck. He also asked me for my preferred TDS Level and he suggested to set it at 80. One thing to note is that the TDS level can only be set by the Service Guy with the help of a screw and there's no knob or button available to the end-user. Another thing he told me is that the Warranty for the Sediment and Carbon Filters is 6 months and for other filters and Parts is 1 year, In that period, the Respective Parts will be changed free of cost by the Service Guy himself. After the One Year, Only Service will be Free (Visiting and Maintenance Charges) but the Filters or any other parts have to bear by the Consumer (500-1000 for filters and 2500 for water pump). He also suggested changing the Prefilter every 3 months which will cost around 100-200. For other filters, it may vary according to the Water Consumption and the Water Quality of the Source. Although filters should be changed at least once a year. One Important thing to note before buying this particular product which I completely missed is that Kent New Grand doesn't come with a UV lamp inside Storage Tank, whereas it is present in the Newer Model Kent New Grand Plus. I would highly recommend going for that Model as it is only 1000 rupees (at max) more than this one but the extra UV lamp does ensure there are no bacterias present in the Storage Tank itself after all the Purification has been done ( It comes with a 9L tank as compared to 8L). It has all the same features as this one with that extra feature. As for the UV Lamp, it is not mentioned anywhere on Kent's Website or User Manual but by the looks of it, it does feel like a Stainless Steel Chamber (Do ask the Installation Guy or the Customer Service for the same). This was my Overall Experience for now and I opted than any other brand only because of that 3 years Extended AMC they are offering as opposed to their rivals. Thank You.

  The package was opened by KENT service person and he found that UF Membrane cartridge is broken and bypassed the connection.  Also he discouraged online purchase.  Instead of returning, he suggested to lodge a request via KENT Service App.  But it displays that my phone number is not updated.  At the same time it dispalys my  mobile number and address.  If the company do not replace the item, I have to return the unit for replacement

  Packaging was good.Water tastes good.Better than the previous version in terms of design.Installation was done in a timely manner.Storage indicator available but has no light.Required to buy the extra side filter and the cover for the Kent filter.Power consumption is less and purified water is 1 ltr for 2 ltr tap water.

  I recommend don't buy........1 - fake 1 year warranty and 3 year service free .After installation make abnormal sound and highly vibration in Kent RO inner parts ,After many times requested to customer Care no help and no response. Only say \"aapki Puri Shayta ki jayegi ,\"I requested to kent from Kent service app and also from customer Care number but after more then 15 days no service provided .2- price very very high ( same features) then other company and no quality and worst customer Care.3- Kent no free installation, if you call for installation then service person say you must buy prefilter from us and gives price 950 rupye extra. My prefilter buy from Amazon with KENR RO because prefilter recommendation by amazon, service person say you pay 300 rupye extra for your prefilter instaillation and no warranty provide KENT, if you Installation your prefilter ( I call customer care but no more help from Kent service center).4- don't go in brand name and high price because not always right,  brand name and high price.

  Would have given zero rating if it was possible, i have been a kent customer for years and over the years kents service and product has come down to a such low that its useless, feel cheated after buying this product, my advice do not go for kent products and check for alternatives,The installation is supposedly free, but the service engineer will always push for a pre-filter, this was usual and i have experienced this before so i was ok with it, but now these guys have come up with a new concept of pressure reducing valve and says this avoids the purifier from bursting in case of high pressure and also avoids air getting in, now both of these components seems reasonable and cannot be avoided then why is this not provided by default with the purifier as these are part of safety.All this is not even start, the machine i recieved had wrong internal connection of water flow (not sure wether it was wrong or the installation guy had poor knowledge) so he had to correct it, this shocked me as a purifier which is factory assembled and passed their quality and testing check should not ideally have wrong connection.After all this circus the purifier have started leaking water even after the purifier was powered down, and now i have shut the water line to the purifier so that i can avoid flooding of my apartment, and have come to a realization the poor water taste i was facing was because the water was never getting purified and it was just passing through as is.Now this is a clear case of defective product but kent does not have any return or replacement they can only service and i have to hope that they would fix it.

  I Purchased this Product on July 9, 2020, at around 7 pm and it was delivered on July 12, 2020, around 2 pm. I requested for the Installation as soon as receiving the Product and the Service Guy came within an Hour after calling me for the address info. The purifier was Installed on the same day even though 12th July being a Sunday. I would urge others to request for the Installation and not wait for the Brand to call back as it may take time as they offer service according to the Queue. Also, Speed of Installation or Service may take time as per the Service Provider Availability. In my case, the Installation Work was given to their Authorised Service Centre in my area. The Service Guy himself did everything on his own and the Overall Experience was Satisfactory. He asked me for the Prefilter on the call before coming and told me the price to be 700 ( which may vary with Service Provider) which I agreed. After the installation, he said he changed the Inline Sediment Filter as it was defective but being in warranty it won't cost me a buck. He also asked me for my preferred TDS Level and he suggested to set it at 80. One thing to note is that the TDS level can only be set by the Service Guy with the help of a screw and there's no knob or button available to the end-user. Another thing he told me is that the Warranty for the Sediment and Carbon Filters is 6 months and for other filters and Parts is 1 year, In that period, the Respective Parts will be changed free of cost by the Service Guy himself. After the One Year, Only Service will be Free (Visiting and Maintenance Charges) but the Filters or any other parts have to bear by the Consumer (500-1000 for filters and 2500 for water pump). He also suggested changing the Prefilter every 3 months which will cost around 100-200. For other filters, it may vary according to the Water Consumption and the Water Quality of the Source. Although filters should be changed at least once a year. One Important thing to note before buying this particular product which I completely missed is that Kent New Grand doesn't come with a UV lamp inside Storage Tank, whereas it is present in the Newer Model Kent New Grand Plus. I would highly recommend going for that Model as it is only 1000 rupees (at max) more than this one but the extra UV lamp does ensure there are no bacterias present in the Storage Tank itself after all the Purification has been done ( It comes with a 9L tank as compared to 8L). It has all the same features as this one with that extra feature. As for the UV Lamp, it is not mentioned anywhere on Kent's Website or User Manual but by the looks of it, it does feel like a Stainless Steel Chamber (Do ask the Installation Guy or the Customer Service for the same). This was my Overall Experience for now and I opted than any other brand only because of that 3 years Extended AMC they are offering as opposed to their rivals. Thank You.

  The package was opened by KENT service person and he found that UF Membrane cartridge is broken and bypassed the connection.  Also he discouraged online purchase.  Instead of returning, he suggested to lodge a request via KENT Service App.  But it displays that my phone number is not updated.  At the same time it dispalys my  mobile number and address.  If the company do not replace the item, I have to return the unit for replacement

  Packaging was good.Water tastes good.Better than the previous version in terms of design.Installation was done in a timely manner.Storage indicator available but has no light.Required to buy the extra side filter and the cover for the Kent filter.Power consumption is less and purified water is 1 ltr for 2 ltr tap water.

  I recommend don't buy........1 - fake 1 year warranty and 3 year service free .After installation make abnormal sound and highly vibration in Kent RO inner parts ,After many times requested to customer Care no help and no response. Only say \"aapki Puri Shayta ki jayegi ,\"I requested to kent from Kent service app and also from customer Care number but after more then 15 days no service provided .2- price very very high ( same features) then other company and no quality and worst customer Care.3- Kent no free installation, if you call for installation then service person say you must buy prefilter from us and gives price 950 rupye extra. My prefilter buy from Amazon with KENR RO because prefilter recommendation by amazon, service person say you pay 300 rupye extra for your prefilter instaillation and no warranty provide KENT, if you Installation your prefilter ( I call customer care but no more help from Kent service center).4- don't go in brand name and high price because not always right,  brand name and high price.

  The installation request was raised on 16th Dec., however, no one has come to install it, that too even after calling customer care of kent 2-3 times. They assign the installation to one technician, who first told that he can come only between 10:30 AM to 1 PM, which did not match with my office hours, so i requested him to come earlier or in the evening, he didnt agree. I again contacted Kent customer care on Saturday (21 dec.) and requested them to schedule installation at the earliest, they scheduled installation at 3:30 PM same day, however, assigned the installation to the very same person who had been assigned earlier, and as usual he never came. I contacted kent customer care again on Sunday, however, of no use. It has become so difficult to get it installed, had i known it i would have never bought it

  Not filtering properly. Filtered water is containing white thread like particles. No support from customer care side. They are not replacing the faulty parts. Service center technician and owner and Kent Area sales manager all have seen the problem by home visit telling lie to the kent and denying to replace the part . They want me to do Lab test report for the water to get the part replaced.Very BAD SUPPORT from KENT. They don't want to replace the part becoz it is under warranty.NEVER BUY ANYTHING FROM KENT. THEY WILL NOT CHANGE THE PART BECAUSE IT IS UNDER WARRANTY. they will change the parts only when u give them money.

  I used this product from yesterday, so not to put any comments regarding the quality. Delivered on time by ATS, thanks for Amazon but I faced issues whenever I installed the product. After two days later technician came & tell me for purchasing Prefilter (Sediment Filter) which cost is  1650/ & also tell me if I not purchased the Pre-filter he back without installing the product. So I contact the Kent customer service & tell all the issues. After called the helpline I knew the actual price of Prefilter..700/. Nothing happens after lots of conference calld between Kent executive, local dealer & me. Me & my family members was frastete from the brand KENT. As per telephonic discussion with help line they arranged a senior manager call within two hours but write now I am not received any call from KENT HELP LINE CENTRE. Later I feel...this all  things out of my control so I paid 1650 & installed the product. My Local Dealer Name & contact details - GOUTAM PYNE, BANKURA, 8250950073, PIN- 722101, West Bengal.

It has all the same features as this one with that extra feature. As for the UV Lamp, it is not mentioned anywhere on Kent's Website or User Manual but by the looks of it, it does feel like a Stainless Steel Chamber (Do ask the Installation Guy or the Customer Service for the same). This was my Overall Experience for now and I opted than any other brand only because of that 3 years Extended AMC they are offering as opposed to their rivals. Thank You.

  The package was opened by KENT service person and he found that UF Membrane cartridge is broken and bypassed the connection.  Also he discouraged online purchase.  Instead of returning, he suggested to lodge a request via KENT Service App.  But it displays that my phone number is not updated.  At the same time it dispalys my  mobile number and address.  If the company do not replace the item, I have to return the unit for replacement

  Packaging was good.Water tastes good.Better than the previous version in terms of design.Installation was done in a timely manner.Storage indicator available but has no light.Required to buy the extra side filter and the cover for the Kent filter.Power consumption is less and purified water is 1 ltr for 2 ltr tap water.

  I recommend don't buy........1 - fake 1 year warranty and 3 year service free .After installation make abnormal sound and highly vibration in Kent RO inner parts ,After many times requested to customer Care no help and no response. Only say \"aapki Puri Shayta ki jayegi ,\"I requested to kent from Kent service app and also from customer Care number but after more then 15 days no service provided .2- price very very high ( same features) then other company and no quality and worst customer Care.3- Kent no free installation, if you call for installation then service person say you must buy prefilter from us and gives price 950 rupye extra. My prefilter buy from Amazon with KENR RO because prefilter recommendation by amazon, service person say you pay 300 rupye extra for your prefilter instaillation and no warranty provide KENT, if you Installation your prefilter ( I call customer care but no more help from Kent service center).4- don't go in brand name and high price because not always right,  brand name and high price.

  The installation request was raised on 16th Dec., however, no one has come to install it, that too even after calling customer care of kent 2-3 times. They assign the installation to one technician, who first told that he can come only between 10:30 AM to 1 PM, which did not match with my office hours, so i requested him to come earlier or in the evening, he didnt agree. I again contacted Kent customer care on Saturday (21 dec.) and requested them to schedule installation at the earliest, they scheduled installation at 3:30 PM same day, however, assigned the installation to the very same person who had been assigned earlier, and as usual he never came. I contacted kent customer care again on Sunday, however, of no use. It has become so difficult to get it installed, had i known it i would have never bought it

  Not filtering properly. Filtered water is containing white thread like particles. No support from customer care side. They are not replacing the faulty parts. Service center technician and owner and Kent Area sales manager all have seen the problem by home visit telling lie to the kent and denying to replace the part . They want me to do Lab test report for the water to get the part replaced.Very BAD SUPPORT from KENT. They don't want to replace the part becoz it is under warranty.NEVER BUY ANYTHING FROM KENT. THEY WILL NOT CHANGE THE PART BECAUSE IT IS UNDER WARRANTY. they will change the parts only when u give them money.

  I used this product from yesterday, so not to put any comments regarding the quality. Delivered on time by ATS, thanks for Amazon but I faced issues whenever I installed the product. After two days later technician came & tell me for purchasing Prefilter (Sediment Filter) which cost is  1650/ & also tell me if I not purchased the Pre-filter he back without installing the product. So I contact the Kent customer service & tell all the issues. After called the helpline I knew the actual price of Prefilter..700/. Nothing happens after lots of conference calld between Kent executive, local dealer & me. Me & my family members was frastete from the brand KENT. As per telephonic discussion with help line they arranged a senior manager call within two hours but write now I am not received any call from KENT HELP LINE CENTRE. Later I feel...this all  things out of my control so I paid 1650 & installed the product. My Local Dealer Name & contact details - GOUTAM PYNE, BANKURA, 8250950073, PIN- 722101, West Bengal.

  Would have given zero rating if it was possible, i have been a kent customer for years and over the years kents service and product has come down to a such low that its useless, feel cheated after buying this product, my advice do not go for kent products and check for alternatives,The installation is supposedly free, but the service engineer will always push for a pre-filter, this was usual and i have experienced this before so i was ok with it, but now these guys have come up with a new concept of pressure reducing valve and says this avoids the purifier from bursting in case of high pressure and also avoids air getting in, now both of these components seems reasonable and cannot be avoided then why is this not provided by default with the purifier as these are part of safety.All this is not even start, the machine i recieved had wrong internal connection of water flow (not sure wether it was wrong or the installation guy had poor knowledge) so he had to correct it, this shocked me as a purifier which is factory assembled and passed their quality and testing check should not ideally have wrong connection.After all this circus the purifier have started leaking water even after the purifier was powered down, and now i have shut the water line to the purifier so that i can avoid flooding of my apartment, and have come to a realization the poor water taste i was facing was because the water was never getting purified and it was just passing through as is.Now this is a clear case of defective product but kent does not have any return or replacement they can only service and i have to hope that they would fix it.

  I Purchased this Product on July 9, 2020, at around 7 pm and it was delivered on July 12, 2020, around 2 pm. I requested for the Installation as soon as receiving the Product and the Service Guy came within an Hour after calling me for the address info. The purifier was Installed on the same day even though 12th July being a Sunday. I would urge others to request for the Installation and not wait for the Brand to call back as it may take time as they offer service according to the Queue. Also, Speed of Installation or Service may take time as per the Service Provider Availability. In my case, the Installation Work was given to their Authorised Service Centre in my area. The Service Guy himself did everything on his own and the Overall Experience was Satisfactory. He asked me for the Prefilter on the call before coming and told me the price to be 700 ( which may vary with Service Provider) which I agreed. After the installation, he said he changed the Inline Sediment Filter as it was defective but being in warranty it won't cost me a buck. He also asked me for my preferred TDS Level and he suggested to set it at 80. One thing to note is that the TDS level can only be set by the Service Guy with the help of a screw and there's no knob or button available to the end-user. Another thing he told me is that the Warranty for the Sediment and Carbon Filters is 6 months and for other filters and Parts is 1 year, In that period, the Respective Parts will be changed free of cost by the Service Guy himself. After the One Year, Only Service will be Free (Visiting and Maintenance Charges) but the Filters or any other parts have to bear by the Consumer (500-1000 for filters and 2500 for water pump). He also suggested changing the Prefilter every 3 months which will cost around 100-200. For other filters, it may vary according to the Water Consumption and the Water Quality of the Source. Although filters should be changed at least once a year. One Important thing to note before buying this particular product which I completely missed is that Kent New Grand doesn't come with a UV lamp inside Storage Tank, whereas it is present in the Newer Model Kent New Grand Plus. I would highly recommend going for that Model as it is only 1000 rupees (at max) more than this one but the extra UV lamp does ensure there are no bacterias present in the Storage Tank itself after all the Purification has been done ( It comes with a 9L tank as compared to 8L).

  The installation request was raised on 16th Dec., however, no one has come to install it, that too even after calling customer care of kent 2-3 times. They assign the installation to one technician, who first told that he can come only between 10:30 AM to 1 PM, which did not match with my office hours, so i requested him to come earlier or in the evening, he didnt agree. I again contacted Kent customer care on Saturday (21 dec.) and requested them to schedule installation at the earliest, they scheduled installation at 3:30 PM same day, however, assigned the installation to the very same person who had been assigned earlier, and as usual he never came. I contacted kent customer care again on Sunday, however, of no use. It has become so difficult to get it installed, had i known it i would have never bought it

  Not filtering properly. Filtered water is containing white thread like particles. No support from customer care side. They are not replacing the faulty parts. Service center technician and owner and Kent Area sales manager all have seen the problem by home visit telling lie to the kent and denying to replace the part . They want me to do Lab test report for the water to get the part replaced.Very BAD SUPPORT from KENT. They don't want to replace the part becoz it is under warranty.NEVER BUY ANYTHING FROM KENT. THEY WILL NOT CHANGE THE PART BECAUSE IT IS UNDER WARRANTY. they will change the parts only when u give them money.

  I used this product from yesterday, so not to put any comments regarding the quality. Delivered on time by ATS, thanks for Amazon but I faced issues whenever I installed the product. After two days later technician came & tell me for purchasing Prefilter (Sediment Filter) which cost is  1650/ & also tell me if I not purchased the Pre-filter he back without installing the product. So I contact the Kent customer service & tell all the issues. After called the helpline I knew the actual price of Prefilter..700/. Nothing happens after lots of conference calld between Kent executive, local dealer & me. Me & my family members was frastete from the brand KENT. As per telephonic discussion with help line they arranged a senior manager call within two hours but write now I am not received any call from KENT HELP LINE CENTRE. Later I feel...this all  things out of my control so I paid 1650 & installed the product. My Local Dealer Name & contact details - GOUTAM PYNE, BANKURA, 8250950073, PIN- 722101, West Bengal.

  Would have given zero rating if it was possible, i have been a kent customer for years and over the years kents service and product has come down to a such low that its useless, feel cheated after buying this product, my advice do not go for kent products and check for alternatives,The installation is supposedly free, but the service engineer will always push for a pre-filter, this was usual and i have experienced this before so i was ok with it, but now these guys have come up with a new concept of pressure reducing valve and says this avoids the purifier from bursting in case of high pressure and also avoids air getting in, now both of these components seems reasonable and cannot be avoided then why is this not provided by default with the purifier as these are part of safety.All this is not even start, the machine i recieved had wrong internal connection of water flow (not sure wether it was wrong or the installation guy had poor knowledge) so he had to correct it, this shocked me as a purifier which is factory assembled and passed their quality and testing check should not ideally have wrong connection.After all this circus the purifier have started leaking water even after the purifier was powered down, and now i have shut the water line to the purifier so that i can avoid flooding of my apartment, and have come to a realization the poor water taste i was facing was because the water was never getting purified and it was just passing through as is.Now this is a clear case of defective product but kent does not have any return or replacement they can only service and i have to hope that they would fix it.

  I Purchased this Product on July 9, 2020, at around 7 pm and it was delivered on July 12, 2020, around 2 pm. I requested for the Installation as soon as receiving the Product and the Service Guy came within an Hour after calling me for the address info. The purifier was Installed on the same day even though 12th July being a Sunday. I would urge others to request for the Installation and not wait for the Brand to call back as it may take time as they offer service according to the Queue. Also, Speed of Installation or Service may take time as per the Service Provider Availability. In my case, the Installation Work was given to their Authorised Service Centre in my area. The Service Guy himself did everything on his own and the Overall Experience was Satisfactory. He asked me for the Prefilter on the call before coming and told me the price to be 700 ( which may vary with Service Provider) which I agreed. After the installation, he said he changed the Inline Sediment Filter as it was defective but being in warranty it won't cost me a buck. He also asked me for my preferred TDS Level and he suggested to set it at 80. One thing to note is that the TDS level can only be set by the Service Guy with the help of a screw and there's no knob or button available to the end-user. Another thing he told me is that the Warranty for the Sediment and Carbon Filters is 6 months and for other filters and Parts is 1 year, In that period, the Respective Parts will be changed free of cost by the Service Guy himself. After the One Year, Only Service will be Free (Visiting and Maintenance Charges) but the Filters or any other parts have to bear by the Consumer (500-1000 for filters and 2500 for water pump). He also suggested changing the Prefilter every 3 months which will cost around 100-200. For other filters, it may vary according to the Water Consumption and the Water Quality of the Source. Although filters should be changed at least once a year. One Important thing to note before buying this particular product which I completely missed is that Kent New Grand doesn't come with a UV lamp inside Storage Tank, whereas it is present in the Newer Model Kent New Grand Plus. I would highly recommend going for that Model as it is only 1000 rupees (at max) more than this one but the extra UV lamp does ensure there are no bacterias present in the Storage Tank itself after all the Purification has been done ( It comes with a 9L tank as compared to 8L). It has all the same features as this one with that extra feature. As for the UV Lamp, it is not mentioned anywhere on Kent's Website or User Manual but by the looks of it, it does feel like a Stainless Steel Chamber (Do ask the Installation Guy or the Customer Service for the same). This was my Overall Experience for now and I opted than any other brand only because of that 3 years Extended AMC they are offering as opposed to their rivals. Thank You.

  The package was opened by KENT service person and he found that UF Membrane cartridge is broken and bypassed the connection.  Also he discouraged online purchase.  Instead of returning, he suggested to lodge a request via KENT Service App.  But it displays that my phone number is not updated.  At the same time it dispalys my  mobile number and address.  If the company do not replace the item, I have to return the unit for replacement

  Packaging was good.Water tastes good.Better than the previous version in terms of design.Installation was done in a timely manner.Storage indicator available but has no light.Required to buy the extra side filter and the cover for the Kent filter.Power consumption is less and purified water is 1 ltr for 2 ltr tap water.

  I recommend don't buy........1 - fake 1 year warranty and 3 year service free .After installation make abnormal sound and highly vibration in Kent RO inner parts ,After many times requested to customer Care no help and no response. Only say \"aapki Puri Shayta ki jayegi ,\"I requested to kent from Kent service app and also from customer Care number but after more then 15 days no service provided .2- price very very high ( same features) then other company and no quality and worst customer Care.3- Kent no free installation, if you call for installation then service person say you must buy prefilter from us and gives price 950 rupye extra. My prefilter buy from Amazon with KENR RO because prefilter recommendation by amazon, service person say you pay 300 rupye extra for your prefilter instaillation and no warranty provide KENT, if you Installation your prefilter ( I call customer care but no more help from Kent service center).4- don't go in brand name and high price because not always right,  brand name and high price.

  Would have given zero rating if it was possible, i have been a kent customer for years and over the years kents service and product has come down to a such low that its useless, feel cheated after buying this product, my advice do not go for kent products and check for alternatives,The installation is supposedly free, but the service engineer will always push for a pre-filter, this was usual and i have experienced this before so i was ok with it, but now these guys have come up with a new concept of pressure reducing valve and says this avoids the purifier from bursting in case of high pressure and also avoids air getting in, now both of these components seems reasonable and cannot be avoided then why is this not provided by default with the purifier as these are part of safety.All this is not even start, the machine i recieved had wrong internal connection of water flow (not sure wether it was wrong or the installation guy had poor knowledge) so he had to correct it, this shocked me as a purifier which is factory assembled and passed their quality and testing check should not ideally have wrong connection.After all this circus the purifier have started leaking water even after the purifier was powered down, and now i have shut the water line to the purifier so that i can avoid flooding of my apartment, and have come to a realization the poor water taste i was facing was because the water was never getting purified and it was just passing through as is.Now this is a clear case of defective product but kent does not have any return or replacement they can only service and i have to hope that they would fix it.

  I Purchased this Product on July 9, 2020, at around 7 pm and it was delivered on July 12, 2020, around 2 pm. I requested for the Installation as soon as receiving the Product and the Service Guy came within an Hour after calling me for the address info. The purifier was Installed on the same day even though 12th July being a Sunday. I would urge others to request for the Installation and not wait for the Brand to call back as it may take time as they offer service according to the Queue. Also, Speed of Installation or Service may take time as per the Service Provider Availability. In my case, the Installation Work was given to their Authorised Service Centre in my area. The Service Guy himself did everything on his own and the Overall Experience was Satisfactory. He asked me for the Prefilter on the call before coming and told me the price to be 700 ( which may vary with Service Provider) which I agreed. After the installation, he said he changed the Inline Sediment Filter as it was defective but being in warranty it won't cost me a buck. He also asked me for my preferred TDS Level and he suggested to set it at 80. One thing to note is that the TDS level can only be set by the Service Guy with the help of a screw and there's no knob or button available to the end-user. Another thing he told me is that the Warranty for the Sediment and Carbon Filters is 6 months and for other filters and Parts is 1 year, In that period, the Respective Parts will be changed free of cost by the Service Guy himself. After the One Year, Only Service will be Free (Visiting and Maintenance Charges) but the Filters or any other parts have to bear by the Consumer (500-1000 for filters and 2500 for water pump). He also suggested changing the Prefilter every 3 months which will cost around 100-200. For other filters, it may vary according to the Water Consumption and the Water Quality of the Source. Although filters should be changed at least once a year. One Important thing to note before buying this particular product which I completely missed is that Kent New Grand doesn't come with a UV lamp inside Storage Tank, whereas it is present in the Newer Model Kent New Grand Plus. I would highly recommend going for that Model as it is only 1000 rupees (at max) more than this one but the extra UV lamp does ensure there are no bacterias present in the Storage Tank itself after all the Purification has been done ( It comes with a 9L tank as compared to 8L). It has all the same features as this one with that extra feature. As for the UV Lamp, it is not mentioned anywhere on Kent's Website or User Manual but by the looks of it, it does feel like a Stainless Steel Chamber (Do ask the Installation Guy or the Customer Service for the same). This was my Overall Experience for now and I opted than any other brand only because of that 3 years Extended AMC they are offering as opposed to their rivals. Thank You.

  The package was opened by KENT service person and he found that UF Membrane cartridge is broken and bypassed the connection.  Also he discouraged online purchase.  Instead of returning, he suggested to lodge a request via KENT Service App.  But it displays that my phone number is not updated.  At the same time it dispalys my  mobile number and address.  If the company do not replace the item, I have to return the unit for replacement

  Packaging was good.Water tastes good.Better than the previous version in terms of design.Installation was done in a timely manner.Storage indicator available but has no light.Required to buy the extra side filter and the cover for the Kent filter.Power consumption is less and purified water is 1 ltr for 2 ltr tap water.

  I recommend don't buy........1 - fake 1 year warranty and 3 year service free .After installation make abnormal sound and highly vibration in Kent RO inner parts ,After many times requested to customer Care no help and no response. Only say \"aapki Puri Shayta ki jayegi ,\"I requested to kent from Kent service app and also from customer Care number but after more then 15 days no service provided .2- price very very high ( same features) then other company and no quality and worst customer Care.3- Kent no free installation, if you call for installation then service person say you must buy prefilter from us and gives price 950 rupye extra. My prefilter buy from Amazon with KENR RO because prefilter recommendation by amazon, service person say you pay 300 rupye extra for your prefilter instaillation and no warranty provide KENT, if you Installation your prefilter ( I call customer care but no more help from Kent service center).4- don't go in brand name and high price because not always right,  brand name and high price.

  The installation request was raised on 16th Dec., however, no one has come to install it, that too even after calling customer care of kent 2-3 times. They assign the installation to one technician, who first told that he can come only between 10:30 AM to 1 PM, which did not match with my office hours, so i requested him to come earlier or in the evening, he didnt agree. I again contacted Kent customer care on Saturday (21 dec.) and requested them to schedule installation at the earliest, they scheduled installation at 3:30 PM same day, however, assigned the installation to the very same person who had been assigned earlier, and as usual he never came. I contacted kent customer care again on Sunday, however, of no use. It has become so difficult to get it installed, had i known it i would have never bought it

  Not filtering properly. Filtered water is containing white thread like particles. No support from customer care side. They are not replacing the faulty parts. Service center technician and owner and Kent Area sales manager all have seen the problem by home visit telling lie to the kent and denying to replace the part . They want me to do Lab test report for the water to get the part replaced.Very BAD SUPPORT from KENT. They don't want to replace the part becoz it is under warranty.NEVER BUY ANYTHING FROM KENT. THEY WILL NOT CHANGE THE PART BECAUSE IT IS UNDER WARRANTY. they will change the parts only when u give them money.

  I used this product from yesterday, so not to put any comments regarding the quality. Delivered on time by ATS, thanks for Amazon but I faced issues whenever I installed the product. After two days later technician came & tell me for purchasing Prefilter (Sediment Filter) which cost is  1650/ & also tell me if I not purchased the Pre-filter he back without installing the product. So I contact the Kent customer service & tell all the issues. After called the helpline I knew the actual price of Prefilter..700/. Nothing happens after lots of conference calld between Kent executive, local dealer & me. Me & my family members was frastete from the brand KENT. As per telephonic discussion with help line they arranged a senior manager call within two hours but write now I am not received any call from KENT HELP LINE CENTRE. Later I feel...this all  things out of my control so I paid 1650 & installed the product. My Local Dealer Name & contact details - GOUTAM PYNE, BANKURA, 8250950073, PIN- 722101, West Bengal.

It has all the same features as this one with that extra feature. As for the UV Lamp, it is not mentioned anywhere on Kent's Website or User Manual but by the looks of it, it does feel like a Stainless Steel Chamber (Do ask the Installation Guy or the Customer Service for the same). This was my Overall Experience for now and I opted than any other brand only because of that 3 years Extended AMC they are offering as opposed to their rivals. Thank You.

  The package was opened by KENT service person and he found that UF Membrane cartridge is broken and bypassed the connection.  Also he discouraged online purchase.  Instead of returning, he suggested to lodge a request via KENT Service App.  But it displays that my phone number is not updated.  At the same time it dispalys my  mobile number and address.  If the company do not replace the item, I have to return the unit for replacement

  Packaging was good.Water tastes good.Better than the previous version in terms of design.Installation was done in a timely manner.Storage indicator available but has no light.Required to buy the extra side filter and the cover for the Kent filter.Power consumption is less and purified water is 1 ltr for 2 ltr tap water.

  I recommend don't buy........1 - fake 1 year warranty and 3 year service free .After installation make abnormal sound and highly vibration in Kent RO inner parts ,After many times requested to customer Care no help and no response. Only say \"aapki Puri Shayta ki jayegi ,\"I requested to kent from Kent service app and also from customer Care number but after more then 15 days no service provided .2- price very very high ( same features) then other company and no quality and worst customer Care.3- Kent no free installation, if you call for installation then service person say you must buy prefilter from us and gives price 950 rupye extra. My prefilter buy from Amazon with KENR RO because prefilter recommendation by amazon, service person say you pay 300 rupye extra for your prefilter instaillation and no warranty provide KENT, if you Installation your prefilter ( I call customer care but no more help from Kent service center).4- don't go in brand name and high price because not always right,  brand name and high price.

  The installation request was raised on 16th Dec., however, no one has come to install it, that too even after calling customer care of kent 2-3 times. They assign the installation to one technician, who first told that he can come only between 10:30 AM to 1 PM, which did not match with my office hours, so i requested him to come earlier or in the evening, he didnt agree. I again contacted Kent customer care on Saturday (21 dec.) and requested them to schedule installation at the earliest, they scheduled installation at 3:30 PM same day, however, assigned the installation to the very same person who had been assigned earlier, and as usual he never came. I contacted kent customer care again on Sunday, however, of no use. It has become so difficult to get it installed, had i known it i would have never bought it

  Not filtering properly. Filtered water is containing white thread like particles. No support from customer care side. They are not replacing the faulty parts. Service center technician and owner and Kent Area sales manager all have seen the problem by home visit telling lie to the kent and denying to replace the part . They want me to do Lab test report for the water to get the part replaced.Very BAD SUPPORT from KENT. They don't want to replace the part becoz it is under warranty.NEVER BUY ANYTHING FROM KENT. THEY WILL NOT CHANGE THE PART BECAUSE IT IS UNDER WARRANTY. they will change the parts only when u give them money.

  I used this product from yesterday, so not to put any comments regarding the quality. Delivered on time by ATS, thanks for Amazon but I faced issues whenever I installed the product. After two days later technician came & tell me for purchasing Prefilter (Sediment Filter) which cost is  1650/ & also tell me if I not purchased the Pre-filter he back without installing the product. So I contact the Kent customer service & tell all the issues. After called the helpline I knew the actual price of Prefilter..700/. Nothing happens after lots of conference calld between Kent executive, local dealer & me. Me & my family members was frastete from the brand KENT. As per telephonic discussion with help line they arranged a senior manager call within two hours but write now I am not received any call from KENT HELP LINE CENTRE. Later I feel...this all  things out of my control so I paid 1650 & installed the product. My Local Dealer Name & contact details - GOUTAM PYNE, BANKURA, 8250950073, PIN- 722101, West Bengal.

  Would have given zero rating if it was possible, i have been a kent customer for years and over the years kents service and product has come down to a such low that its useless, feel cheated after buying this product, my advice do not go for kent products and check for alternatives,The installation is supposedly free, but the service engineer will always push for a pre-filter, this was usual and i have experienced this before so i was ok with it, but now these guys have come up with a new concept of pressure reducing valve and says this avoids the purifier from bursting in case of high pressure and also avoids air getting in, now both of these components seems reasonable and cannot be avoided then why is this not provided by default with the purifier as these are part of safety.All this is not even start, the machine i recieved had wrong internal connection of water flow (not sure wether it was wrong or the installation guy had poor knowledge) so he had to correct it, this shocked me as a purifier which is factory assembled and passed their quality and testing check should not ideally have wrong connection.After all this circus the purifier have started leaking water even after the purifier was powered down, and now i have shut the water line to the purifier so that i can avoid flooding of my apartment, and have come to a realization the poor water taste i was facing was because the water was never getting purified and it was just passing through as is.Now this is a clear case of defective product but kent does not have any return or replacement they can only service and i have to hope that they would fix it.

  I Purchased this Product on July 9, 2020, at around 7 pm and it was delivered on July 12, 2020, around 2 pm. I requested for the Installation as soon as receiving the Product and the Service Guy came within an Hour after calling me for the address info. The purifier was Installed on the same day even though 12th July being a Sunday. I would urge others to request for the Installation and not wait for the Brand to call back as it may take time as they offer service according to the Queue. Also, Speed of Installation or Service may take time as per the Service Provider Availability. In my case, the Installation Work was given to their Authorised Service Centre in my area. The Service Guy himself did everything on his own and the Overall Experience was Satisfactory. He asked me for the Prefilter on the call before coming and told me the price to be 700 ( which may vary with Service Provider) which I agreed. After the installation, he said he changed the Inline Sediment Filter as it was defective but being in warranty it won't cost me a buck. He also asked me for my preferred TDS Level and he suggested to set it at 80. One thing to note is that the TDS level can only be set by the Service Guy with the help of a screw and there's no knob or button available to the end-user. Another thing he told me is that the Warranty for the Sediment and Carbon Filters is 6 months and for other filters and Parts is 1 year, In that period, the Respective Parts will be changed free of cost by the Service Guy himself. After the One Year, Only Service will be Free (Visiting and Maintenance Charges) but the Filters or any other parts have to bear by the Consumer (500-1000 for filters and 2500 for water pump). He also suggested changing the Prefilter every 3 months which will cost around 100-200. For other filters, it may vary according to the Water Consumption and the Water Quality of the Source. Although filters should be changed at least once a year. One Important thing to note before buying this particular product which I completely missed is that Kent New Grand doesn't come with a UV lamp inside Storage Tank, whereas it is present in the Newer Model Kent New Grand Plus. I would highly recommend going for that Model as it is only 1000 rupees (at max) more than this one but the extra UV lamp does ensure there are no bacterias present in the Storage Tank itself after all the Purification has been done ( It comes with a 9L tank as compared to 8L).

  The installation request was raised on 16th Dec., however, no one has come to install it, that too even after calling customer care of kent 2-3 times. They assign the installation to one technician, who first told that he can come only between 10:30 AM to 1 PM, which did not match with my office hours, so i requested him to come earlier or in the evening, he didnt agree. I again contacted Kent customer care on Saturday (21 dec.) and requested them to schedule installation at the earliest, they scheduled installation at 3:30 PM same day, however, assigned the installation to the very same person who had been assigned earlier, and as usual he never came. I contacted kent customer care again on Sunday, however, of no use. It has become so difficult to get it installed, had i known it i would have never bought it

  Not filtering properly. Filtered water is containing white thread like particles. No support from customer care side. They are not replacing the faulty parts. Service center technician and owner and Kent Area sales manager all have seen the problem by home visit telling lie to the kent and denying to replace the part . They want me to do Lab test report for the water to get the part replaced.Very BAD SUPPORT from KENT. They don't want to replace the part becoz it is under warranty.NEVER BUY ANYTHING FROM KENT. THEY WILL NOT CHANGE THE PART BECAUSE IT IS UNDER WARRANTY. they will change the parts only when u give them money.

  I used this product from yesterday, so not to put any comments regarding the quality. Delivered on time by ATS, thanks for Amazon but I faced issues whenever I installed the product. After two days later technician came & tell me for purchasing Prefilter (Sediment Filter) which cost is  1650/ & also tell me if I not purchased the Pre-filter he back without installing the product. So I contact the Kent customer service & tell all the issues. After called the helpline I knew the actual price of Prefilter..700/. Nothing happens after lots of conference calld between Kent executive, local dealer & me. Me & my family members was frastete from the brand KENT. As per telephonic discussion with help line they arranged a senior manager call within two hours but write now I am not received any call from KENT HELP LINE CENTRE. Later I feel...this all  things out of my control so I paid 1650 & installed the product. My Local Dealer Name & contact details - GOUTAM PYNE, BANKURA, 8250950073, PIN- 722101, West Bengal.

  Would have given zero rating if it was possible, i have been a kent customer for years and over the years kents service and product has come down to a such low that its useless, feel cheated after buying this product, my advice do not go for kent products and check for alternatives,The installation is supposedly free, but the service engineer will always push for a pre-filter, this was usual and i have experienced this before so i was ok with it, but now these guys have come up with a new concept of pressure reducing valve and says this avoids the purifier from bursting in case of high pressure and also avoids air getting in, now both of these components seems reasonable and cannot be avoided then why is this not provided by default with the purifier as these are part of safety.All this is not even start, the machine i recieved had wrong internal connection of water flow (not sure wether it was wrong or the installation guy had poor knowledge) so he had to correct it, this shocked me as a purifier which is factory assembled and passed their quality and testing check should not ideally have wrong connection.After all this circus the purifier have started leaking water even after the purifier was powered down, and now i have shut the water line to the purifier so that i can avoid flooding of my apartment, and have come to a realization the poor water taste i was facing was because the water was never getting purified and it was just passing through as is.Now this is a clear case of defective product but kent does not have any return or replacement they can only service and i have to hope that they would fix it.

  I Purchased this Product on July 9, 2020, at around 7 pm and it was delivered on July 12, 2020, around 2 pm. I requested for the Installation as soon as receiving the Product and the Service Guy came within an Hour after calling me for the address info. The purifier was Installed on the same day even though 12th July being a Sunday. I would urge others to request for the Installation and not wait for the Brand to call back as it may take time as they offer service according to the Queue. Also, Speed of Installation or Service may take time as per the Service Provider Availability. In my case, the Installation Work was given to their Authorised Service Centre in my area. The Service Guy himself did everything on his own and the Overall Experience was Satisfactory. He asked me for the Prefilter on the call before coming and told me the price to be 700 ( which may vary with Service Provider) which I agreed. After the installation, he said he changed the Inline Sediment Filter as it was defective but being in warranty it won't cost me a buck. He also asked me for my preferred TDS Level and he suggested to set it at 80. One thing to note is that the TDS level can only be set by the Service Guy with the help of a screw and there's no knob or button available to the end-user. Another thing he told me is that the Warranty for the Sediment and Carbon Filters is 6 months and for other filters and Parts is 1 year, In that period, the Respective Parts will be changed free of cost by the Service Guy himself. After the One Year, Only Service will be Free (Visiting and Maintenance Charges) but the Filters or any other parts have to bear by the Consumer (500-1000 for filters and 2500 for water pump). He also suggested changing the Prefilter every 3 months which will cost around 100-200. For other filters, it may vary according to the Water Consumption and the Water Quality of the Source. Although filters should be changed at least once a year. One Important thing to note before buying this particular product which I completely missed is that Kent New Grand doesn't come with a UV lamp inside Storage Tank, whereas it is present in the Newer Model Kent New Grand Plus. I would highly recommend going for that Model as it is only 1000 rupees (at max) more than this one but the extra UV lamp does ensure there are no bacterias present in the Storage Tank itself after all the Purification has been done ( It comes with a 9L tank as compared to 8L). It has all the same features as this one with that extra feature. As for the UV Lamp, it is not mentioned anywhere on Kent's Website or User Manual but by the looks of it, it does feel like a Stainless Steel Chamber (Do ask the Installation Guy or the Customer Service for the same). This was my Overall Experience for now and I opted than any other brand only because of that 3 years Extended AMC they are offering as opposed to their rivals. Thank You.

  The package was opened by KENT service person and he found that UF Membrane cartridge is broken and bypassed the connection.  Also he discouraged online purchase.  Instead of returning, he suggested to lodge a request via KENT Service App.  But it displays that my phone number is not updated.  At the same time it dispalys my  mobile number and address.  If the company do not replace the item, I have to return the unit for replacement

  Packaging was good.Water tastes good.Better than the previous version in terms of design.Installation was done in a timely manner.Storage indicator available but has no light.Required to buy the extra side filter and the cover for the Kent filter.Power consumption is less and purified water is 1 ltr for 2 ltr tap water.

  I recommend don't buy........1 - fake 1 year warranty and 3 year service free .After installation make abnormal sound and highly vibration in Kent RO inner parts ,After many times requested to customer Care no help and no response. Only say \"aapki Puri Shayta ki jayegi ,\"I requested to kent from Kent service app and also from customer Care number but after more then 15 days no service provided .2- price very very high ( same features) then other company and no quality and worst customer Care.3- Kent no free installation, if you call for installation then service person say you must buy prefilter from us and gives price 950 rupye extra. My prefilter buy from Amazon with KENR RO because prefilter recommendation by amazon, service person say you pay 300 rupye extra for your prefilter instaillation and no warranty provide KENT, if you Installation your prefilter ( I call customer care but no more help from Kent service center).4- don't go in brand name and high price because not always right,  brand name and high price.

  Would have given zero rating if it was possible, i have been a kent customer for years and over the years kents service and product has come down to a such low that its useless, feel cheated after buying this product, my advice do not go for kent products and check for alternatives,The installation is supposedly free, but the service engineer will always push for a pre-filter, this was usual and i have experienced this before so i was ok with it, but now these guys have come up with a new concept of pressure reducing valve and says this avoids the purifier from bursting in case of high pressure and also avoids air getting in, now both of these components seems reasonable and cannot be avoided then why is this not provided by default with the purifier as these are part of safety.All this is not even start, the machine i recieved had wrong internal connection of water flow (not sure wether it was wrong or the installation guy had poor knowledge) so he had to correct it, this shocked me as a purifier which is factory assembled and passed their quality and testing check should not ideally have wrong connection.After all this circus the purifier have started leaking water even after the purifier was powered down, and now i have shut the water line to the purifier so that i can avoid flooding of my apartment, and have come to a realization the poor water taste i was facing was because the water was never getting purified and it was just passing through as is.Now this is a clear case of defective product but kent does not have any return or replacement they can only service and i have to hope that they would fix it.

  I Purchased this Product on July 9, 2020, at around 7 pm and it was delivered on July 12, 2020, around 2 pm. I requested for the Installation as soon as receiving the Product and the Service Guy came within an Hour after calling me for the address info. The purifier was Installed on the same day even though 12th July being a Sunday. I would urge others to request for the Installation and not wait for the Brand to call back as it may take time as they offer service according to the Queue. Also, Speed of Installation or Service may take time as per the Service Provider Availability. In my case, the Installation Work was given to their Authorised Service Centre in my area. The Service Guy himself did everything on his own and the Overall Experience was Satisfactory. He asked me for the Prefilter on the call before coming and told me the price to be 700 ( which may vary with Service Provider) which I agreed. After the installation, he said he changed the Inline Sediment Filter as it was defective but being in warranty it won't cost me a buck. He also asked me for my preferred TDS Level and he suggested to set it at 80. One thing to note is that the TDS level can only be set by the Service Guy with the help of a screw and there's no knob or button available to the end-user. Another thing he told me is that the Warranty for the Sediment and Carbon Filters is 6 months and for other filters and Parts is 1 year, In that period, the Respective Parts will be changed free of cost by the Service Guy himself. After the One Year, Only Service will be Free (Visiting and Maintenance Charges) but the Filters or any other parts have to bear by the Consumer (500-1000 for filters and 2500 for water pump). He also suggested changing the Prefilter every 3 months which will cost around 100-200. For other filters, it may vary according to the Water Consumption and the Water Quality of the Source. Although filters should be changed at least once a year. One Important thing to note before buying this particular product which I completely missed is that Kent New Grand doesn't come with a UV lamp inside Storage Tank, whereas it is present in the Newer Model Kent New Grand Plus. I would highly recommend going for that Model as it is only 1000 rupees (at max) more than this one but the extra UV lamp does ensure there are no bacterias present in the Storage Tank itself after all the Purification has been done ( It comes with a 9L tank as compared to 8L). It has all the same features as this one with that extra feature. As for the UV Lamp, it is not mentioned anywhere on Kent's Website or User Manual but by the looks of it, it does feel like a Stainless Steel Chamber (Do ask the Installation Guy or the Customer Service for the same). This was my Overall Experience for now and I opted than any other brand only because of that 3 years Extended AMC they are offering as opposed to their rivals. Thank You.

  The package was opened by KENT service person and he found that UF Membrane cartridge is broken and bypassed the connection.  Also he discouraged online purchase.  Instead of returning, he suggested to lodge a request via KENT Service App.  But it displays that my phone number is not updated.  At the same time it dispalys my  mobile number and address.  If the company do not replace the item, I have to return the unit for replacement

  Packaging was good.Water tastes good.Better than the previous version in terms of design.Installation was done in a timely manner.Storage indicator available but has no light.Required to buy the extra side filter and the cover for the Kent filter.Power consumption is less and purified water is 1 ltr for 2 ltr tap water.

  I recommend don't buy........1 - fake 1 year warranty and 3 year service free .After installation make abnormal sound and highly vibration in Kent RO inner parts ,After many times requested to customer Care no help and no response. Only say \"aapki Puri Shayta ki jayegi ,\"I requested to kent from Kent service app and also from customer Care number but after more then 15 days no service provided .2- price very very high ( same features) then other company and no quality and worst customer Care.3- Kent no free installation, if you call for installation then service person say you must buy prefilter from us and gives price 950 rupye extra. My prefilter buy from Amazon with KENR RO because prefilter recommendation by amazon, service person say you pay 300 rupye extra for your prefilter instaillation and no warranty provide KENT, if you Installation your prefilter ( I call customer care but no more help from Kent service center).4- don't go in brand name and high price because not always right,  brand name and high price.

  The installation request was raised on 16th Dec., however, no one has come to install it, that too even after calling customer care of kent 2-3 times. They assign the installation to one technician, who first told that he can come only between 10:30 AM to 1 PM, which did not match with my office hours, so i requested him to come earlier or in the evening, he didnt agree. I again contacted Kent customer care on Saturday (21 dec.) and requested them to schedule installation at the earliest, they scheduled installation at 3:30 PM same day, however, assigned the installation to the very same person who had been assigned earlier, and as usual he never came. I contacted kent customer care again on Sunday, however, of no use. It has become so difficult to get it installed, had i known it i would have never bought it

  Not filtering properly. Filtered water is containing white thread like particles. No support from customer care side. They are not replacing the faulty parts. Service center technician and owner and Kent Area sales manager all have seen the problem by home visit telling lie to the kent and denying to replace the part . They want me to do Lab test report for the water to get the part replaced.Very BAD SUPPORT from KENT. They don't want to replace the part becoz it is under warranty.NEVER BUY ANYTHING FROM KENT. THEY WILL NOT CHANGE THE PART BECAUSE IT IS UNDER WARRANTY. they will change the parts only when u give them money.

  I used this product from yesterday, so not to put any comments regarding the quality. Delivered on time by ATS, thanks for Amazon but I faced issues whenever I installed the product. After two days later technician came & tell me for purchasing Prefilter (Sediment Filter) which cost is  1650/ & also tell me if I not purchased the Pre-filter he back without installing the product. So I contact the Kent customer service & tell all the issues. After called the helpline I knew the actual price of Prefilter..700/. Nothing happens after lots of conference calld between Kent executive, local dealer & me. Me & my family members was frastete from the brand KENT. As per telephonic discussion with help line they arranged a senior manager call within two hours but write now I am not received any call from KENT HELP LINE CENTRE. Later I feel...this all  things out of my control so I paid 1650 & installed the product. My Local Dealer Name & contact details - GOUTAM PYNE, BANKURA, 8250950073, PIN- 722101, West Bengal.

It has all the same features as this one with that extra feature. As for the UV Lamp, it is not mentioned anywhere on Kent's Website or User Manual but by the looks of it, it does feel like a Stainless Steel Chamber (Do ask the Installation Guy or the Customer Service for the same). This was my Overall Experience for now and I opted than any other brand only because of that 3 years Extended AMC they are offering as opposed to their rivals. Thank You.

  The package was opened by KENT service person and he found that UF Membrane cartridge is broken and bypassed the connection.  Also he discouraged online purchase.  Instead of returning, he suggested to lodge a request via KENT Service App.  But it displays that my phone number is not updated.  At the same time it dispalys my  mobile number and address.  If the company do not replace the item, I have to return the unit for replacement

  Packaging was good.Water tastes good.Better than the previous version in terms of design.Installation was done in a timely manner.Storage indicator available but has no light.Required to buy the extra side filter and the cover for the Kent filter.Power consumption is less and purified water is 1 ltr for 2 ltr tap water.

  I recommend don't buy........1 - fake 1 year warranty and 3 year service free .After installation make abnormal sound and highly vibration in Kent RO inner parts ,After many times requested to customer Care no help and no response. Only say \"aapki Puri Shayta ki jayegi ,\"I requested to kent from Kent service app and also from customer Care number but after more then 15 days no service provided .2- price very very high ( same features) then other company and no quality and worst customer Care.3- Kent no free installation, if you call for installation then service person say you must buy prefilter from us and gives price 950 rupye extra. My prefilter buy from Amazon with KENR RO because prefilter recommendation by amazon, service person say you pay 300 rupye extra for your prefilter instaillation and no warranty provide KENT, if you Installation your prefilter ( I call customer care but no more help from Kent service center).4- don't go in brand name and high price because not always right,  brand name and high price.

  The installation request was raised on 16th Dec., however, no one has come to install it, that too even after calling customer care of kent 2-3 times. They assign the installation to one technician, who first told that he can come only between 10:30 AM to 1 PM, which did not match with my office hours, so i requested him to come earlier or in the evening, he didnt agree. I again contacted Kent customer care on Saturday (21 dec.) and requested them to schedule installation at the earliest, they scheduled installation at 3:30 PM same day, however, assigned the installation to the very same person who had been assigned earlier, and as usual he never came. I contacted kent customer care again on Sunday, however, of no use. It has become so difficult to get it installed, had i known it i would have never bought it

  Not filtering properly. Filtered water is containing white thread like particles. No support from customer care side. They are not replacing the faulty parts. Service center technician and owner and Kent Area sales manager all have seen the problem by home visit telling lie to the kent and denying to replace the part . They want me to do Lab test report for the water to get the part replaced.Very BAD SUPPORT from KENT. They don't want to replace the part becoz it is under warranty.NEVER BUY ANYTHING FROM KENT. THEY WILL NOT CHANGE THE PART BECAUSE IT IS UNDER WARRANTY. they will change the parts only when u give them money.

  I used this product from yesterday, so not to put any comments regarding the quality. Delivered on time by ATS, thanks for Amazon but I faced issues whenever I installed the product. After two days later technician came & tell me for purchasing Prefilter (Sediment Filter) which cost is  1650/ & also tell me if I not purchased the Pre-filter he back without installing the product. So I contact the Kent customer service & tell all the issues. After called the helpline I knew the actual price of Prefilter..700/. Nothing happens after lots of conference calld between Kent executive, local dealer & me. Me & my family members was frastete from the brand KENT. As per telephonic discussion with help line they arranged a senior manager call within two hours but write now I am not received any call from KENT HELP LINE CENTRE. Later I feel...this all  things out of my control so I paid 1650 & installed the product. My Local Dealer Name & contact details - GOUTAM PYNE, BANKURA, 8250950073, PIN- 722101, West Bengal.

  Would have given zero rating if it was possible, i have been a kent customer for years and over the years kents service and product has come down to a such low that its useless, feel cheated after buying this product, my advice do not go for kent products and check for alternatives,The installation is supposedly free, but the service engineer will always push for a pre-filter, this was usual and i have experienced this before so i was ok with it, but now these guys have come up with a new concept of pressure reducing valve and says this avoids the purifier from bursting in case of high pressure and also avoids air getting in, now both of these components seems reasonable and cannot be avoided then why is this not provided by default with the purifier as these are part of safety.All this is not even start, the machine i recieved had wrong internal connection of water flow (not sure wether it was wrong or the installation guy had poor knowledge) so he had to correct it, this shocked me as a purifier which is factory assembled and passed their quality and testing check should not ideally have wrong connection.After all this circus the purifier have started leaking water even after the purifier was powered down, and now i have shut the water line to the purifier so that i can avoid flooding of my apartment, and have come to a realization the poor water taste i was facing was because the water was never getting purified and it was just passing through as is.Now this is a clear case of defective product but kent does not have any return or replacement they can only service and i have to hope that they would fix it.

  I Purchased this Product on July 9, 2020, at around 7 pm and it was delivered on July 12, 2020, around 2 pm. I requested for the Installation as soon as receiving the Product and the Service Guy came within an Hour after calling me for the address info. The purifier was Installed on the same day even though 12th July being a Sunday. I would urge others to request for the Installation and not wait for the Brand to call back as it may take time as they offer service according to the Queue. Also, Speed of Installation or Service may take time as per the Service Provider Availability. In my case, the Installation Work was given to their Authorised Service Centre in my area. The Service Guy himself did everything on his own and the Overall Experience was Satisfactory. He asked me for the Prefilter on the call before coming and told me the price to be 700 ( which may vary with Service Provider) which I agreed. After the installation, he said he changed the Inline Sediment Filter as it was defective but being in warranty it won't cost me a buck. He also asked me for my preferred TDS Level and he suggested to set it at 80. One thing to note is that the TDS level can only be set by the Service Guy with the help of a screw and there's no knob or button available to the end-user. Another thing he told me is that the Warranty for the Sediment and Carbon Filters is 6 months and for other filters and Parts is 1 year, In that period, the Respective Parts will be changed free of cost by the Service Guy himself. After the One Year, Only Service will be Free (Visiting and Maintenance Charges) but the Filters or any other parts have to bear by the Consumer (500-1000 for filters and 2500 for water pump). He also suggested changing the Prefilter every 3 months which will cost around 100-200. For other filters, it may vary according to the Water Consumption and the Water Quality of the Source. Although filters should be changed at least once a year. One Important thing to note before buying this particular product which I completely missed is that Kent New Grand doesn't come with a UV lamp inside Storage Tank, whereas it is present in the Newer Model Kent New Grand Plus. I would highly recommend going for that Model as it is only 1000 rupees (at max) more than this one but the extra UV lamp does ensure there are no bacterias present in the Storage Tank itself after all the Purification has been done ( It comes with a 9L tank as compared to 8L).

  The installation request was raised on 16th Dec., however, no one has come to install it, that too even after calling customer care of kent 2-3 times. They assign the installation to one technician, who first told that he can come only between 10:30 AM to 1 PM, which did not match with my office hours, so i requested him to come earlier or in the evening, he didnt agree. I again contacted Kent customer care on Saturday (21 dec.) and requested them to schedule installation at the earliest, they scheduled installation at 3:30 PM same day, however, assigned the installation to the very same person who had been assigned earlier, and as usual he never came. I contacted kent customer care again on Sunday, however, of no use. It has become so difficult to get it installed, had i known it i would have never bought it

  Not filtering properly. Filtered water is containing white thread like particles. No support from customer care side. They are not replacing the faulty parts. Service center technician and owner and Kent Area sales manager all have seen the problem by home visit telling lie to the kent and denying to replace the part . They want me to do Lab test report for the water to get the part replaced.Very BAD SUPPORT from KENT. They don't want to replace the part becoz it is under warranty.NEVER BUY ANYTHING FROM KENT. THEY WILL NOT CHANGE THE PART BECAUSE IT IS UNDER WARRANTY. they will change the parts only when u give them money.

  I used this product from yesterday, so not to put any comments regarding the quality. Delivered on time by ATS, thanks for Amazon but I faced issues whenever I installed the product. After two days later technician came & tell me for purchasing Prefilter (Sediment Filter) which cost is  1650/ & also tell me if I not purchased the Pre-filter he back without installing the product. So I contact the Kent customer service & tell all the issues. After called the helpline I knew the actual price of Prefilter..700/. Nothing happens after lots of conference calld between Kent executive, local dealer & me. Me & my family members was frastete from the brand KENT. As per telephonic discussion with help line they arranged a senior manager call within two hours but write now I am not received any call from KENT HELP LINE CENTRE. Later I feel...this all  things out of my control so I paid 1650 & installed the product. My Local Dealer Name & contact details - GOUTAM PYNE, BANKURA, 8250950073, PIN- 722101, West Bengal.

  Would have given zero rating if it was possible, i have been a kent customer for years and over the years kents service and product has come down to a such low that its useless, feel cheated after buying this product, my advice do not go for kent products and check for alternatives,The installation is supposedly free, but the service engineer will always push for a pre-filter, this was usual and i have experienced this before so i was ok with it, but now these guys have come up with a new concept of pressure reducing valve and says this avoids the purifier from bursting in case of high pressure and also avoids air getting in, now both of these components seems reasonable and cannot be avoided then why is this not provided by default with the purifier as these are part of safety.All this is not even start, the machine i recieved had wrong internal connection of water flow (not sure wether it was wrong or the installation guy had poor knowledge) so he had to correct it, this shocked me as a purifier which is factory assembled and passed their quality and testing check should not ideally have wrong connection.After all this circus the purifier have started leaking water even after the purifier was powered down, and now i have shut the water line to the purifier so that i can avoid flooding of my apartment, and have come to a realization the poor water taste i was facing was because the water was never getting purified and it was just passing through as is.Now this is a clear case of defective product but kent does not have any return or replacement they can only service and i have to hope that they would fix it.

  I Purchased this Product on July 9, 2020, at around 7 pm and it was delivered on July 12, 2020, around 2 pm. I requested for the Installation as soon as receiving the Product and the Service Guy came within an Hour after calling me for the address info. The purifier was Installed on the same day even though 12th July being a Sunday. I would urge others to request for the Installation and not wait for the Brand to call back as it may take time as they offer service according to the Queue. Also, Speed of Installation or Service may take time as per the Service Provider Availability. In my case, the Installation Work was given to their Authorised Service Centre in my area. The Service Guy himself did everything on his own and the Overall Experience was Satisfactory. He asked me for the Prefilter on the call before coming and told me the price to be 700 ( which may vary with Service Provider) which I agreed. After the installation, he said he changed the Inline Sediment Filter as it was defective but being in warranty it won't cost me a buck. He also asked me for my preferred TDS Level and he suggested to set it at 80. One thing to note is that the TDS level can only be set by the Service Guy with the help of a screw and there's no knob or button available to the end-user. Another thing he told me is that the Warranty for the Sediment and Carbon Filters is 6 months and for other filters and Parts is 1 year, In that period, the Respective Parts will be changed free of cost by the Service Guy himself. After the One Year, Only Service will be Free (Visiting and Maintenance Charges) but the Filters or any other parts have to bear by the Consumer (500-1000 for filters and 2500 for water pump). He also suggested changing the Prefilter every 3 months which will cost around 100-200. For other filters, it may vary according to the Water Consumption and the Water Quality of the Source. Although filters should be changed at least once a year. One Important thing to note before buying this particular product which I completely missed is that Kent New Grand doesn't come with a UV lamp inside Storage Tank, whereas it is present in the Newer Model Kent New Grand Plus. I would highly recommend going for that Model as it is only 1000 rupees (at max) more than this one but the extra UV lamp does ensure there are no bacterias present in the Storage Tank itself after all the Purification has been done ( It comes with a 9L tank as compared to 8L). It has all the same features as this one with that extra feature. As for the UV Lamp, it is not mentioned anywhere on Kent's Website or User Manual but by the looks of it, it does feel like a Stainless Steel Chamber (Do ask the Installation Guy or the Customer Service for the same). This was my Overall Experience for now and I opted than any other brand only because of that 3 years Extended AMC they are offering as opposed to their rivals. Thank You.

  The package was opened by KENT service person and he found that UF Membrane cartridge is broken and bypassed the connection.  Also he discouraged online purchase.  Instead of returning, he suggested to lodge a request via KENT Service App.  But it displays that my phone number is not updated.  At the same time it dispalys my  mobile number and address.  If the company do not replace the item, I have to return the unit for replacement

  Packaging was good.Water tastes good.Better than the previous version in terms of design.Installation was done in a timely manner.Storage indicator available but has no light.Required to buy the extra side filter and the cover for the Kent filter.Power consumption is less and purified water is 1 ltr for 2 ltr tap water.

  I recommend don't buy........1 - fake 1 year warranty and 3 year service free .After installation make abnormal sound and highly vibration in Kent RO inner parts ,After many times requested to customer Care no help and no response. Only say \"aapki Puri Shayta ki jayegi ,\"I requested to kent from Kent service app and also from customer Care number but after more then 15 days no service provided .2- price very very high ( same features) then other company and no quality and worst customer Care.3- Kent no free installation, if you call for installation then service person say you must buy prefilter from us and gives price 950 rupye extra. My prefilter buy from Amazon with KENR RO because prefilter recommendation by amazon, service person say you pay 300 rupye extra for your prefilter instaillation and no warranty provide KENT, if you Installation your prefilter ( I call customer care but no more help from Kent service center).4- don't go in brand name and high price because not always right,  brand name and high price.

  Would have given zero rating if it was possible, i have been a kent customer for years and over the years kents service and product has come down to a such low that its useless, feel cheated after buying this product, my advice do not go for kent products and check for alternatives,The installation is supposedly free, but the service engineer will always push for a pre-filter, this was usual and i have experienced this before so i was ok with it, but now these guys have come up with a new concept of pressure reducing valve and says this avoids the purifier from bursting in case of high pressure and also avoids air getting in, now both of these components seems reasonable and cannot be avoided then why is this not provided by default with the purifier as these are part of safety.All this is not even start, the machine i recieved had wrong internal connection of water flow (not sure wether it was wrong or the installation guy had poor knowledge) so he had to correct it, this shocked me as a purifier which is factory assembled and passed their quality and testing check should not ideally have wrong connection.After all this circus the purifier have started leaking water even after the purifier was powered down, and now i have shut the water line to the purifier so that i can avoid flooding of my apartment, and have come to a realization the poor water taste i was facing was because the water was never getting purified and it was just passing through as is.Now this is a clear case of defective product but kent does not have any return or replacement they can only service and i have to hope that they would fix it.

  I Purchased this Product on July 9, 2020, at around 7 pm and it was delivered on July 12, 2020, around 2 pm. I requested for the Installation as soon as receiving the Product and the Service Guy came within an Hour after calling me for the address info. The purifier was Installed on the same day even though 12th July being a Sunday. I would urge others to request for the Installation and not wait for the Brand to call back as it may take time as they offer service according to the Queue. Also, Speed of Installation or Service may take time as per the Service Provider Availability. In my case, the Installation Work was given to their Authorised Service Centre in my area. The Service Guy himself did everything on his own and the Overall Experience was Satisfactory. He asked me for the Prefilter on the call before coming and told me the price to be 700 ( which may vary with Service Provider) which I agreed. After the installation, he said he changed the Inline Sediment Filter as it was defective but being in warranty it won't cost me a buck. He also asked me for my preferred TDS Level and he suggested to set it at 80. One thing to note is that the TDS level can only be set by the Service Guy with the help of a screw and there's no knob or button available to the end-user. Another thing he told me is that the Warranty for the Sediment and Carbon Filters is 6 months and for other filters and Parts is 1 year, In that period, the Respective Parts will be changed free of cost by the Service Guy himself. After the One Year, Only Service will be Free (Visiting and Maintenance Charges) but the Filters or any other parts have to bear by the Consumer (500-1000 for filters and 2500 for water pump). He also suggested changing the Prefilter every 3 months which will cost around 100-200. For other filters, it may vary according to the Water Consumption and the Water Quality of the Source. Although filters should be changed at least once a year. One Important thing to note before buying this particular product which I completely missed is that Kent New Grand doesn't come with a UV lamp inside Storage Tank, whereas it is present in the Newer Model Kent New Grand Plus. I would highly recommend going for that Model as it is only 1000 rupees (at max) more than this one but the extra UV lamp does ensure there are no bacterias present in the Storage Tank itself after all the Purification has been done ( It comes with a 9L tank as compared to 8L). It has all the same features as this one with that extra feature. As for the UV Lamp, it is not mentioned anywhere on Kent's Website or User Manual but by the looks of it, it does feel like a Stainless Steel Chamber (Do ask the Installation Guy or the Customer Service for the same). This was my Overall Experience for now and I opted than any other brand only because of that 3 years Extended AMC they are offering as opposed to their rivals. Thank You.

  The package was opened by KENT service person and he found that UF Membrane cartridge is broken and bypassed the connection.  Also he discouraged online purchase.  Instead of returning, he suggested to lodge a request via KENT Service App.  But it displays that my phone number is not updated.  At the same time it dispalys my  mobile number and address.  If the company do not replace the item, I have to return the unit for replacement

  Packaging was good.Water tastes good.Better than the previous version in terms of design.Installation was done in a timely manner.Storage indicator available but has no light.Required to buy the extra side filter and the cover for the Kent filter.Power consumption is less and purified water is 1 ltr for 2 ltr tap water.

  I recommend don't buy........1 - fake 1 year warranty and 3 year service free .After installation make abnormal sound and highly vibration in Kent RO inner parts ,After many times requested to customer Care no help and no response. Only say \"aapki Puri Shayta ki jayegi ,\"I requested to kent from Kent service app and also from customer Care number but after more then 15 days no service provided .2- price very very high ( same features) then other company and no quality and worst customer Care.3- Kent no free installation, if you call for installation then service person say you must buy prefilter from us and gives price 950 rupye extra. My prefilter buy from Amazon with KENR RO because prefilter recommendation by amazon, service person say you pay 300 rupye extra for your prefilter instaillation and no warranty provide KENT, if you Installation your prefilter ( I call customer care but no more help from Kent service center).4- don't go in brand name and high price because not always right,  brand name and high price.

  The installation request was raised on 16th Dec., however, no one has come to install it, that too even after calling customer care of kent 2-3 times. They assign the installation to one technician, who first told that he can come only between 10:30 AM to 1 PM, which did not match with my office hours, so i requested him to come earlier or in the evening, he didnt agree. I again contacted Kent customer care on Saturday (21 dec.) and requested them to schedule installation at the earliest, they scheduled installation at 3:30 PM same day, however, assigned the installation to the very same person who had been assigned earlier, and as usual he never came. I contacted kent customer care again on Sunday, however, of no use. It has become so difficult to get it installed, had i known it i would have never bought it

  Not filtering properly. Filtered water is containing white thread like particles. No support from customer care side. They are not replacing the faulty parts. Service center technician and owner and Kent Area sales manager all have seen the problem by home visit telling lie to the kent and denying to replace the part . They want me to do Lab test report for the water to get the part replaced.Very BAD SUPPORT from KENT. They don't want to replace the part becoz it is under warranty.NEVER BUY ANYTHING FROM KENT. THEY WILL NOT CHANGE THE PART BECAUSE IT IS UNDER WARRANTY. they will change the parts only when u give them money.

  I used this product from yesterday, so not to put any comments regarding the quality. Delivered on time by ATS, thanks for Amazon but I faced issues whenever I installed the product. After two days later technician came & tell me for purchasing Prefilter (Sediment Filter) which cost is  1650/ & also tell me if I not purchased the Pre-filter he back without installing the product. So I contact the Kent customer service & tell all the issues. After called the helpline I knew the actual price of Prefilter..700/. Nothing happens after lots of conference calld between Kent executive, local dealer & me. Me & my family members was frastete from the brand KENT. As per telephonic discussion with help line they arranged a senior manager call within two hours but write now I am not received any call from KENT HELP LINE CENTRE. Later I feel...this all  things out of my control so I paid 1650 & installed the product. My Local Dealer Name & contact details - GOUTAM PYNE, BANKURA, 8250950073, PIN- 722101, West Bengal.

It has all the same features as this one with that extra feature. As for the UV Lamp, it is not mentioned anywhere on Kent's Website or User Manual but by the looks of it, it does feel like a Stainless Steel Chamber (Do ask the Installation Guy or the Customer Service for the same). This was my Overall Experience for now and I opted than any other brand only because of that 3 years Extended AMC they are offering as opposed to their rivals. Thank You.

  The package was opened by KENT service person and he found that UF Membrane cartridge is broken and bypassed the connection.  Also he discouraged online purchase.  Instead of returning, he suggested to lodge a request via KENT Service App.  But it displays that my phone number is not updated.  At the same time it dispalys my  mobile number and address.  If the company do not replace the item, I have to return the unit for replacement

  Packaging was good.Water tastes good.Better than the previous version in terms of design.Installation was done in a timely manner.Storage indicator available but has no light.Required to buy the extra side filter and the cover for the Kent filter.Power consumption is less and purified water is 1 ltr for 2 ltr tap water.

  I recommend don't buy........1 - fake 1 year warranty and 3 year service free .After installation make abnormal sound and highly vibration in Kent RO inner parts ,After many times requested to customer Care no help and no response. Only say \"aapki Puri Shayta ki jayegi ,\"I requested to kent from Kent service app and also from customer Care number but after more then 15 days no service provided .2- price very very high ( same features) then other company and no quality and worst customer Care.3- Kent no free installation, if you call for installation then service person say you must buy prefilter from us and gives price 950 rupye extra. My prefilter buy from Amazon with KENR RO because prefilter recommendation by amazon, service person say you pay 300 rupye extra for your prefilter instaillation and no warranty provide KENT, if you Installation your prefilter ( I call customer care but no more help from Kent service center).4- don't go in brand name and high price because not always right,  brand name and high price.

  The installation request was raised on 16th Dec., however, no one has come to install it, that too even after calling customer care of kent 2-3 times. They assign the installation to one technician, who first told that he can come only between 10:30 AM to 1 PM, which did not match with my office hours, so i requested him to come earlier or in the evening, he didnt agree. I again contacted Kent customer care on Saturday (21 dec.) and requested them to schedule installation at the earliest, they scheduled installation at 3:30 PM same day, however, assigned the installation to the very same person who had been assigned earlier, and as usual he never came. I contacted kent customer care again on Sunday, however, of no use. It has become so difficult to get it installed, had i known it i would have never bought it

  Not filtering properly. Filtered water is containing white thread like particles. No support from customer care side. They are not replacing the faulty parts. Service center technician and owner and Kent Area sales manager all have seen the problem by home visit telling lie to the kent and denying to replace the part . They want me to do Lab test report for the water to get the part replaced.Very BAD SUPPORT from KENT. They don't want to replace the part becoz it is under warranty.NEVER BUY ANYTHING FROM KENT. THEY WILL NOT CHANGE THE PART BECAUSE IT IS UNDER WARRANTY. they will change the parts only when u give them money.

  I used this product from yesterday, so not to put any comments regarding the quality. Delivered on time by ATS, thanks for Amazon but I faced issues whenever I installed the product. After two days later technician came & tell me for purchasing Prefilter (Sediment Filter) which cost is  1650/ & also tell me if I not purchased the Pre-filter he back without installing the product. So I contact the Kent customer service & tell all the issues. After called the helpline I knew the actual price of Prefilter..700/. Nothing happens after lots of conference calld between Kent executive, local dealer & me. Me & my family members was frastete from the brand KENT. As per telephonic discussion with help line they arranged a senior manager call within two hours but write now I am not received any call from KENT HELP LINE CENTRE. Later I feel...this all  things out of my control so I paid 1650 & installed the product. My Local Dealer Name & contact details - GOUTAM PYNE, BANKURA, 8250950073, PIN- 722101, West Bengal.

  Would have given zero rating if it was possible, i have been a kent customer for years and over the years kents service and product has come down to a such low that its useless, feel cheated after buying this product, my advice do not go for kent products and check for alternatives,The installation is supposedly free, but the service engineer will always push for a pre-filter, this was usual and i have experienced this before so i was ok with it, but now these guys have come up with a new concept of pressure reducing valve and says this avoids the purifier from bursting in case of high pressure and also avoids air getting in, now both of these components seems reasonable and cannot be avoided then why is this not provided by default with the purifier as these are part of safety.All this is not even start, the machine i recieved had wrong internal connection of water flow (not sure wether it was wrong or the installation guy had poor knowledge) so he had to correct it, this shocked me as a purifier which is factory assembled and passed their quality and testing check should not ideally have wrong connection.After all this circus the purifier have started leaking water even after the purifier was powered down, and now i have shut the water line to the purifier so that i can avoid flooding of my apartment, and have come to a realization the poor water taste i was facing was because the water was never getting purified and it was just passing through as is.Now this is a clear case of defective product but kent does not have any return or replacement they can only service and i have to hope that they would fix it.

  I Purchased this Product on July 9, 2020, at around 7 pm and it was delivered on July 12, 2020, around 2 pm. I requested for the Installation as soon as receiving the Product and the Service Guy came within an Hour after calling me for the address info. The purifier was Installed on the same day even though 12th July being a Sunday. I would urge others to request for the Installation and not wait for the Brand to call back as it may take time as they offer service according to the Queue. Also, Speed of Installation or Service may take time as per the Service Provider Availability. In my case, the Installation Work was given to their Authorised Service Centre in my area. The Service Guy himself did everything on his own and the Overall Experience was Satisfactory. He asked me for the Prefilter on the call before coming and told me the price to be 700 ( which may vary with Service Provider) which I agreed. After the installation, he said he changed the Inline Sediment Filter as it was defective but being in warranty it won't cost me a buck. He also asked me for my preferred TDS Level and he suggested to set it at 80. One thing to note is that the TDS level can only be set by the Service Guy with the help of a screw and there's no knob or button available to the end-user. Another thing he told me is that the Warranty for the Sediment and Carbon Filters is 6 months and for other filters and Parts is 1 year, In that period, the Respective Parts will be changed free of cost by the Service Guy himself. After the One Year, Only Service will be Free (Visiting and Maintenance Charges) but the Filters or any other parts have to bear by the Consumer (500-1000 for filters and 2500 for water pump). He also suggested changing the Prefilter every 3 months which will cost around 100-200. For other filters, it may vary according to the Water Consumption and the Water Quality of the Source. Although filters should be changed at least once a year. One Important thing to note before buying this particular product which I completely missed is that Kent New Grand doesn't come with a UV lamp inside Storage Tank, whereas it is present in the Newer Model Kent New Grand Plus. I would highly recommend going for that Model as it is only 1000 rupees (at max) more than this one but the extra UV lamp does ensure there are no bacterias present in the Storage Tank itself after all the Purification has been done ( It comes with a 9L tank as compared to 8L).

  The installation request was raised on 16th Dec., however, no one has come to install it, that too even after calling customer care of kent 2-3 times. They assign the installation to one technician, who first told that he can come only between 10:30 AM to 1 PM, which did not match with my office hours, so i requested him to come earlier or in the evening, he didnt agree. I again contacted Kent customer care on Saturday (21 dec.) and requested them to schedule installation at the earliest, they scheduled installation at 3:30 PM same day, however, assigned the installation to the very same person who had been assigned earlier, and as usual he never came. I contacted kent customer care again on Sunday, however, of no use. It has become so difficult to get it installed, had i known it i would have never bought it

  Not filtering properly. Filtered water is containing white thread like particles. No support from customer care side. They are not replacing the faulty parts. Service center technician and owner and Kent Area sales manager all have seen the problem by home visit telling lie to the kent and denying to replace the part . They want me to do Lab test report for the water to get the part replaced.Very BAD SUPPORT from KENT. They don't want to replace the part becoz it is under warranty.NEVER BUY ANYTHING FROM KENT. THEY WILL NOT CHANGE THE PART BECAUSE IT IS UNDER WARRANTY. they will change the parts only when u give them money.

  I used this product from yesterday, so not to put any comments regarding the quality. Delivered on time by ATS, thanks for Amazon but I faced issues whenever I installed the product. After two days later technician came & tell me for purchasing Prefilter (Sediment Filter) which cost is  1650/ & also tell me if I not purchased the Pre-filter he back without installing the product. So I contact the Kent customer service & tell all the issues. After called the helpline I knew the actual price of Prefilter..700/. Nothing happens after lots of conference calld between Kent executive, local dealer & me. Me & my family members was frastete from the brand KENT. As per telephonic discussion with help line they arranged a senior manager call within two hours but write now I am not received any call from KENT HELP LINE CENTRE. Later I feel...this all  things out of my control so I paid 1650 & installed the product. My Local Dealer Name & contact details - GOUTAM PYNE, BANKURA, 8250950073, PIN- 722101, West Bengal.

  Would have given zero rating if it was possible, i have been a kent customer for years and over the years kents service and product has come down to a such low that its useless, feel cheated after buying this product, my advice do not go for kent products and check for alternatives,The installation is supposedly free, but the service engineer will always push for a pre-filter, this was usual and i have experienced this before so i was ok with it, but now these guys have come up with a new concept of pressure reducing valve and says this avoids the purifier from bursting in case of high pressure and also avoids air getting in, now both of these components seems reasonable and cannot be avoided then why is this not provided by default with the purifier as these are part of safety.All this is not even start, the machine i recieved had wrong internal connection of water flow (not sure wether it was wrong or the installation guy had poor knowledge) so he had to correct it, this shocked me as a purifier which is factory assembled and passed their quality and testing check should not ideally have wrong connection.After all this circus the purifier have started leaking water even after the purifier was powered down, and now i have shut the water line to the purifier so that i can avoid flooding of my apartment, and have come to a realization the poor water taste i was facing was because the water was never getting purified and it was just passing through as is.Now this is a clear case of defective product but kent does not have any return or replacement they can only service and i have to hope that they would fix it.

  I Purchased this Product on July 9, 2020, at around 7 pm and it was delivered on July 12, 2020, around 2 pm. I requested for the Installation as soon as receiving the Product and the Service Guy came within an Hour after calling me for the address info. The purifier was Installed on the same day even though 12th July being a Sunday. I would urge others to request for the Installation and not wait for the Brand to call back as it may take time as they offer service according to the Queue. Also, Speed of Installation or Service may take time as per the Service Provider Availability. In my case, the Installation Work was given to their Authorised Service Centre in my area. The Service Guy himself did everything on his own and the Overall Experience was Satisfactory. He asked me for the Prefilter on the call before coming and told me the price to be 700 ( which may vary with Service Provider) which I agreed. After the installation, he said he changed the Inline Sediment Filter as it was defective but being in warranty it won't cost me a buck. He also asked me for my preferred TDS Level and he suggested to set it at 80. One thing to note is that the TDS level can only be set by the Service Guy with the help of a screw and there's no knob or button available to the end-user. Another thing he told me is that the Warranty for the Sediment and Carbon Filters is 6 months and for other filters and Parts is 1 year, In that period, the Respective Parts will be changed free of cost by the Service Guy himself. After the One Year, Only Service will be Free (Visiting and Maintenance Charges) but the Filters or any other parts have to bear by the Consumer (500-1000 for filters and 2500 for water pump). He also suggested changing the Prefilter every 3 months which will cost around 100-200. For other filters, it may vary according to the Water Consumption and the Water Quality of the Source. Although filters should be changed at least once a year. One Important thing to note before buying this particular product which I completely missed is that Kent New Grand doesn't come with a UV lamp inside Storage Tank, whereas it is present in the Newer Model Kent New Grand Plus. I would highly recommend going for that Model as it is only 1000 rupees (at max) more than this one but the extra UV lamp does ensure there are no bacterias present in the Storage Tank itself after all the Purification has been done ( It comes with a 9L tank as compared to 8L). It has all the same features as this one with that extra feature. As for the UV Lamp, it is not mentioned anywhere on Kent's Website or User Manual but by the looks of it, it does feel like a Stainless Steel Chamber (Do ask the Installation Guy or the Customer Service for the same). This was my Overall Experience for now and I opted than any other brand only because of that 3 years Extended AMC they are offering as opposed to their rivals. Thank You.

  The package was opened by KENT service person and he found that UF Membrane cartridge is broken and bypassed the connection.  Also he discouraged online purchase.  Instead of returning, he suggested to lodge a request via KENT Service App.  But it displays that my phone number is not updated.  At the same time it dispalys my  mobile number and address.  If the company do not replace the item, I have to return the unit for replacement

  Packaging was good.Water tastes good.Better than the previous version in terms of design.Installation was done in a timely manner.Storage indicator available but has no light.Required to buy the extra side filter and the cover for the Kent filter.Power consumption is less and purified water is 1 ltr for 2 ltr tap water.

  I recommend don't buy........1 - fake 1 year warranty and 3 year service free .After installation make abnormal sound and highly vibration in Kent RO inner parts ,After many times requested to customer Care no help and no response. Only say \"aapki Puri Shayta ki jayegi ,\"I requested to kent from Kent service app and also from customer Care number but after more then 15 days no service provided .2- price very very high ( same features) then other company and no quality and worst customer Care.3- Kent no free installation, if you call for installation then service person say you must buy prefilter from us and gives price 950 rupye extra. My prefilter buy from Amazon with KENR RO because prefilter recommendation by amazon, service person say you pay 300 rupye extra for your prefilter instaillation and no warranty provide KENT, if you Installation your prefilter ( I call customer care but no more help from Kent service center).4- don't go in brand name and high price because not always right,  brand name and high price.

  Would have given zero rating if it was possible, i have been a kent customer for years and over the years kents service and product has come down to a such low that its useless, feel cheated after buying this product, my advice do not go for kent products and check for alternatives,The installation is supposedly free, but the service engineer will always push for a pre-filter, this was usual and i have experienced this before so i was ok with it, but now these guys have come up with a new concept of pressure reducing valve and says this avoids the purifier from bursting in case of high pressure and also avoids air getting in, now both of these components seems reasonable and cannot be avoided then why is this not provided by default with the purifier as these are part of safety.All this is not even start, the machine i recieved had wrong internal connection of water flow (not sure wether it was wrong or the installation guy had poor knowledge) so he had to correct it, this shocked me as a purifier which is factory assembled and passed their quality and testing check should not ideally have wrong connection.After all this circus the purifier have started leaking water even after the purifier was powered down, and now i have shut the water line to the purifier so that i can avoid flooding of my apartment, and have come to a realization the poor water taste i was facing was because the water was never getting purified and it was just passing through as is.Now this is a clear case of defective product but kent does not have any return or replacement they can only service and i have to hope that they would fix it.

  I Purchased this Product on July 9, 2020, at around 7 pm and it was delivered on July 12, 2020, around 2 pm. I requested for the Installation as soon as receiving the Product and the Service Guy came within an Hour after calling me for the address info. The purifier was Installed on the same day even though 12th July being a Sunday. I would urge others to request for the Installation and not wait for the Brand to call back as it may take time as they offer service according to the Queue. Also, Speed of Installation or Service may take time as per the Service Provider Availability. In my case, the Installation Work was given to their Authorised Service Centre in my area. The Service Guy himself did everything on his own and the Overall Experience was Satisfactory. He asked me for the Prefilter on the call before coming and told me the price to be 700 ( which may vary with Service Provider) which I agreed. After the installation, he said he changed the Inline Sediment Filter as it was defective but being in warranty it won't cost me a buck. He also asked me for my preferred TDS Level and he suggested to set it at 80. One thing to note is that the TDS level can only be set by the Service Guy with the help of a screw and there's no knob or button available to the end-user. Another thing he told me is that the Warranty for the Sediment and Carbon Filters is 6 months and for other filters and Parts is 1 year, In that period, the Respective Parts will be changed free of cost by the Service Guy himself. After the One Year, Only Service will be Free (Visiting and Maintenance Charges) but the Filters or any other parts have to bear by the Consumer (500-1000 for filters and 2500 for water pump). He also suggested changing the Prefilter every 3 months which will cost around 100-200. For other filters, it may vary according to the Water Consumption and the Water Quality of the Source. Although filters should be changed at least once a year. One Important thing to note before buying this particular product which I completely missed is that Kent New Grand doesn't come with a UV lamp inside Storage Tank, whereas it is present in the Newer Model Kent New Grand Plus. I would highly recommend going for that Model as it is only 1000 rupees (at max) more than this one but the extra UV lamp does ensure there are no bacterias present in the Storage Tank itself after all the Purification has been done ( It comes with a 9L tank as compared to 8L). It has all the same features as this one with that extra feature. As for the UV Lamp, it is not mentioned anywhere on Kent's Website or User Manual but by the looks of it, it does feel like a Stainless Steel Chamber (Do ask the Installation Guy or the Customer Service for the same). This was my Overall Experience for now and I opted than any other brand only because of that 3 years Extended AMC they are offering as opposed to their rivals. Thank You.

  The package was opened by KENT service person and he found that UF Membrane cartridge is broken and bypassed the connection.  Also he discouraged online purchase.  Instead of returning, he suggested to lodge a request via KENT Service App.  But it displays that my phone number is not updated.  At the same time it dispalys my  mobile number and address.  If the company do not replace the item, I have to return the unit for replacement

  Packaging was good.Water tastes good.Better than the previous version in terms of design.Installation was done in a timely manner.Storage indicator available but has no light.Required to buy the extra side filter and the cover for the Kent filter.Power consumption is less and purified water is 1 ltr for 2 ltr tap water.

  I recommend don't buy........1 - fake 1 year warranty and 3 year service free .After installation make abnormal sound and highly vibration in Kent RO inner parts ,After many times requested to customer Care no help and no response. Only say \"aapki Puri Shayta ki jayegi ,\"I requested to kent from Kent service app and also from customer Care number but after more then 15 days no service provided .2- price very very high ( same features) then other company and no quality and worst customer Care.3- Kent no free installation, if you call for installation then service person say you must buy prefilter from us and gives price 950 rupye extra. My prefilter buy from Amazon with KENR RO because prefilter recommendation by amazon, service person say you pay 300 rupye extra for your prefilter instaillation and no warranty provide KENT, if you Installation your prefilter ( I call customer care but no more help from Kent service center).4- don't go in brand name and high price because not always right,  brand name and high price.

  The installation request was raised on 16th Dec., however, no one has come to install it, that too even after calling customer care of kent 2-3 times. They assign the installation to one technician, who first told that he can come only between 10:30 AM to 1 PM, which did not match with my office hours, so i requested him to come earlier or in the evening, he didnt agree. I again contacted Kent customer care on Saturday (21 dec.) and requested them to schedule installation at the earliest, they scheduled installation at 3:30 PM same day, however, assigned the installation to the very same person who had been assigned earlier, and as usual he never came. I contacted kent customer care again on Sunday, however, of no use. It has become so difficult to get it installed, had i known it i would have never bought it

  Not filtering properly. Filtered water is containing white thread like particles. No support from customer care side. They are not replacing the faulty parts. Service center technician and owner and Kent Area sales manager all have seen the problem by home visit telling lie to the kent and denying to replace the part . They want me to do Lab test report for the water to get the part replaced.Very BAD SUPPORT from KENT. They don't want to replace the part becoz it is under warranty.NEVER BUY ANYTHING FROM KENT. THEY WILL NOT CHANGE THE PART BECAUSE IT IS UNDER WARRANTY. they will change the parts only when u give them money.

  I used this product from yesterday, so not to put any comments regarding the quality. Delivered on time by ATS, thanks for Amazon but I faced issues whenever I installed the product. After two days later technician came & tell me for purchasing Prefilter (Sediment Filter) which cost is  1650/ & also tell me if I not purchased the Pre-filter he back without installing the product. So I contact the Kent customer service & tell all the issues. After called the helpline I knew the actual price of Prefilter..700/. Nothing happens after lots of conference calld between Kent executive, local dealer & me. Me & my family members was frastete from the brand KENT. As per telephonic discussion with help line they arranged a senior manager call within two hours but write now I am not received any call from KENT HELP LINE CENTRE. Later I feel...this all  things out of my control so I paid 1650 & installed the product. My Local Dealer Name & contact details - GOUTAM PYNE, BANKURA, 8250950073, PIN- 722101, West Bengal.

It has all the same features as this one with that extra feature. As for the UV Lamp, it is not mentioned anywhere on Kent's Website or User Manual but by the looks of it, it does feel like a Stainless Steel Chamber (Do ask the Installation Guy or the Customer Service for the same). This was my Overall Experience for now and I opted than any other brand only because of that 3 years Extended AMC they are offering as opposed to their rivals. Thank You.

  The package was opened by KENT service person and he found that UF Membrane cartridge is broken and bypassed the connection.  Also he discouraged online purchase.  Instead of returning, he suggested to lodge a request via KENT Service App.  But it displays that my phone number is not updated.  At the same time it dispalys my  mobile number and address.  If the company do not replace the item, I have to return the unit for replacement

  Packaging was good.Water tastes good.Better than the previous version in terms of design.Installation was done in a timely manner.Storage indicator available but has no light.Required to buy the extra side filter and the cover for the Kent filter.Power consumption is less and purified water is 1 ltr for 2 ltr tap water.

  I recommend don't buy........1 - fake 1 year warranty and 3 year service free .After installation make abnormal sound and highly vibration in Kent RO inner parts ,After many times requested to customer Care no help and no response. Only say \"aapki Puri Shayta ki jayegi ,\"I requested to kent from Kent service app and also from customer Care number but after more then 15 days no service provided .2- price very very high ( same features) then other company and no quality and worst customer Care.3- Kent no free installation, if you call for installation then service person say you must buy prefilter from us and gives price 950 rupye extra. My prefilter buy from Amazon with KENR RO because prefilter recommendation by amazon, service person say you pay 300 rupye extra for your prefilter instaillation and no warranty provide KENT, if you Installation your prefilter ( I call customer care but no more help from Kent service center).4- don't go in brand name and high price because not always right,  brand name and high price.

  The installation request was raised on 16th Dec., however, no one has come to install it, that too even after calling customer care of kent 2-3 times. They assign the installation to one technician, who first told that he can come only between 10:30 AM to 1 PM, which did not match with my office hours, so i requested him to come earlier or in the evening, he didnt agree. I again contacted Kent customer care on Saturday (21 dec.) and requested them to schedule installation at the earliest, they scheduled installation at 3:30 PM same day, however, assigned the installation to the very same person who had been assigned earlier, and as usual he never came. I contacted kent customer care again on Sunday, however, of no use. It has become so difficult to get it installed, had i known it i would have never bought it

  Not filtering properly. Filtered water is containing white thread like particles. No support from customer care side. They are not replacing the faulty parts. Service center technician and owner and Kent Area sales manager all have seen the problem by home visit telling lie to the kent and denying to replace the part . They want me to do Lab test report for the water to get the part replaced.Very BAD SUPPORT from KENT. They don't want to replace the part becoz it is under warranty.NEVER BUY ANYTHING FROM KENT. THEY WILL NOT CHANGE THE PART BECAUSE IT IS UNDER WARRANTY. they will change the parts only when u give them money.

  I used this product from yesterday, so not to put any comments regarding the quality. Delivered on time by ATS, thanks for Amazon but I faced issues whenever I installed the product. After two days later technician came & tell me for purchasing Prefilter (Sediment Filter) which cost is  1650/ & also tell me if I not purchased the Pre-filter he back without installing the product. So I contact the Kent customer service & tell all the issues. After called the helpline I knew the actual price of Prefilter..700/. Nothing happens after lots of conference calld between Kent executive, local dealer & me. Me & my family members was frastete from the brand KENT. As per telephonic discussion with help line they arranged a senior manager call within two hours but write now I am not received any call from KENT HELP LINE CENTRE. Later I feel...this all  things out of my control so I paid 1650 & installed the product. My Local Dealer Name & contact details - GOUTAM PYNE, BANKURA, 8250950073, PIN- 722101, West Bengal.

  Would have given zero rating if it was possible, i have been a kent customer for years and over the years kents service and product has come down to a such low that its useless, feel cheated after buying this product, my advice do not go for kent products and check for alternatives,The installation is supposedly free, but the service engineer will always push for a pre-filter, this was usual and i have experienced this before so i was ok with it, but now these guys have come up with a new concept of pressure reducing valve and says this avoids the purifier from bursting in case of high pressure and also avoids air getting in, now both of these components seems reasonable and cannot be avoided then why is this not provided by default with the purifier as these are part of safety.All this is not even start, the machine i recieved had wrong internal connection of water flow (not sure wether it was wrong or the installation guy had poor knowledge) so he had to correct it, this shocked me as a purifier which is factory assembled and passed their quality and testing check should not ideally have wrong connection.After all this circus the purifier have started leaking water even after the purifier was powered down, and now i have shut the water line to the purifier so that i can avoid flooding of my apartment, and have come to a realization the poor water taste i was facing was because the water was never getting purified and it was just passing through as is.Now this is a clear case of defective product but kent does not have any return or replacement they can only service and i have to hope that they would fix it.

  I Purchased this Product on July 9, 2020, at around 7 pm and it was delivered on July 12, 2020, around 2 pm. I requested for the Installation as soon as receiving the Product and the Service Guy came within an Hour after calling me for the address info. The purifier was Installed on the same day even though 12th July being a Sunday. I would urge others to request for the Installation and not wait for the Brand to call back as it may take time as they offer service according to the Queue. Also, Speed of Installation or Service may take time as per the Service Provider Availability. In my case, the Installation Work was given to their Authorised Service Centre in my area. The Service Guy himself did everything on his own and the Overall Experience was Satisfactory. He asked me for the Prefilter on the call before coming and told me the price to be 700 ( which may vary with Service Provider) which I agreed. After the installation, he said he changed the Inline Sediment Filter as it was defective but being in warranty it won't cost me a buck. He also asked me for my preferred TDS Level and he suggested to set it at 80. One thing to note is that the TDS level can only be set by the Service Guy with the help of a screw and there's no knob or button available to the end-user. Another thing he told me is that the Warranty for the Sediment and Carbon Filters is 6 months and for other filters and Parts is 1 year, In that period, the Respective Parts will be changed free of cost by the Service Guy himself. After the One Year, Only Service will be Free (Visiting and Maintenance Charges) but the Filters or any other parts have to bear by the Consumer (500-1000 for filters and 2500 for water pump). He also suggested changing the Prefilter every 3 months which will cost around 100-200. For other filters, it may vary according to the Water Consumption and the Water Quality of the Source. Although filters should be changed at least once a year. One Important thing to note before buying this particular product which I completely missed is that Kent New Grand doesn't come with a UV lamp inside Storage Tank, whereas it is present in the Newer Model Kent New Grand Plus. I would highly recommend going for that Model as it is only 1000 rupees (at max) more than this one but the extra UV lamp does ensure there are no bacterias present in the Storage Tank itself after all the Purification has been done ( It comes with a 9L tank as compared to 8L).

  The installation request was raised on 16th Dec., however, no one has come to install it, that too even after calling customer care of kent 2-3 times. They assign the installation to one technician, who first told that he can come only between 10:30 AM to 1 PM, which did not match with my office hours, so i requested him to come earlier or in the evening, he didnt agree. I again contacted Kent customer care on Saturday (21 dec.) and requested them to schedule installation at the earliest, they scheduled installation at 3:30 PM same day, however, assigned the installation to the very same person who had been assigned earlier, and as usual he never came. I contacted kent customer care again on Sunday, however, of no use. It has become so difficult to get it installed, had i known it i would have never bought it

  Not filtering properly. Filtered water is containing white thread like particles. No support from customer care side. They are not replacing the faulty parts. Service center technician and owner and Kent Area sales manager all have seen the problem by home visit telling lie to the kent and denying to replace the part . They want me to do Lab test report for the water to get the part replaced.Very BAD SUPPORT from KENT. They don't want to replace the part becoz it is under warranty.NEVER BUY ANYTHING FROM KENT. THEY WILL NOT CHANGE THE PART BECAUSE IT IS UNDER WARRANTY. they will change the parts only when u give them money.

  I used this product from yesterday, so not to put any comments regarding the quality. Delivered on time by ATS, thanks for Amazon but I faced issues whenever I installed the product. After two days later technician came & tell me for purchasing Prefilter (Sediment Filter) which cost is  1650/ & also tell me if I not purchased the Pre-filter he back without installing the product. So I contact the Kent customer service & tell all the issues. After called the helpline I knew the actual price of Prefilter..700/. Nothing happens after lots of conference calld between Kent executive, local dealer & me. Me & my family members was frastete from the brand KENT. As per telephonic discussion with help line they arranged a senior manager call within two hours but write now I am not received any call from KENT HELP LINE CENTRE. Later I feel...this all  things out of my control so I paid 1650 & installed the product. My Local Dealer Name & contact details - GOUTAM PYNE, BANKURA, 8250950073, PIN- 722101, West Bengal.

  Would have given zero rating if it was possible, i have been a kent customer for years and over the years kents service and product has come down to a such low that its useless, feel cheated after buying this product, my advice do not go for kent products and check for alternatives,The installation is supposedly free, but the service engineer will always push for a pre-filter, this was usual and i have experienced this before so i was ok with it, but now these guys have come up with a new concept of pressure reducing valve and says this avoids the purifier from bursting in case of high pressure and also avoids air getting in, now both of these components seems reasonable and cannot be avoided then why is this not provided by default with the purifier as these are part of safety.All this is not even start, the machine i recieved had wrong internal connection of water flow (not sure wether it was wrong or the installation guy had poor knowledge) so he had to correct it, this shocked me as a purifier which is factory assembled and passed their quality and testing check should not ideally have wrong connection.After all this circus the purifier have started leaking water even after the purifier was powered down, and now i have shut the water line to the purifier so that i can avoid flooding of my apartment, and have come to a realization the poor water taste i was facing was because the water was never getting purified and it was just passing through as is.Now this is a clear case of defective product but kent does not have any return or replacement they can only service and i have to hope that they would fix it.

  I Purchased this Product on July 9, 2020, at around 7 pm and it was delivered on July 12, 2020, around 2 pm. I requested for the Installation as soon as receiving the Product and the Service Guy came within an Hour after calling me for the address info. The purifier was Installed on the same day even though 12th July being a Sunday. I would urge others to request for the Installation and not wait for the Brand to call back as it may take time as they offer service according to the Queue. Also, Speed of Installation or Service may take time as per the Service Provider Availability. In my case, the Installation Work was given to their Authorised Service Centre in my area. The Service Guy himself did everything on his own and the Overall Experience was Satisfactory. He asked me for the Prefilter on the call before coming and told me the price to be 700 ( which may vary with Service Provider) which I agreed. After the installation, he said he changed the Inline Sediment Filter as it was defective but being in warranty it won't cost me a buck. He also asked me for my preferred TDS Level and he suggested to set it at 80. One thing to note is that the TDS level can only be set by the Service Guy with the help of a screw and there's no knob or button available to the end-user. Another thing he told me is that the Warranty for the Sediment and Carbon Filters is 6 months and for other filters and Parts is 1 year, In that period, the Respective Parts will be changed free of cost by the Service Guy himself. After the One Year, Only Service will be Free (Visiting and Maintenance Charges) but the Filters or any other parts have to bear by the Consumer (500-1000 for filters and 2500 for water pump). He also suggested changing the Prefilter every 3 months which will cost around 100-200. For other filters, it may vary according to the Water Consumption and the Water Quality of the Source. Although filters should be changed at least once a year. One Important thing to note before buying this particular product which I completely missed is that Kent New Grand doesn't come with a UV lamp inside Storage Tank, whereas it is present in the Newer Model Kent New Grand Plus. I would highly recommend going for that Model as it is only 1000 rupees (at max) more than this one but the extra UV lamp does ensure there are no bacterias present in the Storage Tank itself after all the Purification has been done ( It comes with a 9L tank as compared to 8L). It has all the same features as this one with that extra feature. As for the UV Lamp, it is not mentioned anywhere on Kent's Website or User Manual but by the looks of it, it does feel like a Stainless Steel Chamber (Do ask the Installation Guy or the Customer Service for the same). This was my Overall Experience for now and I opted than any other brand only because of that 3 years Extended AMC they are offering as opposed to their rivals. Thank You.

  The package was opened by KENT service person and he found that UF Membrane cartridge is broken and bypassed the connection.  Also he discouraged online purchase.  Instead of returning, he suggested to lodge a request via KENT Service App.  But it displays that my phone number is not updated.  At the same time it dispalys my  mobile number and address.  If the company do not replace the item, I have to return the unit for replacement

  Packaging was good.Water tastes good.Better than the previous version in terms of design.Installation was done in a timely manner.Storage indicator available but has no light.Required to buy the extra side filter and the cover for the Kent filter.Power consumption is less and purified water is 1 ltr for 2 ltr tap water.

  I recommend don't buy........1 - fake 1 year warranty and 3 year service free .After installation make abnormal sound and highly vibration in Kent RO inner parts ,After many times requested to customer Care no help and no response. Only say \"aapki Puri Shayta ki jayegi ,\"I requested to kent from Kent service app and also from customer Care number but after more then 15 days no service provided .2- price very very high ( same features) then other company and no quality and worst customer Care.3- Kent no free installation, if you call for installation then service person say you must buy prefilter from us and gives price 950 rupye extra. My prefilter buy from Amazon with KENR RO because prefilter recommendation by amazon, service person say you pay 300 rupye extra for your prefilter instaillation and no warranty provide KENT, if you Installation your prefilter ( I call customer care but no more help from Kent service center).4- don't go in brand name and high price because not always right,  brand name and high price.

  Would have given zero rating if it was possible, i have been a kent customer for years and over the years kents service and product has come down to a such low that its useless, feel cheated after buying this product, my advice do not go for kent products and check for alternatives,The installation is supposedly free, but the service engineer will always push for a pre-filter, this was usual and i have experienced this before so i was ok with it, but now these guys have come up with a new concept of pressure reducing valve and says this avoids the purifier from bursting in case of high pressure and also avoids air getting in, now both of these components seems reasonable and cannot be avoided then why is this not provided by default with the purifier as these are part of safety.All this is not even start, the machine i recieved had wrong internal connection of water flow (not sure wether it was wrong or the installation guy had poor knowledge) so he had to correct it, this shocked me as a purifier which is factory assembled and passed their quality and testing check should not ideally have wrong connection.After all this circus the purifier have started leaking water even after the purifier was powered down, and now i have shut the water line to the purifier so that i can avoid flooding of my apartment, and have come to a realization the poor water taste i was facing was because the water was never getting purified and it was just passing through as is.Now this is a clear case of defective product but kent does not have any return or replacement they can only service and i have to hope that they would fix it.

  I Purchased this Product on July 9, 2020, at around 7 pm and it was delivered on July 12, 2020, around 2 pm. I requested for the Installation as soon as receiving the Product and the Service Guy came within an Hour after calling me for the address info. The purifier was Installed on the same day even though 12th July being a Sunday. I would urge others to request for the Installation and not wait for the Brand to call back as it may take time as they offer service according to the Queue. Also, Speed of Installation or Service may take time as per the Service Provider Availability. In my case, the Installation Work was given to their Authorised Service Centre in my area. The Service Guy himself did everything on his own and the Overall Experience was Satisfactory. He asked me for the Prefilter on the call before coming and told me the price to be 700 ( which may vary with Service Provider) which I agreed. After the installation, he said he changed the Inline Sediment Filter as it was defective but being in warranty it won't cost me a buck. He also asked me for my preferred TDS Level and he suggested to set it at 80. One thing to note is that the TDS level can only be set by the Service Guy with the help of a screw and there's no knob or button available to the end-user. Another thing he told me is that the Warranty for the Sediment and Carbon Filters is 6 months and for other filters and Parts is 1 year, In that period, the Respective Parts will be changed free of cost by the Service Guy himself. After the One Year, Only Service will be Free (Visiting and Maintenance Charges) but the Filters or any other parts have to bear by the Consumer (500-1000 for filters and 2500 for water pump). He also suggested changing the Prefilter every 3 months which will cost around 100-200. For other filters, it may vary according to the Water Consumption and the Water Quality of the Source. Although filters should be changed at least once a year. One Important thing to note before buying this particular product which I completely missed is that Kent New Grand doesn't come with a UV lamp inside Storage Tank, whereas it is present in the Newer Model Kent New Grand Plus. I would highly recommend going for that Model as it is only 1000 rupees (at max) more than this one but the extra UV lamp does ensure there are no bacterias present in the Storage Tank itself after all the Purification has been done ( It comes with a 9L tank as compared to 8L). It has all the same features as this one with that extra feature. As for the UV Lamp, it is not mentioned anywhere on Kent's Website or User Manual but by the looks of it, it does feel like a Stainless Steel Chamber (Do ask the Installation Guy or the Customer Service for the same). This was my Overall Experience for now and I opted than any other brand only because of that 3 years Extended AMC they are offering as opposed to their rivals. Thank You.

  The package was opened by KENT service person and he found that UF Membrane cartridge is broken and bypassed the connection.  Also he discouraged online purchase.  Instead of returning, he suggested to lodge a request via KENT Service App.  But it displays that my phone number is not updated.  At the same time it dispalys my  mobile number and address.  If the company do not replace the item, I have to return the unit for replacement

  Packaging was good.Water tastes good.Better than the previous version in terms of design.Installation was done in a timely manner.Storage indicator available but has no light.Required to buy the extra side filter and the cover for the Kent filter.Power consumption is less and purified water is 1 ltr for 2 ltr tap water.

  I recommend don't buy........1 - fake 1 year warranty and 3 year service free .After installation make abnormal sound and highly vibration in Kent RO inner parts ,After many times requested to customer Care no help and no response. Only say \"aapki Puri Shayta ki jayegi ,\"I requested to kent from Kent service app and also from customer Care number but after more then 15 days no service provided .2- price very very high ( same features) then other company and no quality and worst customer Care.3- Kent no free installation, if you call for installation then service person say you must buy prefilter from us and gives price 950 rupye extra. My prefilter buy from Amazon with KENR RO because prefilter recommendation by amazon, service person say you pay 300 rupye extra for your prefilter instaillation and no warranty provide KENT, if you Installation your prefilter ( I call customer care but no more help from Kent service center).4- don't go in brand name and high price because not always right,  brand name and high price.

  The installation request was raised on 16th Dec., however, no one has come to install it, that too even after calling customer care of kent 2-3 times. They assign the installation to one technician, who first told that he can come only between 10:30 AM to 1 PM, which did not match with my office hours, so i requested him to come earlier or in the evening, he didnt agree. I again contacted Kent customer care on Saturday (21 dec.) and requested them to schedule installation at the earliest, they scheduled installation at 3:30 PM same day, however, assigned the installation to the very same person who had been assigned earlier, and as usual he never came. I contacted kent customer care again on Sunday, however, of no use. It has become so difficult to get it installed, had i known it i would have never bought it

  Not filtering properly. Filtered water is containing white thread like particles. No support from customer care side. They are not replacing the faulty parts. Service center technician and owner and Kent Area sales manager all have seen the problem by home visit telling lie to the kent and denying to replace the part . They want me to do Lab test report for the water to get the part replaced.Very BAD SUPPORT from KENT. They don't want to replace the part becoz it is under warranty.NEVER BUY ANYTHING FROM KENT. THEY WILL NOT CHANGE THE PART BECAUSE IT IS UNDER WARRANTY. they will change the parts only when u give them money.

  I used this product from yesterday, so not to put any comments regarding the quality. Delivered on time by ATS, thanks for Amazon but I faced issues whenever I installed the product. After two days later technician came & tell me for purchasing Prefilter (Sediment Filter) which cost is  1650/ & also tell me if I not purchased the Pre-filter he back without installing the product. So I contact the Kent customer service & tell all the issues. After called the helpline I knew the actual price of Prefilter..700/. Nothing happens after lots of conference calld between Kent executive, local dealer & me. Me & my family members was frastete from the brand KENT. As per telephonic discussion with help line they arranged a senior manager call within two hours but write now I am not received any call from KENT HELP LINE CENTRE. Later I feel...this all  things out of my control so I paid 1650 & installed the product. My Local Dealer Name & contact details - GOUTAM PYNE, BANKURA, 8250950073, PIN- 722101, West Bengal.

It has all the same features as this one with that extra feature. As for the UV Lamp, it is not mentioned anywhere on Kent's Website or User Manual but by the looks of it, it does feel like a Stainless Steel Chamber (Do ask the Installation Guy or the Customer Service for the same). This was my Overall Experience for now and I opted than any other brand only because of that 3 years Extended AMC they are offering as opposed to their rivals. Thank You.

  The package was opened by KENT service person and he found that UF Membrane cartridge is broken and bypassed the connection.  Also he discouraged online purchase.  Instead of returning, he suggested to lodge a request via KENT Service App.  But it displays that my phone number is not updated.  At the same time it dispalys my  mobile number and address.  If the company do not replace the item, I have to return the unit for replacement

  Packaging was good.Water tastes good.Better than the previous version in terms of design.Installation was done in a timely manner.Storage indicator available but has no light.Required to buy the extra side filter and the cover for the Kent filter.Power consumption is less and purified water is 1 ltr for 2 ltr tap water.

  I recommend don't buy........1 - fake 1 year warranty and 3 year service free .After installation make abnormal sound and highly vibration in Kent RO inner parts ,After many times requested to customer Care no help and no response. Only say \"aapki Puri Shayta ki jayegi ,\"I requested to kent from Kent service app and also from customer Care number but after more then 15 days no service provided .2- price very very high ( same features) then other company and no quality and worst customer Care.3- Kent no free installation, if you call for installation then service person say you must buy prefilter from us and gives price 950 rupye extra. My prefilter buy from Amazon with KENR RO because prefilter recommendation by amazon, service person say you pay 300 rupye extra for your prefilter instaillation and no warranty provide KENT, if you Installation your prefilter ( I call customer care but no more help from Kent service center).4- don't go in brand name and high price because not always right,  brand name and high price.

  The installation request was raised on 16th Dec., however, no one has come to install it, that too even after calling customer care of kent 2-3 times. They assign the installation to one technician, who first told that he can come only between 10:30 AM to 1 PM, which did not match with my office hours, so i requested him to come earlier or in the evening, he didnt agree. I again contacted Kent customer care on Saturday (21 dec.) and requested them to schedule installation at the earliest, they scheduled installation at 3:30 PM same day, however, assigned the installation to the very same person who had been assigned earlier, and as usual he never came. I contacted kent customer care again on Sunday, however, of no use. It has become so difficult to get it installed, had i known it i would have never bought it

  Not filtering properly. Filtered water is containing white thread like particles. No support from customer care side. They are not replacing the faulty parts. Service center technician and owner and Kent Area sales manager all have seen the problem by home visit telling lie to the kent and denying to replace the part . They want me to do Lab test report for the water to get the part replaced.Very BAD SUPPORT from KENT. They don't want to replace the part becoz it is under warranty.NEVER BUY ANYTHING FROM KENT. THEY WILL NOT CHANGE THE PART BECAUSE IT IS UNDER WARRANTY. they will change the parts only when u give them money.

  I used this product from yesterday, so not to put any comments regarding the quality. Delivered on time by ATS, thanks for Amazon but I faced issues whenever I installed the product. After two days later technician came & tell me for purchasing Prefilter (Sediment Filter) which cost is  1650/ & also tell me if I not purchased the Pre-filter he back without installing the product. So I contact the Kent customer service & tell all the issues. After called the helpline I knew the actual price of Prefilter..700/. Nothing happens after lots of conference calld between Kent executive, local dealer & me. Me & my family members was frastete from the brand KENT. As per telephonic discussion with help line they arranged a senior manager call within two hours but write now I am not received any call from KENT HELP LINE CENTRE. Later I feel...this all  things out of my control so I paid 1650 & installed the product. My Local Dealer Name & contact details - GOUTAM PYNE, BANKURA, 8250950073, PIN- 722101, West Bengal.

  Would have given zero rating if it was possible, i have been a kent customer for years and over the years kents service and product has come down to a such low that its useless, feel cheated after buying this product, my advice do not go for kent products and check for alternatives,The installation is supposedly free, but the service engineer will always push for a pre-filter, this was usual and i have experienced this before so i was ok with it, but now these guys have come up with a new concept of pressure reducing valve and says this avoids the purifier from bursting in case of high pressure and also avoids air getting in, now both of these components seems reasonable and cannot be avoided then why is this not provided by default with the purifier as these are part of safety.All this is not even start, the machine i recieved had wrong internal connection of water flow (not sure wether it was wrong or the installation guy had poor knowledge) so he had to correct it, this shocked me as a purifier which is factory assembled and passed their quality and testing check should not ideally have wrong connection.After all this circus the purifier have started leaking water even after the purifier was powered down, and now i have shut the water line to the purifier so that i can avoid flooding of my apartment, and have come to a realization the poor water taste i was facing was because the water was never getting purified and it was just passing through as is.Now this is a clear case of defective product but kent does not have any return or replacement they can only service and i have to hope that they would fix it.

  I Purchased this Product on July 9, 2020, at around 7 pm and it was delivered on July 12, 2020, around 2 pm. I requested for the Installation as soon as receiving the Product and the Service Guy came within an Hour after calling me for the address info. The purifier was Installed on the same day even though 12th July being a Sunday. I would urge others to request for the Installation and not wait for the Brand to call back as it may take time as they offer service according to the Queue. Also, Speed of Installation or Service may take time as per the Service Provider Availability. In my case, the Installation Work was given to their Authorised Service Centre in my area. The Service Guy himself did everything on his own and the Overall Experience was Satisfactory. He asked me for the Prefilter on the call before coming and told me the price to be 700 ( which may vary with Service Provider) which I agreed. After the installation, he said he changed the Inline Sediment Filter as it was defective but being in warranty it won't cost me a buck. He also asked me for my preferred TDS Level and he suggested to set it at 80. One thing to note is that the TDS level can only be set by the Service Guy with the help of a screw and there's no knob or button available to the end-user. Another thing he told me is that the Warranty for the Sediment and Carbon Filters is 6 months and for other filters and Parts is 1 year, In that period, the Respective Parts will be changed free of cost by the Service Guy himself. After the One Year, Only Service will be Free (Visiting and Maintenance Charges) but the Filters or any other parts have to bear by the Consumer (500-1000 for filters and 2500 for water pump). He also suggested changing the Prefilter every 3 months which will cost around 100-200. For other filters, it may vary according to the Water Consumption and the Water Quality of the Source. Although filters should be changed at least once a year. One Important thing to note before buying this particular product which I completely missed is that Kent New Grand doesn't come with a UV lamp inside Storage Tank, whereas it is present in the Newer Model Kent New Grand Plus. I would highly recommend going for that Model as it is only 1000 rupees (at max) more than this one but the extra UV lamp does ensure there are no bacterias present in the Storage Tank itself after all the Purification has been done ( It comes with a 9L tank as compared to 8L).

  The installation request was raised on 16th Dec., however, no one has come to install it, that too even after calling customer care of kent 2-3 times. They assign the installation to one technician, who first told that he can come only between 10:30 AM to 1 PM, which did not match with my office hours, so i requested him to come earlier or in the evening, he didnt agree. I again contacted Kent customer care on Saturday (21 dec.) and requested them to schedule installation at the earliest, they scheduled installation at 3:30 PM same day, however, assigned the installation to the very same person who had been assigned earlier, and as usual he never came. I contacted kent customer care again on Sunday, however, of no use. It has become so difficult to get it installed, had i known it i would have never bought it

  Not filtering properly. Filtered water is containing white thread like particles. No support from customer care side. They are not replacing the faulty parts. Service center technician and owner and Kent Area sales manager all have seen the problem by home visit telling lie to the kent and denying to replace the part . They want me to do Lab test report for the water to get the part replaced.Very BAD SUPPORT from KENT. They don't want to replace the part becoz it is under warranty.NEVER BUY ANYTHING FROM KENT. THEY WILL NOT CHANGE THE PART BECAUSE IT IS UNDER WARRANTY. they will change the parts only when u give them money.

  I used this product from yesterday, so not to put any comments regarding the quality. Delivered on time by ATS, thanks for Amazon but I faced issues whenever I installed the product. After two days later technician came & tell me for purchasing Prefilter (Sediment Filter) which cost is  1650/ & also tell me if I not purchased the Pre-filter he back without installing the product. So I contact the Kent customer service & tell all the issues. After called the helpline I knew the actual price of Prefilter..700/. Nothing happens after lots of conference calld between Kent executive, local dealer & me. Me & my family members was frastete from the brand KENT. As per telephonic discussion with help line they arranged a senior manager call within two hours but write now I am not received any call from KENT HELP LINE CENTRE. Later I feel...this all  things out of my control so I paid 1650 & installed the product. My Local Dealer Name & contact details - GOUTAM PYNE, BANKURA, 8250950073, PIN- 722101, West Bengal.

  Would have given zero rating if it was possible, i have been a kent customer for years and over the years kents service and product has come down to a such low that its useless, feel cheated after buying this product, my advice do not go for kent products and check for alternatives,The installation is supposedly free, but the service engineer will always push for a pre-filter, this was usual and i have experienced this before so i was ok with it, but now these guys have come up with a new concept of pressure reducing valve and says this avoids the purifier from bursting in case of high pressure and also avoids air getting in, now both of these components seems reasonable and cannot be avoided then why is this not provided by default with the purifier as these are part of safety.All this is not even start, the machine i recieved had wrong internal connection of water flow (not sure wether it was wrong or the installation guy had poor knowledge) so he had to correct it, this shocked me as a purifier which is factory assembled and passed their quality and testing check should not ideally have wrong connection.After all this circus the purifier have started leaking water even after the purifier was powered down, and now i have shut the water line to the purifier so that i can avoid flooding of my apartment, and have come to a realization the poor water taste i was facing was because the water was never getting purified and it was just passing through as is.Now this is a clear case of defective product but kent does not have any return or replacement they can only service and i have to hope that they would fix it.

  I Purchased this Product on July 9, 2020, at around 7 pm and it was delivered on July 12, 2020, around 2 pm. I requested for the Installation as soon as receiving the Product and the Service Guy came within an Hour after calling me for the address info. The purifier was Installed on the same day even though 12th July being a Sunday. I would urge others to request for the Installation and not wait for the Brand to call back as it may take time as they offer service according to the Queue. Also, Speed of Installation or Service may take time as per the Service Provider Availability. In my case, the Installation Work was given to their Authorised Service Centre in my area. The Service Guy himself did everything on his own and the Overall Experience was Satisfactory. He asked me for the Prefilter on the call before coming and told me the price to be 700 ( which may vary with Service Provider) which I agreed. After the installation, he said he changed the Inline Sediment Filter as it was defective but being in warranty it won't cost me a buck. He also asked me for my preferred TDS Level and he suggested to set it at 80. One thing to note is that the TDS level can only be set by the Service Guy with the help of a screw and there's no knob or button available to the end-user. Another thing he told me is that the Warranty for the Sediment and Carbon Filters is 6 months and for other filters and Parts is 1 year, In that period, the Respective Parts will be changed free of cost by the Service Guy himself. After the One Year, Only Service will be Free (Visiting and Maintenance Charges) but the Filters or any other parts have to bear by the Consumer (500-1000 for filters and 2500 for water pump). He also suggested changing the Prefilter every 3 months which will cost around 100-200. For other filters, it may vary according to the Water Consumption and the Water Quality of the Source. Although filters should be changed at least once a year. One Important thing to note before buying this particular product which I completely missed is that Kent New Grand doesn't come with a UV lamp inside Storage Tank, whereas it is present in the Newer Model Kent New Grand Plus. I would highly recommend going for that Model as it is only 1000 rupees (at max) more than this one but the extra UV lamp does ensure there are no bacterias present in the Storage Tank itself after all the Purification has been done ( It comes with a 9L tank as compared to 8L). It has all the same features as this one with that extra feature. As for the UV Lamp, it is not mentioned anywhere on Kent's Website or User Manual but by the looks of it, it does feel like a Stainless Steel Chamber (Do ask the Installation Guy or the Customer Service for the same). This was my Overall Experience for now and I opted than any other brand only because of that 3 years Extended AMC they are offering as opposed to their rivals. Thank You.

  The package was opened by KENT service person and he found that UF Membrane cartridge is broken and bypassed the connection.  Also he discouraged online purchase.  Instead of returning, he suggested to lodge a request via KENT Service App.  But it displays that my phone number is not updated.  At the same time it dispalys my  mobile number and address.  If the company do not replace the item, I have to return the unit for replacement

  Packaging was good.Water tastes good.Better than the previous version in terms of design.Installation was done in a timely manner.Storage indicator available but has no light.Required to buy the extra side filter and the cover for the Kent filter.Power consumption is less and purified water is 1 ltr for 2 ltr tap water.

  I recommend don't buy........1 - fake 1 year warranty and 3 year service free .After installation make abnormal sound and highly vibration in Kent RO inner parts ,After many times requested to customer Care no help and no response. Only say \"aapki Puri Shayta ki jayegi ,\"I requested to kent from Kent service app and also from customer Care number but after more then 15 days no service provided .2- price very very high ( same features) then other company and no quality and worst customer Care.3- Kent no free installation, if you call for installation then service person say you must buy prefilter from us and gives price 950 rupye extra. My prefilter buy from Amazon with KENR RO because prefilter recommendation by amazon, service person say you pay 300 rupye extra for your prefilter instaillation and no warranty provide KENT, if you Installation your prefilter ( I call customer care but no more help from Kent service center).4- don't go in brand name and high price because not always right,  brand name and high price.

  Would have given zero rating if it was possible, i have been a kent customer for years and over the years kents service and product has come down to a such low that its useless, feel cheated after buying this product, my advice do not go for kent products and check for alternatives,The installation is supposedly free, but the service engineer will always push for a pre-filter, this was usual and i have experienced this before so i was ok with it, but now these guys have come up with a new concept of pressure reducing valve and says this avoids the purifier from bursting in case of high pressure and also avoids air getting in, now both of these components seems reasonable and cannot be avoided then why is this not provided by default with the purifier as these are part of safety.All this is not even start, the machine i recieved had wrong internal connection of water flow (not sure wether it was wrong or the installation guy had poor knowledge) so he had to correct it, this shocked me as a purifier which is factory assembled and passed their quality and testing check should not ideally have wrong connection.After all this circus the purifier have started leaking water even after the purifier was powered down, and now i have shut the water line to the purifier so that i can avoid flooding of my apartment, and have come to a realization the poor water taste i was facing was because the water was never getting purified and it was just passing through as is.Now this is a clear case of defective product but kent does not have any return or replacement they can only service and i have to hope that they would fix it.

  I Purchased this Product on July 9, 2020, at around 7 pm and it was delivered on July 12, 2020, around 2 pm. I requested for the Installation as soon as receiving the Product and the Service Guy came within an Hour after calling me for the address info. The purifier was Installed on the same day even though 12th July being a Sunday. I would urge others to request for the Installation and not wait for the Brand to call back as it may take time as they offer service according to the Queue. Also, Speed of Installation or Service may take time as per the Service Provider Availability. In my case, the Installation Work was given to their Authorised Service Centre in my area. The Service Guy himself did everything on his own and the Overall Experience was Satisfactory. He asked me for the Prefilter on the call before coming and told me the price to be 700 ( which may vary with Service Provider) which I agreed. After the installation, he said he changed the Inline Sediment Filter as it was defective but being in warranty it won't cost me a buck. He also asked me for my preferred TDS Level and he suggested to set it at 80. One thing to note is that the TDS level can only be set by the Service Guy with the help of a screw and there's no knob or button available to the end-user. Another thing he told me is that the Warranty for the Sediment and Carbon Filters is 6 months and for other filters and Parts is 1 year, In that period, the Respective Parts will be changed free of cost by the Service Guy himself. After the One Year, Only Service will be Free (Visiting and Maintenance Charges) but the Filters or any other parts have to bear by the Consumer (500-1000 for filters and 2500 for water pump). He also suggested changing the Prefilter every 3 months which will cost around 100-200. For other filters, it may vary according to the Water Consumption and the Water Quality of the Source. Although filters should be changed at least once a year. One Important thing to note before buying this particular product which I completely missed is that Kent New Grand doesn't come with a UV lamp inside Storage Tank, whereas it is present in the Newer Model Kent New Grand Plus. I would highly recommend going for that Model as it is only 1000 rupees (at max) more than this one but the extra UV lamp does ensure there are no bacterias present in the Storage Tank itself after all the Purification has been done ( It comes with a 9L tank as compared to 8L). It has all the same features as this one with that extra feature. As for the UV Lamp, it is not mentioned anywhere on Kent's Website or User Manual but by the looks of it, it does feel like a Stainless Steel Chamber (Do ask the Installation Guy or the Customer Service for the same). This was my Overall Experience for now and I opted than any other brand only because of that 3 years Extended AMC they are offering as opposed to their rivals. Thank You.

  The package was opened by KENT service person and he found that UF Membrane cartridge is broken and bypassed the connection.  Also he discouraged online purchase.  Instead of returning, he suggested to lodge a request via KENT Service App.  But it displays that my phone number is not updated.  At the same time it dispalys my  mobile number and address.  If the company do not replace the item, I have to return the unit for replacement

  Packaging was good.Water tastes good.Better than the previous version in terms of design.Installation was done in a timely manner.Storage indicator available but has no light.Required to buy the extra side filter and the cover for the Kent filter.Power consumption is less and purified water is 1 ltr for 2 ltr tap water.

  I recommend don't buy........1 - fake 1 year warranty and 3 year service free .After installation make abnormal sound and highly vibration in Kent RO inner parts ,After many times requested to customer Care no help and no response. Only say \"aapki Puri Shayta ki jayegi ,\"I requested to kent from Kent service app and also from customer Care number but after more then 15 days no service provided .2- price very very high ( same features) then other company and no quality and worst customer Care.3- Kent no free installation, if you call for installation then service person say you must buy prefilter from us and gives price 950 rupye extra. My prefilter buy from Amazon with KENR RO because prefilter recommendation by amazon, service person say you pay 300 rupye extra for your prefilter instaillation and no warranty provide KENT, if you Installation your prefilter ( I call customer care but no more help from Kent service center).4- don't go in brand name and high price because not always right,  brand name and high price.

  The installation request was raised on 16th Dec., however, no one has come to install it, that too even after calling customer care of kent 2-3 times. They assign the installation to one technician, who first told that he can come only between 10:30 AM to 1 PM, which did not match with my office hours, so i requested him to come earlier or in the evening, he didnt agree. I again contacted Kent customer care on Saturday (21 dec.) and requested them to schedule installation at the earliest, they scheduled installation at 3:30 PM same day, however, assigned the installation to the very same person who had been assigned earlier, and as usual he never came. I contacted kent customer care again on Sunday, however, of no use. It has become so difficult to get it installed, had i known it i would have never bought it

  Not filtering properly. Filtered water is containing white thread like particles. No support from customer care side. They are not replacing the faulty parts. Service center technician and owner and Kent Area sales manager all have seen the problem by home visit telling lie to the kent and denying to replace the part . They want me to do Lab test report for the water to get the part replaced.Very BAD SUPPORT from KENT. They don't want to replace the part becoz it is under warranty.NEVER BUY ANYTHING FROM KENT. THEY WILL NOT CHANGE THE PART BECAUSE IT IS UNDER WARRANTY. they will change the parts only when u give them money.

  I used this product from yesterday, so not to put any comments regarding the quality. Delivered on time by ATS, thanks for Amazon but I faced issues whenever I installed the product. After two days later technician came & tell me for purchasing Prefilter (Sediment Filter) which cost is  1650/ & also tell me if I not purchased the Pre-filter he back without installing the product. So I contact the Kent customer service & tell all the issues. After called the helpline I knew the actual price of Prefilter..700/. Nothing happens after lots of conference calld between Kent executive, local dealer & me. Me & my family members was frastete from the brand KENT. As per telephonic discussion with help line they arranged a senior manager call within two hours but write now I am not received any call from KENT HELP LINE CENTRE. Later I feel...this all  things out of my control so I paid 1650 & installed the product. My Local Dealer Name & contact details - GOUTAM PYNE, BANKURA, 8250950073, PIN- 722101, West Bengal.

It has all the same features as this one with that extra feature. As for the UV Lamp, it is not mentioned anywhere on Kent's Website or User Manual but by the looks of it, it does feel like a Stainless Steel Chamber (Do ask the Installation Guy or the Customer Service for the same). This was my Overall Experience for now and I opted than any other brand only because of that 3 years Extended AMC they are offering as opposed to their rivals. Thank You.

  The package was opened by KENT service person and he found that UF Membrane cartridge is broken and bypassed the connection.  Also he discouraged online purchase.  Instead of returning, he suggested to lodge a request via KENT Service App.  But it displays that my phone number is not updated.  At the same time it dispalys my  mobile number and address.  If the company do not replace the item, I have to return the unit for replacement

  Packaging was good.Water tastes good.Better than the previous version in terms of design.Installation was done in a timely manner.Storage indicator available but has no light.Required to buy the extra side filter and the cover for the Kent filter.Power consumption is less and purified water is 1 ltr for 2 ltr tap water.

  I recommend don't buy........1 - fake 1 year warranty and 3 year service free .After installation make abnormal sound and highly vibration in Kent RO inner parts ,After many times requested to customer Care no help and no response. Only say \"aapki Puri Shayta ki jayegi ,\"I requested to kent from Kent service app and also from customer Care number but after more then 15 days no service provided .2- price very very high ( same features) then other company and no quality and worst customer Care.3- Kent no free installation, if you call for installation then service person say you must buy prefilter from us and gives price 950 rupye extra. My prefilter buy from Amazon with KENR RO because prefilter recommendation by amazon, service person say you pay 300 rupye extra for your prefilter instaillation and no warranty provide KENT, if you Installation your prefilter ( I call customer care but no more help from Kent service center).4- don't go in brand name and high price because not always right,  brand name and high price.

  The installation request was raised on 16th Dec., however, no one has come to install it, that too even after calling customer care of kent 2-3 times. They assign the installation to one technician, who first told that he can come only between 10:30 AM to 1 PM, which did not match with my office hours, so i requested him to come earlier or in the evening, he didnt agree. I again contacted Kent customer care on Saturday (21 dec.) and requested them to schedule installation at the earliest, they scheduled installation at 3:30 PM same day, however, assigned the installation to the very same person who had been assigned earlier, and as usual he never came. I contacted kent customer care again on Sunday, however, of no use. It has become so difficult to get it installed, had i known it i would have never bought it

  Not filtering properly. Filtered water is containing white thread like particles. No support from customer care side. They are not replacing the faulty parts. Service center technician and owner and Kent Area sales manager all have seen the problem by home visit telling lie to the kent and denying to replace the part . They want me to do Lab test report for the water to get the part replaced.Very BAD SUPPORT from KENT. They don't want to replace the part becoz it is under warranty.NEVER BUY ANYTHING FROM KENT. THEY WILL NOT CHANGE THE PART BECAUSE IT IS UNDER WARRANTY. they will change the parts only when u give them money.

  I used this product from yesterday, so not to put any comments regarding the quality. Delivered on time by ATS, thanks for Amazon but I faced issues whenever I installed the product. After two days later technician came & tell me for purchasing Prefilter (Sediment Filter) which cost is  1650/ & also tell me if I not purchased the Pre-filter he back without installing the product. So I contact the Kent customer service & tell all the issues. After called the helpline I knew the actual price of Prefilter..700/. Nothing happens after lots of conference calld between Kent executive, local dealer & me. Me & my family members was frastete from the brand KENT. As per telephonic discussion with help line they arranged a senior manager call within two hours but write now I am not received any call from KENT HELP LINE CENTRE. Later I feel...this all  things out of my control so I paid 1650 & installed the product. My Local Dealer Name & contact details - GOUTAM PYNE, BANKURA, 8250950073, PIN- 722101, West Bengal.

  Would have given zero rating if it was possible, i have been a kent customer for years and over the years kents service and product has come down to a such low that its useless, feel cheated after buying this product, my advice do not go for kent products and check for alternatives,The installation is supposedly free, but the service engineer will always push for a pre-filter, this was usual and i have experienced this before so i was ok with it, but now these guys have come up with a new concept of pressure reducing valve and says this avoids the purifier from bursting in case of high pressure and also avoids air getting in, now both of these components seems reasonable and cannot be avoided then why is this not provided by default with the purifier as these are part of safety.All this is not even start, the machine i recieved had wrong internal connection of water flow (not sure wether it was wrong or the installation guy had poor knowledge) so he had to correct it, this shocked me as a purifier which is factory assembled and passed their quality and testing check should not ideally have wrong connection.After all this circus the purifier have started leaking water even after the purifier was powered down, and now i have shut the water line to the purifier so that i can avoid flooding of my apartment, and have come to a realization the poor water taste i was facing was because the water was never getting purified and it was just passing through as is.Now this is a clear case of defective product but kent does not have any return or replacement they can only service and i have to hope that they would fix it.

  I Purchased this Product on July 9, 2020, at around 7 pm and it was delivered on July 12, 2020, around 2 pm. I requested for the Installation as soon as receiving the Product and the Service Guy came within an Hour after calling me for the address info. The purifier was Installed on the same day even though 12th July being a Sunday. I would urge others to request for the Installation and not wait for the Brand to call back as it may take time as they offer service according to the Queue. Also, Speed of Installation or Service may take time as per the Service Provider Availability. In my case, the Installation Work was given to their Authorised Service Centre in my area. The Service Guy himself did everything on his own and the Overall Experience was Satisfactory. He asked me for the Prefilter on the call before coming and told me the price to be 700 ( which may vary with Service Provider) which I agreed. After the installation, he said he changed the Inline Sediment Filter as it was defective but being in warranty it won't cost me a buck. He also asked me for my preferred TDS Level and he suggested to set it at 80. One thing to note is that the TDS level can only be set by the Service Guy with the help of a screw and there's no knob or button available to the end-user. Another thing he told me is that the Warranty for the Sediment and Carbon Filters is 6 months and for other filters and Parts is 1 year, In that period, the Respective Parts will be changed free of cost by the Service Guy himself. After the One Year, Only Service will be Free (Visiting and Maintenance Charges) but the Filters or any other parts have to bear by the Consumer (500-1000 for filters and 2500 for water pump). He also suggested changing the Prefilter every 3 months which will cost around 100-200. For other filters, it may vary according to the Water Consumption and the Water Quality of the Source. Although filters should be changed at least once a year. One Important thing to note before buying this particular product which I completely missed is that Kent New Grand doesn't come with a UV lamp inside Storage Tank, whereas it is present in the Newer Model Kent New Grand Plus. I would highly recommend going for that Model as it is only 1000 rupees (at max) more than this one but the extra UV lamp does ensure there are no bacterias present in the Storage Tank itself after all the Purification has been done ( It comes with a 9L tank as compared to 8L).

  The installation request was raised on 16th Dec., however, no one has come to install it, that too even after calling customer care of kent 2-3 times. They assign the installation to one technician, who first told that he can come only between 10:30 AM to 1 PM, which did not match with my office hours, so i requested him to come earlier or in the evening, he didnt agree. I again contacted Kent customer care on Saturday (21 dec.) and requested them to schedule installation at the earliest, they scheduled installation at 3:30 PM same day, however, assigned the installation to the very same person who had been assigned earlier, and as usual he never came. I contacted kent customer care again on Sunday, however, of no use. It has become so difficult to get it installed, had i known it i would have never bought it

  Not filtering properly. Filtered water is containing white thread like particles. No support from customer care side. They are not replacing the faulty parts. Service center technician and owner and Kent Area sales manager all have seen the problem by home visit telling lie to the kent and denying to replace the part . They want me to do Lab test report for the water to get the part replaced.Very BAD SUPPORT from KENT. They don't want to replace the part becoz it is under warranty.NEVER BUY ANYTHING FROM KENT. THEY WILL NOT CHANGE THE PART BECAUSE IT IS UNDER WARRANTY. they will change the parts only when u give them money.

  I used this product from yesterday, so not to put any comments regarding the quality. Delivered on time by ATS, thanks for Amazon but I faced issues whenever I installed the product. After two days later technician came & tell me for purchasing Prefilter (Sediment Filter) which cost is  1650/ & also tell me if I not purchased the Pre-filter he back without installing the product. So I contact the Kent customer service & tell all the issues. After called the helpline I knew the actual price of Prefilter..700/. Nothing happens after lots of conference calld between Kent executive, local dealer & me. Me & my family members was frastete from the brand KENT. As per telephonic discussion with help line they arranged a senior manager call within two hours but write now I am not received any call from KENT HELP LINE CENTRE. Later I feel...this all  things out of my control so I paid 1650 & installed the product. My Local Dealer Name & contact details - GOUTAM PYNE, BANKURA, 8250950073, PIN- 722101, West Bengal.

  Would have given zero rating if it was possible, i have been a kent customer for years and over the years kents service and product has come down to a such low that its useless, feel cheated after buying this product, my advice do not go for kent products and check for alternatives,The installation is supposedly free, but the service engineer will always push for a pre-filter, this was usual and i have experienced this before so i was ok with it, but now these guys have come up with a new concept of pressure reducing valve and says this avoids the purifier from bursting in case of high pressure and also avoids air getting in, now both of these components seems reasonable and cannot be avoided then why is this not provided by default with the purifier as these are part of safety.All this is not even start, the machine i recieved had wrong internal connection of water flow (not sure wether it was wrong or the installation guy had poor knowledge) so he had to correct it, this shocked me as a purifier which is factory assembled and passed their quality and testing check should not ideally have wrong connection.After all this circus the purifier have started leaking water even after the purifier was powered down, and now i have shut the water line to the purifier so that i can avoid flooding of my apartment, and have come to a realization the poor water taste i was facing was because the water was never getting purified and it was just passing through as is.Now this is a clear case of defective product but kent does not have any return or replacement they can only service and i have to hope that they would fix it.

  I Purchased this Product on July 9, 2020, at around 7 pm and it was delivered on July 12, 2020, around 2 pm. I requested for the Installation as soon as receiving the Product and the Service Guy came within an Hour after calling me for the address info. The purifier was Installed on the same day even though 12th July being a Sunday. I would urge others to request for the Installation and not wait for the Brand to call back as it may take time as they offer service according to the Queue. Also, Speed of Installation or Service may take time as per the Service Provider Availability. In my case, the Installation Work was given to their Authorised Service Centre in my area. The Service Guy himself did everything on his own and the Overall Experience was Satisfactory. He asked me for the Prefilter on the call before coming and told me the price to be 700 ( which may vary with Service Provider) which I agreed. After the installation, he said he changed the Inline Sediment Filter as it was defective but being in warranty it won't cost me a buck. He also asked me for my preferred TDS Level and he suggested to set it at 80. One thing to note is that the TDS level can only be set by the Service Guy with the help of a screw and there's no knob or button available to the end-user. Another thing he told me is that the Warranty for the Sediment and Carbon Filters is 6 months and for other filters and Parts is 1 year, In that period, the Respective Parts will be changed free of cost by the Service Guy himself. After the One Year, Only Service will be Free (Visiting and Maintenance Charges) but the Filters or any other parts have to bear by the Consumer (500-1000 for filters and 2500 for water pump). He also suggested changing the Prefilter every 3 months which will cost around 100-200. For other filters, it may vary according to the Water Consumption and the Water Quality of the Source. Although filters should be changed at least once a year. One Important thing to note before buying this particular product which I completely missed is that Kent New Grand doesn't come with a UV lamp inside Storage Tank, whereas it is present in the Newer Model Kent New Grand Plus. I would highly recommend going for that Model as it is only 1000 rupees (at max) more than this one but the extra UV lamp does ensure there are no bacterias present in the Storage Tank itself after all the Purification has been done ( It comes with a 9L tank as compared to 8L). It has all the same features as this one with that extra feature. As for the UV Lamp, it is not mentioned anywhere on Kent's Website or User Manual but by the looks of it, it does feel like a Stainless Steel Chamber (Do ask the Installation Guy or the Customer Service for the same). This was my Overall Experience for now and I opted than any other brand only because of that 3 years Extended AMC they are offering as opposed to their rivals. Thank You.

  The package was opened by KENT service person and he found that UF Membrane cartridge is broken and bypassed the connection.  Also he discouraged online purchase.  Instead of returning, he suggested to lodge a request via KENT Service App.  But it displays that my phone number is not updated.  At the same time it dispalys my  mobile number and address.  If the company do not replace the item, I have to return the unit for replacement

  Packaging was good.Water tastes good.Better than the previous version in terms of design.Installation was done in a timely manner.Storage indicator available but has no light.Required to buy the extra side filter and the cover for the Kent filter.Power consumption is less and purified water is 1 ltr for 2 ltr tap water.

  I recommend don't buy........1 - fake 1 year warranty and 3 year service free .After installation make abnormal sound and highly vibration in Kent RO inner parts ,After many times requested to customer Care no help and no response. Only say \"aapki Puri Shayta ki jayegi ,\"I requested to kent from Kent service app and also from customer Care number but after more then 15 days no service provided .2- price very very high ( same features) then other company and no quality and worst customer Care.3- Kent no free installation, if you call for installation then service person say you must buy prefilter from us and gives price 950 rupye extra. My prefilter buy from Amazon with KENR RO because prefilter recommendation by amazon, service person say you pay 300 rupye extra for your prefilter instaillation and no warranty provide KENT, if you Installation your prefilter ( I call customer care but no more help from Kent service center).4- don't go in brand name and high price because not always right,  brand name and high price.

  Would have given zero rating if it was possible, i have been a kent customer for years and over the years kents service and product has come down to a such low that its useless, feel cheated after buying this product, my advice do not go for kent products and check for alternatives,The installation is supposedly free, but the service engineer will always push for a pre-filter, this was usual and i have experienced this before so i was ok with it, but now these guys have come up with a new concept of pressure reducing valve and says this avoids the purifier from bursting in case of high pressure and also avoids air getting in, now both of these components seems reasonable and cannot be avoided then why is this not provided by default with the purifier as these are part of safety.All this is not even start, the machine i recieved had wrong internal connection of water flow (not sure wether it was wrong or the installation guy had poor knowledge) so he had to correct it, this shocked me as a purifier which is factory assembled and passed their quality and testing check should not ideally have wrong connection.After all this circus the purifier have started leaking water even after the purifier was powered down, and now i have shut the water line to the purifier so that i can avoid flooding of my apartment, and have come to a realization the poor water taste i was facing was because the water was never getting purified and it was just passing through as is.Now this is a clear case of defective product but kent does not have any return or replacement they can only service and i have to hope that they would fix it.

  I Purchased this Product on July 9, 2020, at around 7 pm and it was delivered on July 12, 2020, around 2 pm. I requested for the Installation as soon as receiving the Product and the Service Guy came within an Hour after calling me for the address info. The purifier was Installed on the same day even though 12th July being a Sunday. I would urge others to request for the Installation and not wait for the Brand to call back as it may take time as they offer service according to the Queue. Also, Speed of Installation or Service may take time as per the Service Provider Availability. In my case, the Installation Work was given to their Authorised Service Centre in my area. The Service Guy himself did everything on his own and the Overall Experience was Satisfactory. He asked me for the Prefilter on the call before coming and told me the price to be 700 ( which may vary with Service Provider) which I agreed. After the installation, he said he changed the Inline Sediment Filter as it was defective but being in warranty it won't cost me a buck. He also asked me for my preferred TDS Level and he suggested to set it at 80. One thing to note is that the TDS level can only be set by the Service Guy with the help of a screw and there's no knob or button available to the end-user. Another thing he told me is that the Warranty for the Sediment and Carbon Filters is 6 months and for other filters and Parts is 1 year, In that period, the Respective Parts will be changed free of cost by the Service Guy himself. After the One Year, Only Service will be Free (Visiting and Maintenance Charges) but the Filters or any other parts have to bear by the Consumer (500-1000 for filters and 2500 for water pump). He also suggested changing the Prefilter every 3 months which will cost around 100-200. For other filters, it may vary according to the Water Consumption and the Water Quality of the Source. Although filters should be changed at least once a year. One Important thing to note before buying this particular product which I completely missed is that Kent New Grand doesn't come with a UV lamp inside Storage Tank, whereas it is present in the Newer Model Kent New Grand Plus. I would highly recommend going for that Model as it is only 1000 rupees (at max) more than this one but the extra UV lamp does ensure there are no bacterias present in the Storage Tank itself after all the Purification has been done ( It comes with a 9L tank as compared to 8L). It has all the same features as this one with that extra feature. As for the UV Lamp, it is not mentioned anywhere on Kent's Website or User Manual but by the looks of it, it does feel like a Stainless Steel Chamber (Do ask the Installation Guy or the Customer Service for the same). This was my Overall Experience for now and I opted than any other brand only because of that 3 years Extended AMC they are offering as opposed to their rivals. Thank You.

  The package was opened by KENT service person and he found that UF Membrane cartridge is broken and bypassed the connection.  Also he discouraged online purchase.  Instead of returning, he suggested to lodge a request via KENT Service App.  But it displays that my phone number is not updated.  At the same time it dispalys my  mobile number and address.  If the company do not replace the item, I have to return the unit for replacement

  Packaging was good.Water tastes good.Better than the previous version in terms of design.Installation was done in a timely manner.Storage indicator available but has no light.Required to buy the extra side filter and the cover for the Kent filter.Power consumption is less and purified water is 1 ltr for 2 ltr tap water.

  I recommend don't buy........1 - fake 1 year warranty and 3 year service free .After installation make abnormal sound and highly vibration in Kent RO inner parts ,After many times requested to customer Care no help and no response. Only say \"aapki Puri Shayta ki jayegi ,\"I requested to kent from Kent service app and also from customer Care number but after more then 15 days no service provided .2- price very very high ( same features) then other company and no quality and worst customer Care.3- Kent no free installation, if you call for installation then service person say you must buy prefilter from us and gives price 950 rupye extra. My prefilter buy from Amazon with KENR RO because prefilter recommendation by amazon, service person say you pay 300 rupye extra for your prefilter instaillation and no warranty provide KENT, if you Installation your prefilter ( I call customer care but no more help from Kent service center).4- don't go in brand name and high price because not always right,  brand name and high price.

  The installation request was raised on 16th Dec., however, no one has come to install it, that too even after calling customer care of kent 2-3 times. They assign the installation to one technician, who first told that he can come only between 10:30 AM to 1 PM, which did not match with my office hours, so i requested him to come earlier or in the evening, he didnt agree. I again contacted Kent customer care on Saturday (21 dec.) and requested them to schedule installation at the earliest, they scheduled installation at 3:30 PM same day, however, assigned the installation to the very same person who had been assigned earlier, and as usual he never came. I contacted kent customer care again on Sunday, however, of no use. It has become so difficult to get it installed, had i known it i would have never bought it

  Not filtering properly. Filtered water is containing white thread like particles. No support from customer care side. They are not replacing the faulty parts. Service center technician and owner and Kent Area sales manager all have seen the problem by home visit telling lie to the kent and denying to replace the part . They want me to do Lab test report for the water to get the part replaced.Very BAD SUPPORT from KENT. They don't want to replace the part becoz it is under warranty.NEVER BUY ANYTHING FROM KENT. THEY WILL NOT CHANGE THE PART BECAUSE IT IS UNDER WARRANTY. they will change the parts only when u give them money.

  I used this product from yesterday, so not to put any comments regarding the quality. Delivered on time by ATS, thanks for Amazon but I faced issues whenever I installed the product. After two days later technician came & tell me for purchasing Prefilter (Sediment Filter) which cost is  1650/ & also tell me if I not purchased the Pre-filter he back without installing the product. So I contact the Kent customer service & tell all the issues. After called the helpline I knew the actual price of Prefilter..700/. Nothing happens after lots of conference calld between Kent executive, local dealer & me. Me & my family members was frastete from the brand KENT. As per telephonic discussion with help line they arranged a senior manager call within two hours but write now I am not received any call from KENT HELP LINE CENTRE. Later I feel...this all  things out of my control so I paid 1650 & installed the product. My Local Dealer Name & contact details - GOUTAM PYNE, BANKURA, 8250950073, PIN- 722101, West Bengal.

It has all the same features as this one with that extra feature. As for the UV Lamp, it is not mentioned anywhere on Kent's Website or User Manual but by the looks of it, it does feel like a Stainless Steel Chamber (Do ask the Installation Guy or the Customer Service for the same). This was my Overall Experience for now and I opted than any other brand only because of that 3 years Extended AMC they are offering as opposed to their rivals. Thank You.

  The package was opened by KENT service person and he found that UF Membrane cartridge is broken and bypassed the connection.  Also he discouraged online purchase.  Instead of returning, he suggested to lodge a request via KENT Service App.  But it displays that my phone number is not updated.  At the same time it dispalys my  mobile number and address.  If the company do not replace the item, I have to return the unit for replacement

  Packaging was good.Water tastes good.Better than the previous version in terms of design.Installation was done in a timely manner.Storage indicator available but has no light.Required to buy the extra side filter and the cover for the Kent filter.Power consumption is less and purified water is 1 ltr for 2 ltr tap water.

  I recommend don't buy........1 - fake 1 year warranty and 3 year service free .After installation make abnormal sound and highly vibration in Kent RO inner parts ,After many times requested to customer Care no help and no response. Only say \"aapki Puri Shayta ki jayegi ,\"I requested to kent from Kent service app and also from customer Care number but after more then 15 days no service provided .2- price very very high ( same features) then other company and no quality and worst customer Care.3- Kent no free installation, if you call for installation then service person say you must buy prefilter from us and gives price 950 rupye extra. My prefilter buy from Amazon with KENR RO because prefilter recommendation by amazon, service person say you pay 300 rupye extra for your prefilter instaillation and no warranty provide KENT, if you Installation your prefilter ( I call customer care but no more help from Kent service center).4- don't go in brand name and high price because not always right,  brand name and high price.

  The installation request was raised on 16th Dec., however, no one has come to install it, that too even after calling customer care of kent 2-3 times. They assign the installation to one technician, who first told that he can come only between 10:30 AM to 1 PM, which did not match with my office hours, so i requested him to come earlier or in the evening, he didnt agree. I again contacted Kent customer care on Saturday (21 dec.) and requested them to schedule installation at the earliest, they scheduled installation at 3:30 PM same day, however, assigned the installation to the very same person who had been assigned earlier, and as usual he never came. I contacted kent customer care again on Sunday, however, of no use. It has become so difficult to get it installed, had i known it i would have never bought it

  Not filtering properly. Filtered water is containing white thread like particles. No support from customer care side. They are not replacing the faulty parts. Service center technician and owner and Kent Area sales manager all have seen the problem by home visit telling lie to the kent and denying to replace the part . They want me to do Lab test report for the water to get the part replaced.Very BAD SUPPORT from KENT. They don't want to replace the part becoz it is under warranty.NEVER BUY ANYTHING FROM KENT. THEY WILL NOT CHANGE THE PART BECAUSE IT IS UNDER WARRANTY. they will change the parts only when u give them money.

  I used this product from yesterday, so not to put any comments regarding the quality. Delivered on time by ATS, thanks for Amazon but I faced issues whenever I installed the product. After two days later technician came & tell me for purchasing Prefilter (Sediment Filter) which cost is  1650/ & also tell me if I not purchased the Pre-filter he back without installing the product. So I contact the Kent customer service & tell all the issues. After called the helpline I knew the actual price of Prefilter..700/. Nothing happens after lots of conference calld between Kent executive, local dealer & me. Me & my family members was frastete from the brand KENT. As per telephonic discussion with help line they arranged a senior manager call within two hours but write now I am not received any call from KENT HELP LINE CENTRE. Later I feel...this all  things out of my control so I paid 1650 & installed the product. My Local Dealer Name & contact details - GOUTAM PYNE, BANKURA, 8250950073, PIN- 722101, West Bengal.

  Would have given zero rating if it was possible, i have been a kent customer for years and over the years kents service and product has come down to a such low that its useless, feel cheated after buying this product, my advice do not go for kent products and check for alternatives,The installation is supposedly free, but the service engineer will always push for a pre-filter, this was usual and i have experienced this before so i was ok with it, but now these guys have come up with a new concept of pressure reducing valve and says this avoids the purifier from bursting in case of high pressure and also avoids air getting in, now both of these components seems reasonable and cannot be avoided then why is this not provided by default with the purifier as these are part of safety.All this is not even start, the machine i recieved had wrong internal connection of water flow (not sure wether it was wrong or the installation guy had poor knowledge) so he had to correct it, this shocked me as a purifier which is factory assembled and passed their quality and testing check should not ideally have wrong connection.After all this circus the purifier have started leaking water even after the purifier was powered down, and now i have shut the water line to the purifier so that i can avoid flooding of my apartment, and have come to a realization the poor water taste i was facing was because the water was never getting purified and it was just passing through as is.Now this is a clear case of defective product but kent does not have any return or replacement they can only service and i have to hope that they would fix it.

  I Purchased this Product on July 9, 2020, at around 7 pm and it was delivered on July 12, 2020, around 2 pm. I requested for the Installation as soon as receiving the Product and the Service Guy came within an Hour after calling me for the address info. The purifier was Installed on the same day even though 12th July being a Sunday. I would urge others to request for the Installation and not wait for the Brand to call back as it may take time as they offer service according to the Queue. Also, Speed of Installation or Service may take time as per the Service Provider Availability. In my case, the Installation Work was given to their Authorised Service Centre in my area. The Service Guy himself did everything on his own and the Overall Experience was Satisfactory. He asked me for the Prefilter on the call before coming and told me the price to be 700 ( which may vary with Service Provider) which I agreed. After the installation, he said he changed the Inline Sediment Filter as it was defective but being in warranty it won't cost me a buck. He also asked me for my preferred TDS Level and he suggested to set it at 80. One thing to note is that the TDS level can only be set by the Service Guy with the help of a screw and there's no knob or button available to the end-user. Another thing he told me is that the Warranty for the Sediment and Carbon Filters is 6 months and for other filters and Parts is 1 year, In that period, the Respective Parts will be changed free of cost by the Service Guy himself. After the One Year, Only Service will be Free (Visiting and Maintenance Charges) but the Filters or any other parts have to bear by the Consumer (500-1000 for filters and 2500 for water pump). He also suggested changing the Prefilter every 3 months which will cost around 100-200. For other filters, it may vary according to the Water Consumption and the Water Quality of the Source. Although filters should be changed at least once a year. One Important thing to note before buying this particular product which I completely missed is that Kent New Grand doesn't come with a UV lamp inside Storage Tank, whereas it is present in the Newer Model Kent New Grand Plus. I would highly recommend going for that Model as it is only 1000 rupees (at max) more than this one but the extra UV lamp does ensure there are no bacterias present in the Storage Tank itself after all the Purification has been done ( It comes with a 9L tank as compared to 8L).

  The installation request was raised on 16th Dec., however, no one has come to install it, that too even after calling customer care of kent 2-3 times. They assign the installation to one technician, who first told that he can come only between 10:30 AM to 1 PM, which did not match with my office hours, so i requested him to come earlier or in the evening, he didnt agree. I again contacted Kent customer care on Saturday (21 dec.) and requested them to schedule installation at the earliest, they scheduled installation at 3:30 PM same day, however, assigned the installation to the very same person who had been assigned earlier, and as usual he never came. I contacted kent customer care again on Sunday, however, of no use. It has become so difficult to get it installed, had i known it i would have never bought it

  Not filtering properly. Filtered water is containing white thread like particles. No support from customer care side. They are not replacing the faulty parts. Service center technician and owner and Kent Area sales manager all have seen the problem by home visit telling lie to the kent and denying to replace the part . They want me to do Lab test report for the water to get the part replaced.Very BAD SUPPORT from KENT. They don't want to replace the part becoz it is under warranty.NEVER BUY ANYTHING FROM KENT. THEY WILL NOT CHANGE THE PART BECAUSE IT IS UNDER WARRANTY. they will change the parts only when u give them money.

  I used this product from yesterday, so not to put any comments regarding the quality. Delivered on time by ATS, thanks for Amazon but I faced issues whenever I installed the product. After two days later technician came & tell me for purchasing Prefilter (Sediment Filter) which cost is  1650/ & also tell me if I not purchased the Pre-filter he back without installing the product. So I contact the Kent customer service & tell all the issues. After called the helpline I knew the actual price of Prefilter..700/. Nothing happens after lots of conference calld between Kent executive, local dealer & me. Me & my family members was frastete from the brand KENT. As per telephonic discussion with help line they arranged a senior manager call within two hours but write now I am not received any call from KENT HELP LINE CENTRE. Later I feel...this all  things out of my control so I paid 1650 & installed the product. My Local Dealer Name & contact details - GOUTAM PYNE, BANKURA, 8250950073, PIN- 722101, West Bengal.

  Would have given zero rating if it was possible, i have been a kent customer for years and over the years kents service and product has come down to a such low that its useless, feel cheated after buying this product, my advice do not go for kent products and check for alternatives,The installation is supposedly free, but the service engineer will always push for a pre-filter, this was usual and i have experienced this before so i was ok with it, but now these guys have come up with a new concept of pressure reducing valve and says this avoids the purifier from bursting in case of high pressure and also avoids air getting in, now both of these components seems reasonable and cannot be avoided then why is this not provided by default with the purifier as these are part of safety.All this is not even start, the machine i recieved had wrong internal connection of water flow (not sure wether it was wrong or the installation guy had poor knowledge) so he had to correct it, this shocked me as a purifier which is factory assembled and passed their quality and testing check should not ideally have wrong connection.After all this circus the purifier have started leaking water even after the purifier was powered down, and now i have shut the water line to the purifier so that i can avoid flooding of my apartment, and have come to a realization the poor water taste i was facing was because the water was never getting purified and it was just passing through as is.Now this is a clear case of defective product but kent does not have any return or replacement they can only service and i have to hope that they would fix it.

  I Purchased this Product on July 9, 2020, at around 7 pm and it was delivered on July 12, 2020, around 2 pm. I requested for the Installation as soon as receiving the Product and the Service Guy came within an Hour after calling me for the address info. The purifier was Installed on the same day even though 12th July being a Sunday. I would urge others to request for the Installation and not wait for the Brand to call back as it may take time as they offer service according to the Queue. Also, Speed of Installation or Service may take time as per the Service Provider Availability. In my case, the Installation Work was given to their Authorised Service Centre in my area. The Service Guy himself did everything on his own and the Overall Experience was Satisfactory. He asked me for the Prefilter on the call before coming and told me the price to be 700 ( which may vary with Service Provider) which I agreed. After the installation, he said he changed the Inline Sediment Filter as it was defective but being in warranty it won't cost me a buck. He also asked me for my preferred TDS Level and he suggested to set it at 80. One thing to note is that the TDS level can only be set by the Service Guy with the help of a screw and there's no knob or button available to the end-user. Another thing he told me is that the Warranty for the Sediment and Carbon Filters is 6 months and for other filters and Parts is 1 year, In that period, the Respective Parts will be changed free of cost by the Service Guy himself. After the One Year, Only Service will be Free (Visiting and Maintenance Charges) but the Filters or any other parts have to bear by the Consumer (500-1000 for filters and 2500 for water pump). He also suggested changing the Prefilter every 3 months which will cost around 100-200. For other filters, it may vary according to the Water Consumption and the Water Quality of the Source. Although filters should be changed at least once a year. One Important thing to note before buying this particular product which I completely missed is that Kent New Grand doesn't come with a UV lamp inside Storage Tank, whereas it is present in the Newer Model Kent New Grand Plus. I would highly recommend going for that Model as it is only 1000 rupees (at max) more than this one but the extra UV lamp does ensure there are no bacterias present in the Storage Tank itself after all the Purification has been done ( It comes with a 9L tank as compared to 8L). It has all the same features as this one with that extra feature. As for the UV Lamp, it is not mentioned anywhere on Kent's Website or User Manual but by the looks of it, it does feel like a Stainless Steel Chamber (Do ask the Installation Guy or the Customer Service for the same). This was my Overall Experience for now and I opted than any other brand only because of that 3 years Extended AMC they are offering as opposed to their rivals. Thank You.

  The package was opened by KENT service person and he found that UF Membrane cartridge is broken and bypassed the connection.  Also he discouraged online purchase.  Instead of returning, he suggested to lodge a request via KENT Service App.  But it displays that my phone number is not updated.  At the same time it dispalys my  mobile number and address.  If the company do not replace the item, I have to return the unit for replacement

  Packaging was good.Water tastes good.Better than the previous version in terms of design.Installation was done in a timely manner.Storage indicator available but has no light.Required to buy the extra side filter and the cover for the Kent filter.Power consumption is less and purified water is 1 ltr for 2 ltr tap water.

  I recommend don't buy........1 - fake 1 year warranty and 3 year service free .After installation make abnormal sound and highly vibration in Kent RO inner parts ,After many times requested to customer Care no help and no response. Only say \"aapki Puri Shayta ki jayegi ,\"I requested to kent from Kent service app and also from customer Care number but after more then 15 days no service provided .2- price very very high ( same features) then other company and no quality and worst customer Care.3- Kent no free installation, if you call for installation then service person say you must buy prefilter from us and gives price 950 rupye extra. My prefilter buy from Amazon with KENR RO because prefilter recommendation by amazon, service person say you pay 300 rupye extra for your prefilter instaillation and no warranty provide KENT, if you Installation your prefilter ( I call customer care but no more help from Kent service center).4- don't go in brand name and high price because not always right,  brand name and high price.

  Would have given zero rating if it was possible, i have been a kent customer for years and over the years kents service and product has come down to a such low that its useless, feel cheated after buying this product, my advice do not go for kent products and check for alternatives,The installation is supposedly free, but the service engineer will always push for a pre-filter, this was usual and i have experienced this before so i was ok with it, but now these guys have come up with a new concept of pressure reducing valve and says this avoids the purifier from bursting in case of high pressure and also avoids air getting in, now both of these components seems reasonable and cannot be avoided then why is this not provided by default with the purifier as these are part of safety.All this is not even start, the machine i recieved had wrong internal connection of water flow (not sure wether it was wrong or the installation guy had poor knowledge) so he had to correct it, this shocked me as a purifier which is factory assembled and passed their quality and testing check should not ideally have wrong connection.After all this circus the purifier have started leaking water even after the purifier was powered down, and now i have shut the water line to the purifier so that i can avoid flooding of my apartment, and have come to a realization the poor water taste i was facing was because the water was never getting purified and it was just passing through as is.Now this is a clear case of defective product but kent does not have any return or replacement they can only service and i have to hope that they would fix it.

  I Purchased this Product on July 9, 2020, at around 7 pm and it was delivered on July 12, 2020, around 2 pm. I requested for the Installation as soon as receiving the Product and the Service Guy came within an Hour after calling me for the address info. The purifier was Installed on the same day even though 12th July being a Sunday. I would urge others to request for the Installation and not wait for the Brand to call back as it may take time as they offer service according to the Queue. Also, Speed of Installation or Service may take time as per the Service Provider Availability. In my case, the Installation Work was given to their Authorised Service Centre in my area. The Service Guy himself did everything on his own and the Overall Experience was Satisfactory. He asked me for the Prefilter on the call before coming and told me the price to be 700 ( which may vary with Service Provider) which I agreed. After the installation, he said he changed the Inline Sediment Filter as it was defective but being in warranty it won't cost me a buck. He also asked me for my preferred TDS Level and he suggested to set it at 80. One thing to note is that the TDS level can only be set by the Service Guy with the help of a screw and there's no knob or button available to the end-user. Another thing he told me is that the Warranty for the Sediment and Carbon Filters is 6 months and for other filters and Parts is 1 year, In that period, the Respective Parts will be changed free of cost by the Service Guy himself. After the One Year, Only Service will be Free (Visiting and Maintenance Charges) but the Filters or any other parts have to bear by the Consumer (500-1000 for filters and 2500 for water pump). He also suggested changing the Prefilter every 3 months which will cost around 100-200. For other filters, it may vary according to the Water Consumption and the Water Quality of the Source. Although filters should be changed at least once a year. One Important thing to note before buying this particular product which I completely missed is that Kent New Grand doesn't come with a UV lamp inside Storage Tank, whereas it is present in the Newer Model Kent New Grand Plus. I would highly recommend going for that Model as it is only 1000 rupees (at max) more than this one but the extra UV lamp does ensure there are no bacterias present in the Storage Tank itself after all the Purification has been done ( It comes with a 9L tank as compared to 8L). It has all the same features as this one with that extra feature. As for the UV Lamp, it is not mentioned anywhere on Kent's Website or User Manual but by the looks of it, it does feel like a Stainless Steel Chamber (Do ask the Installation Guy or the Customer Service for the same). This was my Overall Experience for now and I opted than any other brand only because of that 3 years Extended AMC they are offering as opposed to their rivals. Thank You.

  The package was opened by KENT service person and he found that UF Membrane cartridge is broken and bypassed the connection.  Also he discouraged online purchase.  Instead of returning, he suggested to lodge a request via KENT Service App.  But it displays that my phone number is not updated.  At the same time it dispalys my  mobile number and address.  If the company do not replace the item, I have to return the unit for replacement

  Packaging was good.Water tastes good.Better than the previous version in terms of design.Installation was done in a timely manner.Storage indicator available but has no light.Required to buy the extra side filter and the cover for the Kent filter.Power consumption is less and purified water is 1 ltr for 2 ltr tap water.

  I recommend don't buy........1 - fake 1 year warranty and 3 year service free .After installation make abnormal sound and highly vibration in Kent RO inner parts ,After many times requested to customer Care no help and no response. Only say \"aapki Puri Shayta ki jayegi ,\"I requested to kent from Kent service app and also from customer Care number but after more then 15 days no service provided .2- price very very high ( same features) then other company and no quality and worst customer Care.3- Kent no free installation, if you call for installation then service person say you must buy prefilter from us and gives price 950 rupye extra. My prefilter buy from Amazon with KENR RO because prefilter recommendation by amazon, service person say you pay 300 rupye extra for your prefilter instaillation and no warranty provide KENT, if you Installation your prefilter ( I call customer care but no more help from Kent service center).4- don't go in brand name and high price because not always right,  brand name and high price.

  The installation request was raised on 16th Dec., however, no one has come to install it, that too even after calling customer care of kent 2-3 times. They assign the installation to one technician, who first told that he can come only between 10:30 AM to 1 PM, which did not match with my office hours, so i requested him to come earlier or in the evening, he didnt agree. I again contacted Kent customer care on Saturday (21 dec.) and requested them to schedule installation at the earliest, they scheduled installation at 3:30 PM same day, however, assigned the installation to the very same person who had been assigned earlier, and as usual he never came. I contacted kent customer care again on Sunday, however, of no use. It has become so difficult to get it installed, had i known it i would have never bought it

  Not filtering properly. Filtered water is containing white thread like particles. No support from customer care side. They are not replacing the faulty parts. Service center technician and owner and Kent Area sales manager all have seen the problem by home visit telling lie to the kent and denying to replace the part . They want me to do Lab test report for the water to get the part replaced.Very BAD SUPPORT from KENT. They don't want to replace the part becoz it is under warranty.NEVER BUY ANYTHING FROM KENT. THEY WILL NOT CHANGE THE PART BECAUSE IT IS UNDER WARRANTY. they will change the parts only when u give them money.

  I used this product from yesterday, so not to put any comments regarding the quality. Delivered on time by ATS, thanks for Amazon but I faced issues whenever I installed the product. After two days later technician came & tell me for purchasing Prefilter (Sediment Filter) which cost is  1650/ & also tell me if I not purchased the Pre-filter he back without installing the product. So I contact the Kent customer service & tell all the issues. After called the helpline I knew the actual price of Prefilter..700/. Nothing happens after lots of conference calld between Kent executive, local dealer & me. Me & my family members was frastete from the brand KENT. As per telephonic discussion with help line they arranged a senior manager call within two hours but write now I am not received any call from KENT HELP LINE CENTRE. Later I feel...this all  things out of my control so I paid 1650 & installed the product. My Local Dealer Name & contact details - GOUTAM PYNE, BANKURA, 8250950073, PIN- 722101, West Bengal.

It has all the same features as this one with that extra feature. As for the UV Lamp, it is not mentioned anywhere on Kent's Website or User Manual but by the looks of it, it does feel like a Stainless Steel Chamber (Do ask the Installation Guy or the Customer Service for the same). This was my Overall Experience for now and I opted than any other brand only because of that 3 years Extended AMC they are offering as opposed to their rivals. Thank You.

  The package was opened by KENT service person and he found that UF Membrane cartridge is broken and bypassed the connection.  Also he discouraged online purchase.  Instead of returning, he suggested to lodge a request via KENT Service App.  But it displays that my phone number is not updated.  At the same time it dispalys my  mobile number and address.  If the company do not replace the item, I have to return the unit for replacement

  Packaging was good.Water tastes good.Better than the previous version in terms of design.Installation was done in a timely manner.Storage indicator available but has no light.Required to buy the extra side filter and the cover for the Kent filter.Power consumption is less and purified water is 1 ltr for 2 ltr tap water.

  I recommend don't buy........1 - fake 1 year warranty and 3 year service free .After installation make abnormal sound and highly vibration in Kent RO inner parts ,After many times requested to customer Care no help and no response. Only say \"aapki Puri Shayta ki jayegi ,\"I requested to kent from Kent service app and also from customer Care number but after more then 15 days no service provided .2- price very very high ( same features) then other company and no quality and worst customer Care.3- Kent no free installation, if you call for installation then service person say you must buy prefilter from us and gives price 950 rupye extra. My prefilter buy from Amazon with KENR RO because prefilter recommendation by amazon, service person say you pay 300 rupye extra for your prefilter instaillation and no warranty provide KENT, if you Installation your prefilter ( I call customer care but no more help from Kent service center).4- don't go in brand name and high price because not always right,  brand name and high price.

  The installation request was raised on 16th Dec., however, no one has come to install it, that too even after calling customer care of kent 2-3 times. They assign the installation to one technician, who first told that he can come only between 10:30 AM to 1 PM, which did not match with my office hours, so i requested him to come earlier or in the evening, he didnt agree. I again contacted Kent customer care on Saturday (21 dec.) and requested them to schedule installation at the earliest, they scheduled installation at 3:30 PM same day, however, assigned the installation to the very same person who had been assigned earlier, and as usual he never came. I contacted kent customer care again on Sunday, however, of no use. It has become so difficult to get it installed, had i known it i would have never bought it

  Not filtering properly. Filtered water is containing white thread like particles. No support from customer care side. They are not replacing the faulty parts. Service center technician and owner and Kent Area sales manager all have seen the problem by home visit telling lie to the kent and denying to replace the part . They want me to do Lab test report for the water to get the part replaced.Very BAD SUPPORT from KENT. They don't want to replace the part becoz it is under warranty.NEVER BUY ANYTHING FROM KENT. THEY WILL NOT CHANGE THE PART BECAUSE IT IS UNDER WARRANTY. they will change the parts only when u give them money.

  I used this product from yesterday, so not to put any comments regarding the quality. Delivered on time by ATS, thanks for Amazon but I faced issues whenever I installed the product. After two days later technician came & tell me for purchasing Prefilter (Sediment Filter) which cost is  1650/ & also tell me if I not purchased the Pre-filter he back without installing the product. So I contact the Kent customer service & tell all the issues. After called the helpline I knew the actual price of Prefilter..700/. Nothing happens after lots of conference calld between Kent executive, local dealer & me. Me & my family members was frastete from the brand KENT. As per telephonic discussion with help line they arranged a senior manager call within two hours but write now I am not received any call from KENT HELP LINE CENTRE. Later I feel...this all  things out of my control so I paid 1650 & installed the product. My Local Dealer Name & contact details - GOUTAM PYNE, BANKURA, 8250950073, PIN- 722101, West Bengal.

  Would have given zero rating if it was possible, i have been a kent customer for years and over the years kents service and product has come down to a such low that its useless, feel cheated after buying this product, my advice do not go for kent products and check for alternatives,The installation is supposedly free, but the service engineer will always push for a pre-filter, this was usual and i have experienced this before so i was ok with it, but now these guys have come up with a new concept of pressure reducing valve and says this avoids the purifier from bursting in case of high pressure and also avoids air getting in, now both of these components seems reasonable and cannot be avoided then why is this not provided by default with the purifier as these are part of safety.All this is not even start, the machine i recieved had wrong internal connection of water flow (not sure wether it was wrong or the installation guy had poor knowledge) so he had to correct it, this shocked me as a purifier which is factory assembled and passed their quality and testing check should not ideally have wrong connection.After all this circus the purifier have started leaking water even after the purifier was powered down, and now i have shut the water line to the purifier so that i can avoid flooding of my apartment, and have come to a realization the poor water taste i was facing was because the water was never getting purified and it was just passing through as is.Now this is a clear case of defective product but kent does not have any return or replacement they can only service and i have to hope that they would fix it.

  I Purchased this Product on July 9, 2020, at around 7 pm and it was delivered on July 12, 2020, around 2 pm. I requested for the Installation as soon as receiving the Product and the Service Guy came within an Hour after calling me for the address info. The purifier was Installed on the same day even though 12th July being a Sunday. I would urge others to request for the Installation and not wait for the Brand to call back as it may take time as they offer service according to the Queue. Also, Speed of Installation or Service may take time as per the Service Provider Availability. In my case, the Installation Work was given to their Authorised Service Centre in my area. The Service Guy himself did everything on his own and the Overall Experience was Satisfactory. He asked me for the Prefilter on the call before coming and told me the price to be 700 ( which may vary with Service Provider) which I agreed. After the installation, he said he changed the Inline Sediment Filter as it was defective but being in warranty it won't cost me a buck. He also asked me for my preferred TDS Level and he suggested to set it at 80. One thing to note is that the TDS level can only be set by the Service Guy with the help of a screw and there's no knob or button available to the end-user. Another thing he told me is that the Warranty for the Sediment and Carbon Filters is 6 months and for other filters and Parts is 1 year, In that period, the Respective Parts will be changed free of cost by the Service Guy himself. After the One Year, Only Service will be Free (Visiting and Maintenance Charges) but the Filters or any other parts have to bear by the Consumer (500-1000 for filters and 2500 for water pump). He also suggested changing the Prefilter every 3 months which will cost around 100-200. For other filters, it may vary according to the Water Consumption and the Water Quality of the Source. Although filters should be changed at least once a year. One Important thing to note before buying this particular product which I completely missed is that Kent New Grand doesn't come with a UV lamp inside Storage Tank, whereas it is present in the Newer Model Kent New Grand Plus. I would highly recommend going for that Model as it is only 1000 rupees (at max) more than this one but the extra UV lamp does ensure there are no bacterias present in the Storage Tank itself after all the Purification has been done ( It comes with a 9L tank as compared to 8L).

  The installation request was raised on 16th Dec., however, no one has come to install it, that too even after calling customer care of kent 2-3 times. They assign the installation to one technician, who first told that he can come only between 10:30 AM to 1 PM, which did not match with my office hours, so i requested him to come earlier or in the evening, he didnt agree. I again contacted Kent customer care on Saturday (21 dec.) and requested them to schedule installation at the earliest, they scheduled installation at 3:30 PM same day, however, assigned the installation to the very same person who had been assigned earlier, and as usual he never came. I contacted kent customer care again on Sunday, however, of no use. It has become so difficult to get it installed, had i known it i would have never bought it

  Not filtering properly. Filtered water is containing white thread like particles. No support from customer care side. They are not replacing the faulty parts. Service center technician and owner and Kent Area sales manager all have seen the problem by home visit telling lie to the kent and denying to replace the part . They want me to do Lab test report for the water to get the part replaced.Very BAD SUPPORT from KENT. They don't want to replace the part becoz it is under warranty.NEVER BUY ANYTHING FROM KENT. THEY WILL NOT CHANGE THE PART BECAUSE IT IS UNDER WARRANTY. they will change the parts only when u give them money.

  I used this product from yesterday, so not to put any comments regarding the quality. Delivered on time by ATS, thanks for Amazon but I faced issues whenever I installed the product. After two days later technician came & tell me for purchasing Prefilter (Sediment Filter) which cost is  1650/ & also tell me if I not purchased the Pre-filter he back without installing the product. So I contact the Kent customer service & tell all the issues. After called the helpline I knew the actual price of Prefilter..700/. Nothing happens after lots of conference calld between Kent executive, local dealer & me. Me & my family members was frastete from the brand KENT. As per telephonic discussion with help line they arranged a senior manager call within two hours but write now I am not received any call from KENT HELP LINE CENTRE. Later I feel...this all  things out of my control so I paid 1650 & installed the product. My Local Dealer Name & contact details - GOUTAM PYNE, BANKURA, 8250950073, PIN- 722101, West Bengal.

  Would have given zero rating if it was possible, i have been a kent customer for years and over the years kents service and product has come down to a such low that its useless, feel cheated after buying this product, my advice do not go for kent products and check for alternatives,The installation is supposedly free, but the service engineer will always push for a pre-filter, this was usual and i have experienced this before so i was ok with it, but now these guys have come up with a new concept of pressure reducing valve and says this avoids the purifier from bursting in case of high pressure and also avoids air getting in, now both of these components seems reasonable and cannot be avoided then why is this not provided by default with the purifier as these are part of safety.All this is not even start, the machine i recieved had wrong internal connection of water flow (not sure wether it was wrong or the installation guy had poor knowledge) so he had to correct it, this shocked me as a purifier which is factory assembled and passed their quality and testing check should not ideally have wrong connection.After all this circus the purifier have started leaking water even after the purifier was powered down, and now i have shut the water line to the purifier so that i can avoid flooding of my apartment, and have come to a realization the poor water taste i was facing was because the water was never getting purified and it was just passing through as is.Now this is a clear case of defective product but kent does not have any return or replacement they can only service and i have to hope that they would fix it.

  I Purchased this Product on July 9, 2020, at around 7 pm and it was delivered on July 12, 2020, around 2 pm. I requested for the Installation as soon as receiving the Product and the Service Guy came within an Hour after calling me for the address info. The purifier was Installed on the same day even though 12th July being a Sunday. I would urge others to request for the Installation and not wait for the Brand to call back as it may take time as they offer service according to the Queue. Also, Speed of Installation or Service may take time as per the Service Provider Availability. In my case, the Installation Work was given to their Authorised Service Centre in my area. The Service Guy himself did everything on his own and the Overall Experience was Satisfactory. He asked me for the Prefilter on the call before coming and told me the price to be 700 ( which may vary with Service Provider) which I agreed. After the installation, he said he changed the Inline Sediment Filter as it was defective but being in warranty it won't cost me a buck. He also asked me for my preferred TDS Level and he suggested to set it at 80. One thing to note is that the TDS level can only be set by the Service Guy with the help of a screw and there's no knob or button available to the end-user. Another thing he told me is that the Warranty for the Sediment and Carbon Filters is 6 months and for other filters and Parts is 1 year, In that period, the Respective Parts will be changed free of cost by the Service Guy himself. After the One Year, Only Service will be Free (Visiting and Maintenance Charges) but the Filters or any other parts have to bear by the Consumer (500-1000 for filters and 2500 for water pump). He also suggested changing the Prefilter every 3 months which will cost around 100-200. For other filters, it may vary according to the Water Consumption and the Water Quality of the Source. Although filters should be changed at least once a year. One Important thing to note before buying this particular product which I completely missed is that Kent New Grand doesn't come with a UV lamp inside Storage Tank, whereas it is present in the Newer Model Kent New Grand Plus. I would highly recommend going for that Model as it is only 1000 rupees (at max) more than this one but the extra UV lamp does ensure there are no bacterias present in the Storage Tank itself after all the Purification has been done ( It comes with a 9L tank as compared to 8L). It has all the same features as this one with that extra feature. As for the UV Lamp, it is not mentioned anywhere on Kent's Website or User Manual but by the looks of it, it does feel like a Stainless Steel Chamber (Do ask the Installation Guy or the Customer Service for the same). This was my Overall Experience for now and I opted than any other brand only because of that 3 years Extended AMC they are offering as opposed to their rivals. Thank You.

  The package was opened by KENT service person and he found that UF Membrane cartridge is broken and bypassed the connection.  Also he discouraged online purchase.  Instead of returning, he suggested to lodge a request via KENT Service App.  But it displays that my phone number is not updated.  At the same time it dispalys my  mobile number and address.  If the company do not replace the item, I have to return the unit for replacement

  Packaging was good.Water tastes good.Better than the previous version in terms of design.Installation was done in a timely manner.Storage indicator available but has no light.Required to buy the extra side filter and the cover for the Kent filter.Power consumption is less and purified water is 1 ltr for 2 ltr tap water.

  I recommend don't buy........1 - fake 1 year warranty and 3 year service free .After installation make abnormal sound and highly vibration in Kent RO inner parts ,After many times requested to customer Care no help and no response. Only say \"aapki Puri Shayta ki jayegi ,\"I requested to kent from Kent service app and also from customer Care number but after more then 15 days no service provided .2- price very very high ( same features) then other company and no quality and worst customer Care.3- Kent no free installation, if you call for installation then service person say you must buy prefilter from us and gives price 950 rupye extra. My prefilter buy from Amazon with KENR RO because prefilter recommendation by amazon, service person say you pay 300 rupye extra for your prefilter instaillation and no warranty provide KENT, if you Installation your prefilter ( I call customer care but no more help from Kent service center).4- don't go in brand name and high price because not always right,  brand name and high price.

  Would have given zero rating if it was possible, i have been a kent customer for years and over the years kents service and product has come down to a such low that its useless, feel cheated after buying this product, my advice do not go for kent products and check for alternatives,The installation is supposedly free, but the service engineer will always push for a pre-filter, this was usual and i have experienced this before so i was ok with it, but now these guys have come up with a new concept of pressure reducing valve and says this avoids the purifier from bursting in case of high pressure and also avoids air getting in, now both of these components seems reasonable and cannot be avoided then why is this not provided by default with the purifier as these are part of safety.All this is not even start, the machine i recieved had wrong internal connection of water flow (not sure wether it was wrong or the installation guy had poor knowledge) so he had to correct it, this shocked me as a purifier which is factory assembled and passed their quality and testing check should not ideally have wrong connection.After all this circus the purifier have started leaking water even after the purifier was powered down, and now i have shut the water line to the purifier so that i can avoid flooding of my apartment, and have come to a realization the poor water taste i was facing was because the water was never getting purified and it was just passing through as is.Now this is a clear case of defective product but kent does not have any return or replacement they can only service and i have to hope that they would fix it.

  I Purchased this Product on July 9, 2020, at around 7 pm and it was delivered on July 12, 2020, around 2 pm. I requested for the Installation as soon as receiving the Product and the Service Guy came within an Hour after calling me for the address info. The purifier was Installed on the same day even though 12th July being a Sunday. I would urge others to request for the Installation and not wait for the Brand to call back as it may take time as they offer service according to the Queue. Also, Speed of Installation or Service may take time as per the Service Provider Availability. In my case, the Installation Work was given to their Authorised Service Centre in my area. The Service Guy himself did everything on his own and the Overall Experience was Satisfactory. He asked me for the Prefilter on the call before coming and told me the price to be 700 ( which may vary with Service Provider) which I agreed. After the installation, he said he changed the Inline Sediment Filter as it was defective but being in warranty it won't cost me a buck. He also asked me for my preferred TDS Level and he suggested to set it at 80. One thing to note is that the TDS level can only be set by the Service Guy with the help of a screw and there's no knob or button available to the end-user. Another thing he told me is that the Warranty for the Sediment and Carbon Filters is 6 months and for other filters and Parts is 1 year, In that period, the Respective Parts will be changed free of cost by the Service Guy himself. After the One Year, Only Service will be Free (Visiting and Maintenance Charges) but the Filters or any other parts have to bear by the Consumer (500-1000 for filters and 2500 for water pump). He also suggested changing the Prefilter every 3 months which will cost around 100-200. For other filters, it may vary according to the Water Consumption and the Water Quality of the Source. Although filters should be changed at least once a year. One Important thing to note before buying this particular product which I completely missed is that Kent New Grand doesn't come with a UV lamp inside Storage Tank, whereas it is present in the Newer Model Kent New Grand Plus. I would highly recommend going for that Model as it is only 1000 rupees (at max) more than this one but the extra UV lamp does ensure there are no bacterias present in the Storage Tank itself after all the Purification has been done ( It comes with a 9L tank as compared to 8L). It has all the same features as this one with that extra feature. As for the UV Lamp, it is not mentioned anywhere on Kent's Website or User Manual but by the looks of it, it does feel like a Stainless Steel Chamber (Do ask the Installation Guy or the Customer Service for the same). This was my Overall Experience for now and I opted than any other brand only because of that 3 years Extended AMC they are offering as opposed to their rivals. Thank You.

  The package was opened by KENT service person and he found that UF Membrane cartridge is broken and bypassed the connection.  Also he discouraged online purchase.  Instead of returning, he suggested to lodge a request via KENT Service App.  But it displays that my phone number is not updated.  At the same time it dispalys my  mobile number and address.  If the company do not replace the item, I have to return the unit for replacement

  Packaging was good.Water tastes good.Better than the previous version in terms of design.Installation was done in a timely manner.Storage indicator available but has no light.Required to buy the extra side filter and the cover for the Kent filter.Power consumption is less and purified water is 1 ltr for 2 ltr tap water.

  I recommend don't buy........1 - fake 1 year warranty and 3 year service free .After installation make abnormal sound and highly vibration in Kent RO inner parts ,After many times requested to customer Care no help and no response. Only say \"aapki Puri Shayta ki jayegi ,\"I requested to kent from Kent service app and also from customer Care number but after more then 15 days no service provided .2- price very very high ( same features) then other company and no quality and worst customer Care.3- Kent no free installation, if you call for installation then service person say you must buy prefilter from us and gives price 950 rupye extra. My prefilter buy from Amazon with KENR RO because prefilter recommendation by amazon, service person say you pay 300 rupye extra for your prefilter instaillation and no warranty provide KENT, if you Installation your prefilter ( I call customer care but no more help from Kent service center).4- don't go in brand name and high price because not always right,  brand name and high price.

  The installation request was raised on 16th Dec., however, no one has come to install it, that too even after calling customer care of kent 2-3 times. They assign the installation to one technician, who first told that he can come only between 10:30 AM to 1 PM, which did not match with my office hours, so i requested him to come earlier or in the evening, he didnt agree. I again contacted Kent customer care on Saturday (21 dec.) and requested them to schedule installation at the earliest, they scheduled installation at 3:30 PM same day, however, assigned the installation to the very same person who had been assigned earlier, and as usual he never came. I contacted kent customer care again on Sunday, however, of no use. It has become so difficult to get it installed, had i known it i would have never bought it

  Not filtering properly. Filtered water is containing white thread like particles. No support from customer care side. They are not replacing the faulty parts. Service center technician and owner and Kent Area sales manager all have seen the problem by home visit telling lie to the kent and denying to replace the part . They want me to do Lab test report for the water to get the part replaced.Very BAD SUPPORT from KENT. They don't want to replace the part becoz it is under warranty.NEVER BUY ANYTHING FROM KENT. THEY WILL NOT CHANGE THE PART BECAUSE IT IS UNDER WARRANTY. they will change the parts only when u give them money.

  I used this product from yesterday, so not to put any comments regarding the quality. Delivered on time by ATS, thanks for Amazon but I faced issues whenever I installed the product. After two days later technician came & tell me for purchasing Prefilter (Sediment Filter) which cost is  1650/ & also tell me if I not purchased the Pre-filter he back without installing the product. So I contact the Kent customer service & tell all the issues. After called the helpline I knew the actual price of Prefilter..700/. Nothing happens after lots of conference calld between Kent executive, local dealer & me. Me & my family members was frastete from the brand KENT. As per telephonic discussion with help line they arranged a senior manager call within two hours but write now I am not received any call from KENT HELP LINE CENTRE. Later I feel...this all  things out of my control so I paid 1650 & installed the product. My Local Dealer Name & contact details - GOUTAM PYNE, BANKURA, 8250950073, PIN- 722101, West Bengal.

It has all the same features as this one with that extra feature. As for the UV Lamp, it is not mentioned anywhere on Kent's Website or User Manual but by the looks of it, it does feel like a Stainless Steel Chamber (Do ask the Installation Guy or the Customer Service for the same). This was my Overall Experience for now and I opted than any other brand only because of that 3 years Extended AMC they are offering as opposed to their rivals. Thank You.

  The package was opened by KENT service person and he found that UF Membrane cartridge is broken and bypassed the connection.  Also he discouraged online purchase.  Instead of returning, he suggested to lodge a request via KENT Service App.  But it displays that my phone number is not updated.  At the same time it dispalys my  mobile number and address.  If the company do not replace the item, I have to return the unit for replacement

  Packaging was good.Water tastes good.Better than the previous version in terms of design.Installation was done in a timely manner.Storage indicator available but has no light.Required to buy the extra side filter and the cover for the Kent filter.Power consumption is less and purified water is 1 ltr for 2 ltr tap water.

  I recommend don't buy........1 - fake 1 year warranty and 3 year service free .After installation make abnormal sound and highly vibration in Kent RO inner parts ,After many times requested to customer Care no help and no response. Only say \"aapki Puri Shayta ki jayegi ,\"I requested to kent from Kent service app and also from customer Care number but after more then 15 days no service provided .2- price very very high ( same features) then other company and no quality and worst customer Care.3- Kent no free installation, if you call for installation then service person say you must buy prefilter from us and gives price 950 rupye extra. My prefilter buy from Amazon with KENR RO because prefilter recommendation by amazon, service person say you pay 300 rupye extra for your prefilter instaillation and no warranty provide KENT, if you Installation your prefilter ( I call customer care but no more help from Kent service center).4- don't go in brand name and high price because not always right,  brand name and high price.

  The installation request was raised on 16th Dec., however, no one has come to install it, that too even after calling customer care of kent 2-3 times. They assign the installation to one technician, who first told that he can come only between 10:30 AM to 1 PM, which did not match with my office hours, so i requested him to come earlier or in the evening, he didnt agree. I again contacted Kent customer care on Saturday (21 dec.) and requested them to schedule installation at the earliest, they scheduled installation at 3:30 PM same day, however, assigned the installation to the very same person who had been assigned earlier, and as usual he never came. I contacted kent customer care again on Sunday, however, of no use. It has become so difficult to get it installed, had i known it i would have never bought it

  Not filtering properly. Filtered water is containing white thread like particles. No support from customer care side. They are not replacing the faulty parts. Service center technician and owner and Kent Area sales manager all have seen the problem by home visit telling lie to the kent and denying to replace the part . They want me to do Lab test report for the water to get the part replaced.Very BAD SUPPORT from KENT. They don't want to replace the part becoz it is under warranty.NEVER BUY ANYTHING FROM KENT. THEY WILL NOT CHANGE THE PART BECAUSE IT IS UNDER WARRANTY. they will change the parts only when u give them money.

  I used this product from yesterday, so not to put any comments regarding the quality. Delivered on time by ATS, thanks for Amazon but I faced issues whenever I installed the product. After two days later technician came & tell me for purchasing Prefilter (Sediment Filter) which cost is  1650/ & also tell me if I not purchased the Pre-filter he back without installing the product. So I contact the Kent customer service & tell all the issues. After called the helpline I knew the actual price of Prefilter..700/. Nothing happens after lots of conference calld between Kent executive, local dealer & me. Me & my family members was frastete from the brand KENT. As per telephonic discussion with help line they arranged a senior manager call within two hours but write now I am not received any call from KENT HELP LINE CENTRE. Later I feel...this all  things out of my control so I paid 1650 & installed the product. My Local Dealer Name & contact details - GOUTAM PYNE, BANKURA, 8250950073, PIN- 722101, West Bengal.

  Would have given zero rating if it was possible, i have been a kent customer for years and over the years kents service and product has come down to a such low that its useless, feel cheated after buying this product, my advice do not go for kent products and check for alternatives,The installation is supposedly free, but the service engineer will always push for a pre-filter, this was usual and i have experienced this before so i was ok with it, but now these guys have come up with a new concept of pressure reducing valve and says this avoids the purifier from bursting in case of high pressure and also avoids air getting in, now both of these components seems reasonable and cannot be avoided then why is this not provided by default with the purifier as these are part of safety.All this is not even start, the machine i recieved had wrong internal connection of water flow (not sure wether it was wrong or the installation guy had poor knowledge) so he had to correct it, this shocked me as a purifier which is factory assembled and passed their quality and testing check should not ideally have wrong connection.After all this circus the purifier have started leaking water even after the purifier was powered down, and now i have shut the water line to the purifier so that i can avoid flooding of my apartment, and have come to a realization the poor water taste i was facing was because the water was never getting purified and it was just passing through as is.Now this is a clear case of defective product but kent does not have any return or replacement they can only service and i have to hope that they would fix it.

  I Purchased this Product on July 9, 2020, at around 7 pm and it was delivered on July 12, 2020, around 2 pm. I requested for the Installation as soon as receiving the Product and the Service Guy came within an Hour after calling me for the address info. The purifier was Installed on the same day even though 12th July being a Sunday. I would urge others to request for the Installation and not wait for the Brand to call back as it may take time as they offer service according to the Queue. Also, Speed of Installation or Service may take time as per the Service Provider Availability. In my case, the Installation Work was given to their Authorised Service Centre in my area. The Service Guy himself did everything on his own and the Overall Experience was Satisfactory. He asked me for the Prefilter on the call before coming and told me the price to be 700 ( which may vary with Service Provider) which I agreed. After the installation, he said he changed the Inline Sediment Filter as it was defective but being in warranty it won't cost me a buck. He also asked me for my preferred TDS Level and he suggested to set it at 80. One thing to note is that the TDS level can only be set by the Service Guy with the help of a screw and there's no knob or button available to the end-user. Another thing he told me is that the Warranty for the Sediment and Carbon Filters is 6 months and for other filters and Parts is 1 year, In that period, the Respective Parts will be changed free of cost by the Service Guy himself. After the One Year, Only Service will be Free (Visiting and Maintenance Charges) but the Filters or any other parts have to bear by the Consumer (500-1000 for filters and 2500 for water pump). He also suggested changing the Prefilter every 3 months which will cost around 100-200. For other filters, it may vary according to the Water Consumption and the Water Quality of the Source. Although filters should be changed at least once a year. One Important thing to note before buying this particular product which I completely missed is that Kent New Grand doesn't come with a UV lamp inside Storage Tank, whereas it is present in the Newer Model Kent New Grand Plus. I would highly recommend going for that Model as it is only 1000 rupees (at max) more than this one but the extra UV lamp does ensure there are no bacterias present in the Storage Tank itself after all the Purification has been done ( It comes with a 9L tank as compared to 8L).

  The installation request was raised on 16th Dec., however, no one has come to install it, that too even after calling customer care of kent 2-3 times. They assign the installation to one technician, who first told that he can come only between 10:30 AM to 1 PM, which did not match with my office hours, so i requested him to come earlier or in the evening, he didnt agree. I again contacted Kent customer care on Saturday (21 dec.) and requested them to schedule installation at the earliest, they scheduled installation at 3:30 PM same day, however, assigned the installation to the very same person who had been assigned earlier, and as usual he never came. I contacted kent customer care again on Sunday, however, of no use. It has become so difficult to get it installed, had i known it i would have never bought it

  Not filtering properly. Filtered water is containing white thread like particles. No support from customer care side. They are not replacing the faulty parts. Service center technician and owner and Kent Area sales manager all have seen the problem by home visit telling lie to the kent and denying to replace the part . They want me to do Lab test report for the water to get the part replaced.Very BAD SUPPORT from KENT. They don't want to replace the part becoz it is under warranty.NEVER BUY ANYTHING FROM KENT. THEY WILL NOT CHANGE THE PART BECAUSE IT IS UNDER WARRANTY. they will change the parts only when u give them money.

  I used this product from yesterday, so not to put any comments regarding the quality. Delivered on time by ATS, thanks for Amazon but I faced issues whenever I installed the product. After two days later technician came & tell me for purchasing Prefilter (Sediment Filter) which cost is  1650/ & also tell me if I not purchased the Pre-filter he back without installing the product. So I contact the Kent customer service & tell all the issues. After called the helpline I knew the actual price of Prefilter..700/. Nothing happens after lots of conference calld between Kent executive, local dealer & me. Me & my family members was frastete from the brand KENT. As per telephonic discussion with help line they arranged a senior manager call within two hours but write now I am not received any call from KENT HELP LINE CENTRE. Later I feel...this all  things out of my control so I paid 1650 & installed the product. My Local Dealer Name & contact details - GOUTAM PYNE, BANKURA, 8250950073, PIN- 722101, West Bengal.

  Would have given zero rating if it was possible, i have been a kent customer for years and over the years kents service and product has come down to a such low that its useless, feel cheated after buying this product, my advice do not go for kent products and check for alternatives,The installation is supposedly free, but the service engineer will always push for a pre-filter, this was usual and i have experienced this before so i was ok with it, but now these guys have come up with a new concept of pressure reducing valve and says this avoids the purifier from bursting in case of high pressure and also avoids air getting in, now both of these components seems reasonable and cannot be avoided then why is this not provided by default with the purifier as these are part of safety.All this is not even start, the machine i recieved had wrong internal connection of water flow (not sure wether it was wrong or the installation guy had poor knowledge) so he had to correct it, this shocked me as a purifier which is factory assembled and passed their quality and testing check should not ideally have wrong connection.After all this circus the purifier have started leaking water even after the purifier was powered down, and now i have shut the water line to the purifier so that i can avoid flooding of my apartment, and have come to a realization the poor water taste i was facing was because the water was never getting purified and it was just passing through as is.Now this is a clear case of defective product but kent does not have any return or replacement they can only service and i have to hope that they would fix it.

  I Purchased this Product on July 9, 2020, at around 7 pm and it was delivered on July 12, 2020, around 2 pm. I requested for the Installation as soon as receiving the Product and the Service Guy came within an Hour after calling me for the address info. The purifier was Installed on the same day even though 12th July being a Sunday. I would urge others to request for the Installation and not wait for the Brand to call back as it may take time as they offer service according to the Queue. Also, Speed of Installation or Service may take time as per the Service Provider Availability. In my case, the Installation Work was given to their Authorised Service Centre in my area. The Service Guy himself did everything on his own and the Overall Experience was Satisfactory. He asked me for the Prefilter on the call before coming and told me the price to be 700 ( which may vary with Service Provider) which I agreed. After the installation, he said he changed the Inline Sediment Filter as it was defective but being in warranty it won't cost me a buck. He also asked me for my preferred TDS Level and he suggested to set it at 80. One thing to note is that the TDS level can only be set by the Service Guy with the help of a screw and there's no knob or button available to the end-user. Another thing he told me is that the Warranty for the Sediment and Carbon Filters is 6 months and for other filters and Parts is 1 year, In that period, the Respective Parts will be changed free of cost by the Service Guy himself. After the One Year, Only Service will be Free (Visiting and Maintenance Charges) but the Filters or any other parts have to bear by the Consumer (500-1000 for filters and 2500 for water pump). He also suggested changing the Prefilter every 3 months which will cost around 100-200. For other filters, it may vary according to the Water Consumption and the Water Quality of the Source. Although filters should be changed at least once a year. One Important thing to note before buying this particular product which I completely missed is that Kent New Grand doesn't come with a UV lamp inside Storage Tank, whereas it is present in the Newer Model Kent New Grand Plus. I would highly recommend going for that Model as it is only 1000 rupees (at max) more than this one but the extra UV lamp does ensure there are no bacterias present in the Storage Tank itself after all the Purification has been done ( It comes with a 9L tank as compared to 8L). It has all the same features as this one with that extra feature. As for the UV Lamp, it is not mentioned anywhere on Kent's Website or User Manual but by the looks of it, it does feel like a Stainless Steel Chamber (Do ask the Installation Guy or the Customer Service for the same). This was my Overall Experience for now and I opted than any other brand only because of that 3 years Extended AMC they are offering as opposed to their rivals. Thank You.

  The package was opened by KENT service person and he found that UF Membrane cartridge is broken and bypassed the connection.  Also he discouraged online purchase.  Instead of returning, he suggested to lodge a request via KENT Service App.  But it displays that my phone number is not updated.  At the same time it dispalys my  mobile number and address.  If the company do not replace the item, I have to return the unit for replacement

  Packaging was good.Water tastes good.Better than the previous version in terms of design.Installation was done in a timely manner.Storage indicator available but has no light.Required to buy the extra side filter and the cover for the Kent filter.Power consumption is less and purified water is 1 ltr for 2 ltr tap water.

  I recommend don't buy........1 - fake 1 year warranty and 3 year service free .After installation make abnormal sound and highly vibration in Kent RO inner parts ,After many times requested to customer Care no help and no response. Only say \"aapki Puri Shayta ki jayegi ,\"I requested to kent from Kent service app and also from customer Care number but after more then 15 days no service provided .2- price very very high ( same features) then other company and no quality and worst customer Care.3- Kent no free installation, if you call for installation then service person say you must buy prefilter from us and gives price 950 rupye extra. My prefilter buy from Amazon with KENR RO because prefilter recommendation by amazon, service person say you pay 300 rupye extra for your prefilter instaillation and no warranty provide KENT, if you Installation your prefilter ( I call customer care but no more help from Kent service center).4- don't go in brand name and high price because not always right,  brand name and high price.

  Would have given zero rating if it was possible, i have been a kent customer for years and over the years kents service and product has come down to a such low that its useless, feel cheated after buying this product, my advice do not go for kent products and check for alternatives,The installation is supposedly free, but the service engineer will always push for a pre-filter, this was usual and i have experienced this before so i was ok with it, but now these guys have come up with a new concept of pressure reducing valve and says this avoids the purifier from bursting in case of high pressure and also avoids air getting in, now both of these components seems reasonable and cannot be avoided then why is this not provided by default with the purifier as these are part of safety.All this is not even start, the machine i recieved had wrong internal connection of water flow (not sure wether it was wrong or the installation guy had poor knowledge) so he had to correct it, this shocked me as a purifier which is factory assembled and passed their quality and testing check should not ideally have wrong connection.After all this circus the purifier have started leaking water even after the purifier was powered down, and now i have shut the water line to the purifier so that i can avoid flooding of my apartment, and have come to a realization the poor water taste i was facing was because the water was never getting purified and it was just passing through as is.Now this is a clear case of defective product but kent does not have any return or replacement they can only service and i have to hope that they would fix it.

  I Purchased this Product on July 9, 2020, at around 7 pm and it was delivered on July 12, 2020, around 2 pm. I requested for the Installation as soon as receiving the Product and the Service Guy came within an Hour after calling me for the address info. The purifier was Installed on the same day even though 12th July being a Sunday. I would urge others to request for the Installation and not wait for the Brand to call back as it may take time as they offer service according to the Queue. Also, Speed of Installation or Service may take time as per the Service Provider Availability. In my case, the Installation Work was given to their Authorised Service Centre in my area. The Service Guy himself did everything on his own and the Overall Experience was Satisfactory. He asked me for the Prefilter on the call before coming and told me the price to be 700 ( which may vary with Service Provider) which I agreed. After the installation, he said he changed the Inline Sediment Filter as it was defective but being in warranty it won't cost me a buck. He also asked me for my preferred TDS Level and he suggested to set it at 80. One thing to note is that the TDS level can only be set by the Service Guy with the help of a screw and there's no knob or button available to the end-user. Another thing he told me is that the Warranty for the Sediment and Carbon Filters is 6 months and for other filters and Parts is 1 year, In that period, the Respective Parts will be changed free of cost by the Service Guy himself. After the One Year, Only Service will be Free (Visiting and Maintenance Charges) but the Filters or any other parts have to bear by the Consumer (500-1000 for filters and 2500 for water pump). He also suggested changing the Prefilter every 3 months which will cost around 100-200. For other filters, it may vary according to the Water Consumption and the Water Quality of the Source. Although filters should be changed at least once a year. One Important thing to note before buying this particular product which I completely missed is that Kent New Grand doesn't come with a UV lamp inside Storage Tank, whereas it is present in the Newer Model Kent New Grand Plus. I would highly recommend going for that Model as it is only 1000 rupees (at max) more than this one but the extra UV lamp does ensure there are no bacterias present in the Storage Tank itself after all the Purification has been done ( It comes with a 9L tank as compared to 8L). It has all the same features as this one with that extra feature. As for the UV Lamp, it is not mentioned anywhere on Kent's Website or User Manual but by the looks of it, it does feel like a Stainless Steel Chamber (Do ask the Installation Guy or the Customer Service for the same). This was my Overall Experience for now and I opted than any other brand only because of that 3 years Extended AMC they are offering as opposed to their rivals. Thank You.

  The package was opened by KENT service person and he found that UF Membrane cartridge is broken and bypassed the connection.  Also he discouraged online purchase.  Instead of returning, he suggested to lodge a request via KENT Service App.  But it displays that my phone number is not updated.  At the same time it dispalys my  mobile number and address.  If the company do not replace the item, I have to return the unit for replacement

  Packaging was good.Water tastes good.Better than the previous version in terms of design.Installation was done in a timely manner.Storage indicator available but has no light.Required to buy the extra side filter and the cover for the Kent filter.Power consumption is less and purified water is 1 ltr for 2 ltr tap water.

  I recommend don't buy........1 - fake 1 year warranty and 3 year service free .After installation make abnormal sound and highly vibration in Kent RO inner parts ,After many times requested to customer Care no help and no response. Only say \"aapki Puri Shayta ki jayegi ,\"I requested to kent from Kent service app and also from customer Care number but after more then 15 days no service provided .2- price very very high ( same features) then other company and no quality and worst customer Care.3- Kent no free installation, if you call for installation then service person say you must buy prefilter from us and gives price 950 rupye extra. My prefilter buy from Amazon with KENR RO because prefilter recommendation by amazon, service person say you pay 300 rupye extra for your prefilter instaillation and no warranty provide KENT, if you Installation your prefilter ( I call customer care but no more help from Kent service center).4- don't go in brand name and high price because not always right,  brand name and high price.

  The installation request was raised on 16th Dec., however, no one has come to install it, that too even after calling customer care of kent 2-3 times. They assign the installation to one technician, who first told that he can come only between 10:30 AM to 1 PM, which did not match with my office hours, so i requested him to come earlier or in the evening, he didnt agree. I again contacted Kent customer care on Saturday (21 dec.) and requested them to schedule installation at the earliest, they scheduled installation at 3:30 PM same day, however, assigned the installation to the very same person who had been assigned earlier, and as usual he never came. I contacted kent customer care again on Sunday, however, of no use. It has become so difficult to get it installed, had i known it i would have never bought it

  Not filtering properly. Filtered water is containing white thread like particles. No support from customer care side. They are not replacing the faulty parts. Service center technician and owner and Kent Area sales manager all have seen the problem by home visit telling lie to the kent and denying to replace the part . They want me to do Lab test report for the water to get the part replaced.Very BAD SUPPORT from KENT. They don't want to replace the part becoz it is under warranty.NEVER BUY ANYTHING FROM KENT. THEY WILL NOT CHANGE THE PART BECAUSE IT IS UNDER WARRANTY. they will change the parts only when u give them money.

  I used this product from yesterday, so not to put any comments regarding the quality. Delivered on time by ATS, thanks for Amazon but I faced issues whenever I installed the product. After two days later technician came & tell me for purchasing Prefilter (Sediment Filter) which cost is  1650/ & also tell me if I not purchased the Pre-filter he back without installing the product. So I contact the Kent customer service & tell all the issues. After called the helpline I knew the actual price of Prefilter..700/. Nothing happens after lots of conference calld between Kent executive, local dealer & me. Me & my family members was frastete from the brand KENT. As per telephonic discussion with help line they arranged a senior manager call within two hours but write now I am not received any call from KENT HELP LINE CENTRE. Later I feel...this all  things out of my control so I paid 1650 & installed the product. My Local Dealer Name & contact details - GOUTAM PYNE, BANKURA, 8250950073, PIN- 722101, West Bengal.

It has all the same features as this one with that extra feature. As for the UV Lamp, it is not mentioned anywhere on Kent's Website or User Manual but by the looks of it, it does feel like a Stainless Steel Chamber (Do ask the Installation Guy or the Customer Service for the same). This was my Overall Experience for now and I opted than any other brand only because of that 3 years Extended AMC they are offering as opposed to their rivals. Thank You.

  The package was opened by KENT service person and he found that UF Membrane cartridge is broken and bypassed the connection.  Also he discouraged online purchase.  Instead of returning, he suggested to lodge a request via KENT Service App.  But it displays that my phone number is not updated.  At the same time it dispalys my  mobile number and address.  If the company do not replace the item, I have to return the unit for replacement

  Packaging was good.Water tastes good.Better than the previous version in terms of design.Installation was done in a timely manner.Storage indicator available but has no light.Required to buy the extra side filter and the cover for the Kent filter.Power consumption is less and purified water is 1 ltr for 2 ltr tap water.

  I recommend don't buy........1 - fake 1 year warranty and 3 year service free .After installation make abnormal sound and highly vibration in Kent RO inner parts ,After many times requested to customer Care no help and no response. Only say \"aapki Puri Shayta ki jayegi ,\"I requested to kent from Kent service app and also from customer Care number but after more then 15 days no service provided .2- price very very high ( same features) then other company and no quality and worst customer Care.3- Kent no free installation, if you call for installation then service person say you must buy prefilter from us and gives price 950 rupye extra. My prefilter buy from Amazon with KENR RO because prefilter recommendation by amazon, service person say you pay 300 rupye extra for your prefilter instaillation and no warranty provide KENT, if you Installation your prefilter ( I call customer care but no more help from Kent service center).4- don't go in brand name and high price because not always right,  brand name and high price.

  The installation request was raised on 16th Dec., however, no one has come to install it, that too even after calling customer care of kent 2-3 times. They assign the installation to one technician, who first told that he can come only between 10:30 AM to 1 PM, which did not match with my office hours, so i requested him to come earlier or in the evening, he didnt agree. I again contacted Kent customer care on Saturday (21 dec.) and requested them to schedule installation at the earliest, they scheduled installation at 3:30 PM same day, however, assigned the installation to the very same person who had been assigned earlier, and as usual he never came. I contacted kent customer care again on Sunday, however, of no use. It has become so difficult to get it installed, had i known it i would have never bought it

  Not filtering properly. Filtered water is containing white thread like particles. No support from customer care side. They are not replacing the faulty parts. Service center technician and owner and Kent Area sales manager all have seen the problem by home visit telling lie to the kent and denying to replace the part . They want me to do Lab test report for the water to get the part replaced.Very BAD SUPPORT from KENT. They don't want to replace the part becoz it is under warranty.NEVER BUY ANYTHING FROM KENT. THEY WILL NOT CHANGE THE PART BECAUSE IT IS UNDER WARRANTY. they will change the parts only when u give them money.

  I used this product from yesterday, so not to put any comments regarding the quality. Delivered on time by ATS, thanks for Amazon but I faced issues whenever I installed the product. After two days later technician came & tell me for purchasing Prefilter (Sediment Filter) which cost is  1650/ & also tell me if I not purchased the Pre-filter he back without installing the product. So I contact the Kent customer service & tell all the issues. After called the helpline I knew the actual price of Prefilter..700/. Nothing happens after lots of conference calld between Kent executive, local dealer & me. Me & my family members was frastete from the brand KENT. As per telephonic discussion with help line they arranged a senior manager call within two hours but write now I am not received any call from KENT HELP LINE CENTRE. Later I feel...this all  things out of my control so I paid 1650 & installed the product. My Local Dealer Name & contact details - GOUTAM PYNE, BANKURA, 8250950073, PIN- 722101, West Bengal.

  Would have given zero rating if it was possible, i have been a kent customer for years and over the years kents service and product has come down to a such low that its useless, feel cheated after buying this product, my advice do not go for kent products and check for alternatives,The installation is supposedly free, but the service engineer will always push for a pre-filter, this was usual and i have experienced this before so i was ok with it, but now these guys have come up with a new concept of pressure reducing valve and says this avoids the purifier from bursting in case of high pressure and also avoids air getting in, now both of these components seems reasonable and cannot be avoided then why is this not provided by default with the purifier as these are part of safety.All this is not even start, the machine i recieved had wrong internal connection of water flow (not sure wether it was wrong or the installation guy had poor knowledge) so he had to correct it, this shocked me as a purifier which is factory assembled and passed their quality and testing check should not ideally have wrong connection.After all this circus the purifier have started leaking water even after the purifier was powered down, and now i have shut the water line to the purifier so that i can avoid flooding of my apartment, and have come to a realization the poor water taste i was facing was because the water was never getting purified and it was just passing through as is.Now this is a clear case of defective product but kent does not have any return or replacement they can only service and i have to hope that they would fix it.

  I Purchased this Product on July 9, 2020, at around 7 pm and it was delivered on July 12, 2020, around 2 pm. I requested for the Installation as soon as receiving the Product and the Service Guy came within an Hour after calling me for the address info. The purifier was Installed on the same day even though 12th July being a Sunday. I would urge others to request for the Installation and not wait for the Brand to call back as it may take time as they offer service according to the Queue. Also, Speed of Installation or Service may take time as per the Service Provider Availability. In my case, the Installation Work was given to their Authorised Service Centre in my area. The Service Guy himself did everything on his own and the Overall Experience was Satisfactory. He asked me for the Prefilter on the call before coming and told me the price to be 700 ( which may vary with Service Provider) which I agreed. After the installation, he said he changed the Inline Sediment Filter as it was defective but being in warranty it won't cost me a buck. He also asked me for my preferred TDS Level and he suggested to set it at 80. One thing to note is that the TDS level can only be set by the Service Guy with the help of a screw and there's no knob or button available to the end-user. Another thing he told me is that the Warranty for the Sediment and Carbon Filters is 6 months and for other filters and Parts is 1 year, In that period, the Respective Parts will be changed free of cost by the Service Guy himself. After the One Year, Only Service will be Free (Visiting and Maintenance Charges) but the Filters or any other parts have to bear by the Consumer (500-1000 for filters and 2500 for water pump). He also suggested changing the Prefilter every 3 months which will cost around 100-200. For other filters, it may vary according to the Water Consumption and the Water Quality of the Source. Although filters should be changed at least once a year. One Important thing to note before buying this particular product which I completely missed is that Kent New Grand doesn't come with a UV lamp inside Storage Tank, whereas it is present in the Newer Model Kent New Grand Plus. I would highly recommend going for that Model as it is only 1000 rupees (at max) more than this one but the extra UV lamp does ensure there are no bacterias present in the Storage Tank itself after all the Purification has been done ( It comes with a 9L tank as compared to 8L).

  The installation request was raised on 16th Dec., however, no one has come to install it, that too even after calling customer care of kent 2-3 times. They assign the installation to one technician, who first told that he can come only between 10:30 AM to 1 PM, which did not match with my office hours, so i requested him to come earlier or in the evening, he didnt agree. I again contacted Kent customer care on Saturday (21 dec.) and requested them to schedule installation at the earliest, they scheduled installation at 3:30 PM same day, however, assigned the installation to the very same person who had been assigned earlier, and as usual he never came. I contacted kent customer care again on Sunday, however, of no use. It has become so difficult to get it installed, had i known it i would have never bought it

  Not filtering properly. Filtered water is containing white thread like particles. No support from customer care side. They are not replacing the faulty parts. Service center technician and owner and Kent Area sales manager all have seen the problem by home visit telling lie to the kent and denying to replace the part . They want me to do Lab test report for the water to get the part replaced.Very BAD SUPPORT from KENT. They don't want to replace the part becoz it is under warranty.NEVER BUY ANYTHING FROM KENT. THEY WILL NOT CHANGE THE PART BECAUSE IT IS UNDER WARRANTY. they will change the parts only when u give them money.

  I used this product from yesterday, so not to put any comments regarding the quality. Delivered on time by ATS, thanks for Amazon but I faced issues whenever I installed the product. After two days later technician came & tell me for purchasing Prefilter (Sediment Filter) which cost is  1650/ & also tell me if I not purchased the Pre-filter he back without installing the product. So I contact the Kent customer service & tell all the issues. After called the helpline I knew the actual price of Prefilter..700/. Nothing happens after lots of conference calld between Kent executive, local dealer & me. Me & my family members was frastete from the brand KENT. As per telephonic discussion with help line they arranged a senior manager call within two hours but write now I am not received any call from KENT HELP LINE CENTRE. Later I feel...this all  things out of my control so I paid 1650 & installed the product. My Local Dealer Name & contact details - GOUTAM PYNE, BANKURA, 8250950073, PIN- 722101, West Bengal.

  Would have given zero rating if it was possible, i have been a kent customer for years and over the years kents service and product has come down to a such low that its useless, feel cheated after buying this product, my advice do not go for kent products and check for alternatives,The installation is supposedly free, but the service engineer will always push for a pre-filter, this was usual and i have experienced this before so i was ok with it, but now these guys have come up with a new concept of pressure reducing valve and says this avoids the purifier from bursting in case of high pressure and also avoids air getting in, now both of these components seems reasonable and cannot be avoided then why is this not provided by default with the purifier as these are part of safety.All this is not even start, the machine i recieved had wrong internal connection of water flow (not sure wether it was wrong or the installation guy had poor knowledge) so he had to correct it, this shocked me as a purifier which is factory assembled and passed their quality and testing check should not ideally have wrong connection.After all this circus the purifier have started leaking water even after the purifier was powered down, and now i have shut the water line to the purifier so that i can avoid flooding of my apartment, and have come to a realization the poor water taste i was facing was because the water was never getting purified and it was just passing through as is.Now this is a clear case of defective product but kent does not have any return or replacement they can only service and i have to hope that they would fix it.

  I Purchased this Product on July 9, 2020, at around 7 pm and it was delivered on July 12, 2020, around 2 pm. I requested for the Installation as soon as receiving the Product and the Service Guy came within an Hour after calling me for the address info. The purifier was Installed on the same day even though 12th July being a Sunday. I would urge others to request for the Installation and not wait for the Brand to call back as it may take time as they offer service according to the Queue. Also, Speed of Installation or Service may take time as per the Service Provider Availability. In my case, the Installation Work was given to their Authorised Service Centre in my area. The Service Guy himself did everything on his own and the Overall Experience was Satisfactory. He asked me for the Prefilter on the call before coming and told me the price to be 700 ( which may vary with Service Provider) which I agreed. After the installation, he said he changed the Inline Sediment Filter as it was defective but being in warranty it won't cost me a buck. He also asked me for my preferred TDS Level and he suggested to set it at 80. One thing to note is that the TDS level can only be set by the Service Guy with the help of a screw and there's no knob or button available to the end-user. Another thing he told me is that the Warranty for the Sediment and Carbon Filters is 6 months and for other filters and Parts is 1 year, In that period, the Respective Parts will be changed free of cost by the Service Guy himself. After the One Year, Only Service will be Free (Visiting and Maintenance Charges) but the Filters or any other parts have to bear by the Consumer (500-1000 for filters and 2500 for water pump). He also suggested changing the Prefilter every 3 months which will cost around 100-200. For other filters, it may vary according to the Water Consumption and the Water Quality of the Source. Although filters should be changed at least once a year. One Important thing to note before buying this particular product which I completely missed is that Kent New Grand doesn't come with a UV lamp inside Storage Tank, whereas it is present in the Newer Model Kent New Grand Plus. I would highly recommend going for that Model as it is only 1000 rupees (at max) more than this one but the extra UV lamp does ensure there are no bacterias present in the Storage Tank itself after all the Purification has been done ( It comes with a 9L tank as compared to 8L). It has all the same features as this one with that extra feature. As for the UV Lamp, it is not mentioned anywhere on Kent's Website or User Manual but by the looks of it, it does feel like a Stainless Steel Chamber (Do ask the Installation Guy or the Customer Service for the same). This was my Overall Experience for now and I opted than any other brand only because of that 3 years Extended AMC they are offering as opposed to their rivals. Thank You.

  The package was opened by KENT service person and he found that UF Membrane cartridge is broken and bypassed the connection.  Also he discouraged online purchase.  Instead of returning, he suggested to lodge a request via KENT Service App.  But it displays that my phone number is not updated.  At the same time it dispalys my  mobile number and address.  If the company do not replace the item, I have to return the unit for replacement

  Packaging was good.Water tastes good.Better than the previous version in terms of design.Installation was done in a timely manner.Storage indicator available but has no light.Required to buy the extra side filter and the cover for the Kent filter.Power consumption is less and purified water is 1 ltr for 2 ltr tap water.

  I recommend don't buy........1 - fake 1 year warranty and 3 year service free .After installation make abnormal sound and highly vibration in Kent RO inner parts ,After many times requested to customer Care no help and no response. Only say \"aapki Puri Shayta ki jayegi ,\"I requested to kent from Kent service app and also from customer Care number but after more then 15 days no service provided .2- price very very high ( same features) then other company and no quality and worst customer Care.3- Kent no free installation, if you call for installation then service person say you must buy prefilter from us and gives price 950 rupye extra. My prefilter buy from Amazon with KENR RO because prefilter recommendation by amazon, service person say you pay 300 rupye extra for your prefilter instaillation and no warranty provide KENT, if you Installation your prefilter ( I call customer care but no more help from Kent service center).4- don't go in brand name and high price because not always right,  brand name and high price.

  Would have given zero rating if it was possible, i have been a kent customer for years and over the years kents service and product has come down to a such low that its useless, feel cheated after buying this product, my advice do not go for kent products and check for alternatives,The installation is supposedly free, but the service engineer will always push for a pre-filter, this was usual and i have experienced this before so i was ok with it, but now these guys have come up with a new concept of pressure reducing valve and says this avoids the purifier from bursting in case of high pressure and also avoids air getting in, now both of these components seems reasonable and cannot be avoided then why is this not provided by default with the purifier as these are part of safety.All this is not even start, the machine i recieved had wrong internal connection of water flow (not sure wether it was wrong or the installation guy had poor knowledge) so he had to correct it, this shocked me as a purifier which is factory assembled and passed their quality and testing check should not ideally have wrong connection.After all this circus the purifier have started leaking water even after the purifier was powered down, and now i have shut the water line to the purifier so that i can avoid flooding of my apartment, and have come to a realization the poor water taste i was facing was because the water was never getting purified and it was just passing through as is.Now this is a clear case of defective product but kent does not have any return or replacement they can only service and i have to hope that they would fix it.

  I Purchased this Product on July 9, 2020, at around 7 pm and it was delivered on July 12, 2020, around 2 pm. I requested for the Installation as soon as receiving the Product and the Service Guy came within an Hour after calling me for the address info. The purifier was Installed on the same day even though 12th July being a Sunday. I would urge others to request for the Installation and not wait for the Brand to call back as it may take time as they offer service according to the Queue. Also, Speed of Installation or Service may take time as per the Service Provider Availability. In my case, the Installation Work was given to their Authorised Service Centre in my area. The Service Guy himself did everything on his own and the Overall Experience was Satisfactory. He asked me for the Prefilter on the call before coming and told me the price to be 700 ( which may vary with Service Provider) which I agreed. After the installation, he said he changed the Inline Sediment Filter as it was defective but being in warranty it won't cost me a buck. He also asked me for my preferred TDS Level and he suggested to set it at 80. One thing to note is that the TDS level can only be set by the Service Guy with the help of a screw and there's no knob or button available to the end-user. Another thing he told me is that the Warranty for the Sediment and Carbon Filters is 6 months and for other filters and Parts is 1 year, In that period, the Respective Parts will be changed free of cost by the Service Guy himself. After the One Year, Only Service will be Free (Visiting and Maintenance Charges) but the Filters or any other parts have to bear by the Consumer (500-1000 for filters and 2500 for water pump). He also suggested changing the Prefilter every 3 months which will cost around 100-200. For other filters, it may vary according to the Water Consumption and the Water Quality of the Source. Although filters should be changed at least once a year. One Important thing to note before buying this particular product which I completely missed is that Kent New Grand doesn't come with a UV lamp inside Storage Tank, whereas it is present in the Newer Model Kent New Grand Plus. I would highly recommend going for that Model as it is only 1000 rupees (at max) more than this one but the extra UV lamp does ensure there are no bacterias present in the Storage Tank itself after all the Purification has been done ( It comes with a 9L tank as compared to 8L). It has all the same features as this one with that extra feature. As for the UV Lamp, it is not mentioned anywhere on Kent's Website or User Manual but by the looks of it, it does feel like a Stainless Steel Chamber (Do ask the Installation Guy or the Customer Service for the same). This was my Overall Experience for now and I opted than any other brand only because of that 3 years Extended AMC they are offering as opposed to their rivals. Thank You.

  The package was opened by KENT service person and he found that UF Membrane cartridge is broken and bypassed the connection.  Also he discouraged online purchase.  Instead of returning, he suggested to lodge a request via KENT Service App.  But it displays that my phone number is not updated.  At the same time it dispalys my  mobile number and address.  If the company do not replace the item, I have to return the unit for replacement

  Packaging was good.Water tastes good.Better than the previous version in terms of design.Installation was done in a timely manner.Storage indicator available but has no light.Required to buy the extra side filter and the cover for the Kent filter.Power consumption is less and purified water is 1 ltr for 2 ltr tap water.

  I recommend don't buy........1 - fake 1 year warranty and 3 year service free .After installation make abnormal sound and highly vibration in Kent RO inner parts ,After many times requested to customer Care no help and no response. Only say \"aapki Puri Shayta ki jayegi ,\"I requested to kent from Kent service app and also from customer Care number but after more then 15 days no service provided .2- price very very high ( same features) then other company and no quality and worst customer Care.3- Kent no free installation, if you call for installation then service person say you must buy prefilter from us and gives price 950 rupye extra. My prefilter buy from Amazon with KENR RO because prefilter recommendation by amazon, service person say you pay 300 rupye extra for your prefilter instaillation and no warranty provide KENT, if you Installation your prefilter ( I call customer care but no more help from Kent service center).4- don't go in brand name and high price because not always right,  brand name and high price.

  The installation request was raised on 16th Dec., however, no one has come to install it, that too even after calling customer care of kent 2-3 times. They assign the installation to one technician, who first told that he can come only between 10:30 AM to 1 PM, which did not match with my office hours, so i requested him to come earlier or in the evening, he didnt agree. I again contacted Kent customer care on Saturday (21 dec.) and requested them to schedule installation at the earliest, they scheduled installation at 3:30 PM same day, however, assigned the installation to the very same person who had been assigned earlier, and as usual he never came. I contacted kent customer care again on Sunday, however, of no use. It has become so difficult to get it installed, had i known it i would have never bought it

  Not filtering properly. Filtered water is containing white thread like particles. No support from customer care side. They are not replacing the faulty parts. Service center technician and owner and Kent Area sales manager all have seen the problem by home visit telling lie to the kent and denying to replace the part . They want me to do Lab test report for the water to get the part replaced.Very BAD SUPPORT from KENT. They don't want to replace the part becoz it is under warranty.NEVER BUY ANYTHING FROM KENT. THEY WILL NOT CHANGE THE PART BECAUSE IT IS UNDER WARRANTY. they will change the parts only when u give them money.

  I used this product from yesterday, so not to put any comments regarding the quality. Delivered on time by ATS, thanks for Amazon but I faced issues whenever I installed the product. After two days later technician came & tell me for purchasing Prefilter (Sediment Filter) which cost is  1650/ & also tell me if I not purchased the Pre-filter he back without installing the product. So I contact the Kent customer service & tell all the issues. After called the helpline I knew the actual price of Prefilter..700/. Nothing happens after lots of conference calld between Kent executive, local dealer & me. Me & my family members was frastete from the brand KENT. As per telephonic discussion with help line they arranged a senior manager call within two hours but write now I am not received any call from KENT HELP LINE CENTRE. Later I feel...this all  things out of my control so I paid 1650 & installed the product. My Local Dealer Name & contact details - GOUTAM PYNE, BANKURA, 8250950073, PIN- 722101, West Bengal.

It has all the same features as this one with that extra feature. As for the UV Lamp, it is not mentioned anywhere on Kent's Website or User Manual but by the looks of it, it does feel like a Stainless Steel Chamber (Do ask the Installation Guy or the Customer Service for the same). This was my Overall Experience for now and I opted than any other brand only because of that 3 years Extended AMC they are offering as opposed to their rivals. Thank You.

  The package was opened by KENT service person and he found that UF Membrane cartridge is broken and bypassed the connection.  Also he discouraged online purchase.  Instead of returning, he suggested to lodge a request via KENT Service App.  But it displays that my phone number is not updated.  At the same time it dispalys my  mobile number and address.  If the company do not replace the item, I have to return the unit for replacement

  Packaging was good.Water tastes good.Better than the previous version in terms of design.Installation was done in a timely manner.Storage indicator available but has no light.Required to buy the extra side filter and the cover for the Kent filter.Power consumption is less and purified water is 1 ltr for 2 ltr tap water.

  I recommend don't buy........1 - fake 1 year warranty and 3 year service free .After installation make abnormal sound and highly vibration in Kent RO inner parts ,After many times requested to customer Care no help and no response. Only say \"aapki Puri Shayta ki jayegi ,\"I requested to kent from Kent service app and also from customer Care number but after more then 15 days no service provided .2- price very very high ( same features) then other company and no quality and worst customer Care.3- Kent no free installation, if you call for installation then service person say you must buy prefilter from us and gives price 950 rupye extra. My prefilter buy from Amazon with KENR RO because prefilter recommendation by amazon, service person say you pay 300 rupye extra for your prefilter instaillation and no warranty provide KENT, if you Installation your prefilter ( I call customer care but no more help from Kent service center).4- don't go in brand name and high price because not always right,  brand name and high price.

  The installation request was raised on 16th Dec., however, no one has come to install it, that too even after calling customer care of kent 2-3 times. They assign the installation to one technician, who first told that he can come only between 10:30 AM to 1 PM, which did not match with my office hours, so i requested him to come earlier or in the evening, he didnt agree. I again contacted Kent customer care on Saturday (21 dec.) and requested them to schedule installation at the earliest, they scheduled installation at 3:30 PM same day, however, assigned the installation to the very same person who had been assigned earlier, and as usual he never came. I contacted kent customer care again on Sunday, however, of no use. It has become so difficult to get it installed, had i known it i would have never bought it

  Not filtering properly. Filtered water is containing white thread like particles. No support from customer care side. They are not replacing the faulty parts. Service center technician and owner and Kent Area sales manager all have seen the problem by home visit telling lie to the kent and denying to replace the part . They want me to do Lab test report for the water to get the part replaced.Very BAD SUPPORT from KENT. They don't want to replace the part becoz it is under warranty.NEVER BUY ANYTHING FROM KENT. THEY WILL NOT CHANGE THE PART BECAUSE IT IS UNDER WARRANTY. they will change the parts only when u give them money.

  I used this product from yesterday, so not to put any comments regarding the quality. Delivered on time by ATS, thanks for Amazon but I faced issues whenever I installed the product. After two days later technician came & tell me for purchasing Prefilter (Sediment Filter) which cost is  1650/ & also tell me if I not purchased the Pre-filter he back without installing the product. So I contact the Kent customer service & tell all the issues. After called the helpline I knew the actual price of Prefilter..700/. Nothing happens after lots of conference calld between Kent executive, local dealer & me. Me & my family members was frastete from the brand KENT. As per telephonic discussion with help line they arranged a senior manager call within two hours but write now I am not received any call from KENT HELP LINE CENTRE. Later I feel...this all  things out of my control so I paid 1650 & installed the product. My Local Dealer Name & contact details - GOUTAM PYNE, BANKURA, 8250950073, PIN- 722101, West Bengal.

  Would have given zero rating if it was possible, i have been a kent customer for years and over the years kents service and product has come down to a such low that its useless, feel cheated after buying this product, my advice do not go for kent products and check for alternatives,The installation is supposedly free, but the service engineer will always push for a pre-filter, this was usual and i have experienced this before so i was ok with it, but now these guys have come up with a new concept of pressure reducing valve and says this avoids the purifier from bursting in case of high pressure and also avoids air getting in, now both of these components seems reasonable and cannot be avoided then why is this not provided by default with the purifier as these are part of safety.All this is not even start, the machine i recieved had wrong internal connection of water flow (not sure wether it was wrong or the installation guy had poor knowledge) so he had to correct it, this shocked me as a purifier which is factory assembled and passed their quality and testing check should not ideally have wrong connection.After all this circus the purifier have started leaking water even after the purifier was powered down, and now i have shut the water line to the purifier so that i can avoid flooding of my apartment, and have come to a realization the poor water taste i was facing was because the water was never getting purified and it was just passing through as is.Now this is a clear case of defective product but kent does not have any return or replacement they can only service and i have to hope that they would fix it.

  I Purchased this Product on July 9, 2020, at around 7 pm and it was delivered on July 12, 2020, around 2 pm. I requested for the Installation as soon as receiving the Product and the Service Guy came within an Hour after calling me for the address info. The purifier was Installed on the same day even though 12th July being a Sunday. I would urge others to request for the Installation and not wait for the Brand to call back as it may take time as they offer service according to the Queue. Also, Speed of Installation or Service may take time as per the Service Provider Availability. In my case, the Installation Work was given to their Authorised Service Centre in my area. The Service Guy himself did everything on his own and the Overall Experience was Satisfactory. He asked me for the Prefilter on the call before coming and told me the price to be 700 ( which may vary with Service Provider) which I agreed. After the installation, he said he changed the Inline Sediment Filter as it was defective but being in warranty it won't cost me a buck. He also asked me for my preferred TDS Level and he suggested to set it at 80. One thing to note is that the TDS level can only be set by the Service Guy with the help of a screw and there's no knob or button available to the end-user. Another thing he told me is that the Warranty for the Sediment and Carbon Filters is 6 months and for other filters and Parts is 1 year, In that period, the Respective Parts will be changed free of cost by the Service Guy himself. After the One Year, Only Service will be Free (Visiting and Maintenance Charges) but the Filters or any other parts have to bear by the Consumer (500-1000 for filters and 2500 for water pump). He also suggested changing the Prefilter every 3 months which will cost around 100-200. For other filters, it may vary according to the Water Consumption and the Water Quality of the Source. Although filters should be changed at least once a year. One Important thing to note before buying this particular product which I completely missed is that Kent New Grand doesn't come with a UV lamp inside Storage Tank, whereas it is present in the Newer Model Kent New Grand Plus. I would highly recommend going for that Model as it is only 1000 rupees (at max) more than this one but the extra UV lamp does ensure there are no bacterias present in the Storage Tank itself after all the Purification has been done ( It comes with a 9L tank as compared to 8L).

  The installation request was raised on 16th Dec., however, no one has come to install it, that too even after calling customer care of kent 2-3 times. They assign the installation to one technician, who first told that he can come only between 10:30 AM to 1 PM, which did not match with my office hours, so i requested him to come earlier or in the evening, he didnt agree. I again contacted Kent customer care on Saturday (21 dec.) and requested them to schedule installation at the earliest, they scheduled installation at 3:30 PM same day, however, assigned the installation to the very same person who had been assigned earlier, and as usual he never came. I contacted kent customer care again on Sunday, however, of no use. It has become so difficult to get it installed, had i known it i would have never bought it

  Not filtering properly. Filtered water is containing white thread like particles. No support from customer care side. They are not replacing the faulty parts. Service center technician and owner and Kent Area sales manager all have seen the problem by home visit telling lie to the kent and denying to replace the part . They want me to do Lab test report for the water to get the part replaced.Very BAD SUPPORT from KENT. They don't want to replace the part becoz it is under warranty.NEVER BUY ANYTHING FROM KENT. THEY WILL NOT CHANGE THE PART BECAUSE IT IS UNDER WARRANTY. they will change the parts only when u give them money.

  I used this product from yesterday, so not to put any comments regarding the quality. Delivered on time by ATS, thanks for Amazon but I faced issues whenever I installed the product. After two days later technician came & tell me for purchasing Prefilter (Sediment Filter) which cost is  1650/ & also tell me if I not purchased the Pre-filter he back without installing the product. So I contact the Kent customer service & tell all the issues. After called the helpline I knew the actual price of Prefilter..700/. Nothing happens after lots of conference calld between Kent executive, local dealer & me. Me & my family members was frastete from the brand KENT. As per telephonic discussion with help line they arranged a senior manager call within two hours but write now I am not received any call from KENT HELP LINE CENTRE. Later I feel...this all  things out of my control so I paid 1650 & installed the product. My Local Dealer Name & contact details - GOUTAM PYNE, BANKURA, 8250950073, PIN- 722101, West Bengal.

  Would have given zero rating if it was possible, i have been a kent customer for years and over the years kents service and product has come down to a such low that its useless, feel cheated after buying this product, my advice do not go for kent products and check for alternatives,The installation is supposedly free, but the service engineer will always push for a pre-filter, this was usual and i have experienced this before so i was ok with it, but now these guys have come up with a new concept of pressure reducing valve and says this avoids the purifier from bursting in case of high pressure and also avoids air getting in, now both of these components seems reasonable and cannot be avoided then why is this not provided by default with the purifier as these are part of safety.All this is not even start, the machine i recieved had wrong internal connection of water flow (not sure wether it was wrong or the installation guy had poor knowledge) so he had to correct it, this shocked me as a purifier which is factory assembled and passed their quality and testing check should not ideally have wrong connection.After all this circus the purifier have started leaking water even after the purifier was powered down, and now i have shut the water line to the purifier so that i can avoid flooding of my apartment, and have come to a realization the poor water taste i was facing was because the water was never getting purified and it was just passing through as is.Now this is a clear case of defective product but kent does not have any return or replacement they can only service and i have to hope that they would fix it.

  I Purchased this Product on July 9, 2020, at around 7 pm and it was delivered on July 12, 2020, around 2 pm. I requested for the Installation as soon as receiving the Product and the Service Guy came within an Hour after calling me for the address info. The purifier was Installed on the same day even though 12th July being a Sunday. I would urge others to request for the Installation and not wait for the Brand to call back as it may take time as they offer service according to the Queue. Also, Speed of Installation or Service may take time as per the Service Provider Availability. In my case, the Installation Work was given to their Authorised Service Centre in my area. The Service Guy himself did everything on his own and the Overall Experience was Satisfactory. He asked me for the Prefilter on the call before coming and told me the price to be 700 ( which may vary with Service Provider) which I agreed. After the installation, he said he changed the Inline Sediment Filter as it was defective but being in warranty it won't cost me a buck. He also asked me for my preferred TDS Level and he suggested to set it at 80. One thing to note is that the TDS level can only be set by the Service Guy with the help of a screw and there's no knob or button available to the end-user. Another thing he told me is that the Warranty for the Sediment and Carbon Filters is 6 months and for other filters and Parts is 1 year, In that period, the Respective Parts will be changed free of cost by the Service Guy himself. After the One Year, Only Service will be Free (Visiting and Maintenance Charges) but the Filters or any other parts have to bear by the Consumer (500-1000 for filters and 2500 for water pump). He also suggested changing the Prefilter every 3 months which will cost around 100-200. For other filters, it may vary according to the Water Consumption and the Water Quality of the Source. Although filters should be changed at least once a year. One Important thing to note before buying this particular product which I completely missed is that Kent New Grand doesn't come with a UV lamp inside Storage Tank, whereas it is present in the Newer Model Kent New Grand Plus. I would highly recommend going for that Model as it is only 1000 rupees (at max) more than this one but the extra UV lamp does ensure there are no bacterias present in the Storage Tank itself after all the Purification has been done ( It comes with a 9L tank as compared to 8L). It has all the same features as this one with that extra feature. As for the UV Lamp, it is not mentioned anywhere on Kent's Website or User Manual but by the looks of it, it does feel like a Stainless Steel Chamber (Do ask the Installation Guy or the Customer Service for the same). This was my Overall Experience for now and I opted than any other brand only because of that 3 years Extended AMC they are offering as opposed to their rivals. Thank You.

  The package was opened by KENT service person and he found that UF Membrane cartridge is broken and bypassed the connection.  Also he discouraged online purchase.  Instead of returning, he suggested to lodge a request via KENT Service App.  But it displays that my phone number is not updated.  At the same time it dispalys my  mobile number and address.  If the company do not replace the item, I have to return the unit for replacement

  Packaging was good.Water tastes good.Better than the previous version in terms of design.Installation was done in a timely manner.Storage indicator available but has no light.Required to buy the extra side filter and the cover for the Kent filter.Power consumption is less and purified water is 1 ltr for 2 ltr tap water.

  I recommend don't buy........1 - fake 1 year warranty and 3 year service free .After installation make abnormal sound and highly vibration in Kent RO inner parts ,After many times requested to customer Care no help and no response. Only say \"aapki Puri Shayta ki jayegi ,\"I requested to kent from Kent service app and also from customer Care number but after more then 15 days no service provided .2- price very very high ( same features) then other company and no quality and worst customer Care.3- Kent no free installation, if you call for installation then service person say you must buy prefilter from us and gives price 950 rupye extra. My prefilter buy from Amazon with KENR RO because prefilter recommendation by amazon, service person say you pay 300 rupye extra for your prefilter instaillation and no warranty provide KENT, if you Installation your prefilter ( I call customer care but no more help from Kent service center).4- don't go in brand name and high price because not always right,  brand name and high price.
