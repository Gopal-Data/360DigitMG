"The theatrical is choppy, poorly edited, hard to follow, with some really good moments mixed in their. The extended is much more fluent and is much easier to follow, it does have a long runtime, which might make it seem a bit dragging on, but if you like long films done right, like Lord of the Rings, you will like this movie as long as you get into the characters and story. Speaking of which, the story starts out perfectly showing Bruce Wayne as a character, and it is very powerful. There are several moments in this movie that are powerful, emotional, and shocking. Characters. Batman is my favorite fictional character of all time, and believe me when I say, Ben Affleck as Batman was perfect, he had the charisma, the anger, and the look of being through some bad stuff Gal Gadot also does perfect as Wonder Woman, but if you want to really see how good she does, go watch the Wonder Woman movie. Henry Call as Superman. I really don't like it when people say Christopher Reeves is better. Don't get me wrong, Reeves does great, but can you imagine him as Superman in this movie? I wouldn't like it. It would be like Adam West playing Batman in The Dark Knight. Henry Cavill does great in this role, I can say everything about him as I said with Ben Affleck. Jesse Eisenberg as Luthor. I thought it was different in a good way. I've heard a criticism for him as being too much like Joker, but is that a bad thing? Joker is my favorite villain, so to see Superman have an enemy that crazy, but still hold the values Luthor needs to be Luthor, I think it is great. The thing I thought this movie was lacking in the first and second acts was humor, at least good humor. If there was more humor, I would've given this movie a ten because it would give a more relaxing feel to the parts that needed it. All in all though, this movie was awesome, it had powerful moments, it was badass, and just plain fun. It had a great story arc and does its job very well."

"*I will be talking about the Ultimate Edition of the film* This was one of the most anticipated CBM of all time. Ever since the arrival and subsequent success of Marvel's The Avengers people have wondered when will DC launch its own cinematic universe, one of the main reasons being the opportunity to finally see titans such as Batman and Superman share the screen together: the ultimate nerd dream. On 2016, the moment finally came for BvS to be released AND.. it performed poorly. Not only did critical reception left a lot to be desired, but fan reactions where surprisingly split after its cinematic debut. People either loved it and called Zack a genius, or hated it and called him a hack. Me, personally, I found myself with middle of the road feelings, for sure, but more leaning towards the negative side with subsequent viewings. The theatrical cut of the film showcased amazing performances, incredible visuals, and action set pieces that seemed like comic book panels come to life, in a good way. However, when it comes to its narrative structure and more technical aspects like editing, the film was seriously flawed. More plot holes than Age of Ultron, questionable character decisions, random editing that lacked cohesion and focus, and forced dramatic moments that lacked any impact because the attempts at character development ranged from limited to nonexistent, especially when it comes to Superman's character. I thought it was a 5/10 movie at best. As such, I was kind of skeptical about the idea of a 30 minute longer version. I say kind of because I know how Zack works. I remember Watchmen being vastly improved with its director's cut, so in a way I was expecting BvS to perform in a similar manner, but I also feared those 30 minutes wold be just there to amplify action and discredit storytelling issues. Oh boy, I'm so glad I was proved wrong. The ultimate cut of the film was infuriating, but not because it was awful, but because it questions the sanity of WB executives and editors and makes you wonder what were they thinking during the editing process. What I got out of the Ultimate Edition was a thought-provoking deconstruction of two very iconic superheroes that gave spotlight to the struggles both of them face when they aren't fighting crime. What I got was an extremely well produced character study on both Batman and Superman in a cynical world, a world dangerously close to our own. We meet Batman as a ruthless, worn out hero that has seen the failure behind his ideals and witnessed some truly horrifying things in his life. Superman, on the other hand, is portrayed as a godlike figure that seeks to do good in the world, but finds himself emotionally conflicted once he realized that every good deed he does leaves behind a trail of destruction (most of it due to Luthor's antics). In my opinion, this is a hugely original approach, one that distances itself from the rest of the competition and delivers a dark, somber, yet relevant superhero movie that understands both characters and gives them real human struggles to deal with. I felt invested in both of them, and hoped that by the end of the film both could find a way to redeem themselves. Their character arcs were very well established during the first two acts of the movie, and by the time we get to the titular climactic battle the emotion behind the jaw-dropping action is intensified. Lex Luthor as a villain was also given more time to develop with this new edition. One of the main criticisms with the original version was the fact that his plan relied too much on conveniences, and the character's mannerisms and mad-scientist attitude was annoying, and that goes without saying his motivations were unclear. Not only do we spend more time understanding his hate for any godlike figure and thus his hatred for Superman, but the added scenes allowed us to witness his entire plan come to fruition. It sells the cold, manipulative, calculating attributes of his comic counterpart. The acting is spot on. Every actor owns his/her role, from Cavill's Superman, to Ben Affleck as Batman, Eisenberg as Luthor, and Gadot as Wonder Woman, whose scenes are brief, but are more than enough to sell the strong and ferocious warrior that she is. Cinematography is stunning, and miles above that of Man of Steel's. And the soundtrack by Zimmer and Junkie XL? Perfect, just perfect. When it comes to flaws, the film still has some of those. The Martha moment, while serving as a pivotal character moment for Batman, felt off in execution, and its understandable that many people got mad at it. If your main complaint about BvS the first time around was its bleak tone and subject matter, this film is still not for you. I understand most were expecting to see the heroes being the most iconic versions of themselves, clashing in an elongated battle and evoking the same feelings The Avengers gave audiences back in 2012. In that sense, the film will remain divisive, but at least I have the comfort of saying that, at the very least, the film is competently made."

"This film was amazing. Ben Affleck was easily the best part of this movie, he brought his a-game as Batman. The chemistry between Affleck & Irons was outstanding. Gal Gadot did a great job as Wonder Woman. The fight between Batman & Superman was awesome. The final fight with Doomsday was outstanding in every way possible. However, there is only one problem with this film and that's Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor. He was sadly missed cast in this role, but then again it's really the fault of Warner Bros. Studios. Overall, this film deliver on almost every level. I highly recommend that you watch the extended version of this film."

"I know I know. I saw it in theaters too, and felt like it could've been so much better. While the Batman element was good, the narrative felt fractured, and the third act was just one long stunt scene. Superman was relegated to a supporting character, and other characters didn't get a chance to shine. And then I chanced on the ultimate cut. Calling it 30 mins of \"extra\" footage is unfair to Zack Snyder because it's exactly these 30 mins that makes the movie a worthy one. What I can say about the theatrical cut is this - It had the blockbuster elements - music, visuals, stunts, CGI. But, it lacked the human elements. The first 20 mins of the movie had it, but not after that. The extended cut in comparison has a flow to the narrative. There are no disjointed scenes, everything flows smoothly, and there's connective tissue. Superman gets to spend some time with his father, and mother. Clark Kent does some investigative journalism. Superman helps the people after the blast. Lois Lane doesn't jump to conclusions, she gets to the bottom of the crime. Lex Luthor apparently had a coherent plan - everything is explained pretty well. Wonder Woman was already good, so there's no change there :) Also, the \"Martha\" scene seems better executed, because it is a few seconds longer, and there's time to breathe it in. So, here's my take on this movie - The theatrical cut was junk. Get the Bluray for ultimate edition, and you shall not be disappointed. I've seen it so many more times now, and it's the definitive cut. It is the movie we deserve. It's a unique take on Batman, and Superman. It's a gritty take on the superhero movie genre, and definitely the best DCEU movie, and the best DC movie since The Dark Knight.P.S. Yes it's dark. We're adults, and we should appreciate mature film making without intentionally silly moments. It attempts to be philosophical, and something deep instead of just trying to make you chuckle."

"This is one of the best superhero movies ever made. Zack Snyder is a magician behind the camera.The reason behind so many complaints is the fact that Warner Bros. marketed this movie as a fight between Batman and Superman. That's not what it is. It's a movie about the origins of the Justice League.The cinematography, the acting and the score are all second to none. This film is phenomenal.P.S: watch the 3 hour extended cut that Snyder intended you to see, not the 2 and a half hour movie that Warner Bros. decided would be better for theaters."

"I don't care what the critics say, this is a very well-done movie. I'll start my review by listing what I like about the movie.1.) Ben Affleck is the best batman to me and it is not close. He pulls off the role of an aging batman extremely well. Also, Zack Snyder's vision of batman is legit. I have always hated batman up until this adaptation of him. Instead of being a conflicted and idealistic batman, this batman is dark, gritty, and 100% a badass. His equipment is decked out with machine guns and he has no aversion to killing people. In fact, he probably kills about 50 criminal by the time this movie is over. The warehouse scene is the coolest batman scene in any movie.2.) The development of a grudge between batman and superman is pulled off flawlessly. It actually makes sense why batman dislikes superman. Then, when they do fight it is about the coolest thing you can expect to see from a superhero film. 3.) I disagree with a lot of people about Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor. In my opinion, he played his role to perfection. 4.) B v S sets up Wonder Woman and Justice League with Gal Gadot's cameo as Wonder Woman and short clips of Aquaman, the Flash, and Cyborg. B v S is one of my favorite superhero films and rewatching it never gets old."

"The theatrical cut of this film is garbage which is why I rated it eight stars instead of nine. The first time I watched this film I didn't like it (not straight out hate but didn't like). Character motivations didn't make any sense, Lex was annoying as s***, editing was sloppy, and it was overly dark and broody for an action superhero movie. A year + a half, five Marvel films, a ton of bad reviews and a Justice League later a thought popped into my head: \"what if I watched BVS again\". This time I didn't have trailers ruining the best moments, I only vaguely remembered the film, and I was conditioned to look at it negatively but something unexpected happened: I actually loved it. Superman was just a normal person that tried to make a difference cause he could that others imposed their own beliefs on. Lex Luthor was a genius that couldn't stand his powerlessness compared to Superman or more accurately a super being. As Alfred said \"The fever, the rage, the feeling of powerlessness that turns good men... cruel\" and you see the same thought process in Batman. Batman, just like Lex Luthor feels powerless in the midst of a god-being and just like Lex he attempts to destroy him so he can get his sense of power back but unlike Lex, Batman learns something. I what is one of the corniest lines of the movie Superman says, \"Martha\" when he knows he can't win against Batman in a late desperate attempt to save his mother. Not only does this name connect with Bruce Wayne but it also shows what really matters to a man of steel: it isn't power, it isn't fame or anything else, it is his Mother and on a broader scale it is people. Lex (who doesn't care about people at all) knows he doesn't have the power so he creates something from his blood and the remains of Zod: A Doomsday for Superman. Not only does this film have depth but it also doesn't always explain it to you which is rare in a blockbuster action superhero flick normally cater to semi-comic book fans and people that want to shove popcorn in their mouths. This film rewards you for really noticing the details while still having massive explosions. One of my favorites is how Lex has all of Batman's branded killed which is why he isn't afraid of the branding at the end or Grandma's Peach Tea as a way of scaring the s*** out of someone. Of course, this film isn't perfect and I do have personal dislikes. The Batman V Superman fight was slow and pretty boring especially after watching such an amazing fight in Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 2 (If you haven't watched the animated Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 1 and 2 you are sorely missing out on something fantastic). Also, the addition of Wonder Woman who pretty much steals a hacker thing, gives it back and then suits up and fights against a giant monster thing. Not to say I don't like Wonder Woman (She is one of my favorite Superheroes of all time who showed not only can woman kick a** but they also don't need to be ashamed of their sexuality or gender) but she wasn't really that helpful to the plot and just brought in to expand the universe which was well done through Lex's superhuman hunting files. Also, the post-apocalyptic scene that was just a dream could have been cut but nothing is perfect except movies like Citizen Kane which isn't a lot of fun to watch cause it is too perfect. So to summarize, the theatrical cut is bad, the ultimate cut is Amazing and the other cut is meh. Please give it a second chance because it deserves it and save a good director from losing grace because of something he didn't do."
"I really liked it, don't know what all the hate is about. I'm actually a Marvel fan from when I was 7 or so, but Superman and Batman together in 1 movie? Just great. And personally I like Ben Affleck even better than Christian Bale as Batman. So just watch and enjoy, I know I did!"

"That's right. We have been waiting for these two heroes to finally meet and fight against each other. This movie is so good in both plot and special effects.Henry Cavill and Ben Affleck have performed well in their acting stages. They are the best superhero actors and they have filmed their fighting scenes very well. The movie starts to show the conflict between the lives of the heroes and now they have blamed each other for it. This movie is amazing and sets up a good plot for Dawn Justice."

"Actually...I didn't know what to expect. When you see Wonder Woman, you know it will be off of Wonder Woman and off of a Wonder Woman story, but with Batman V Superman, I was like, \"hmmmm, so who is this about?\" It was pretty obvious that it would feature many characters, but I thought the introduction to Batman was amazing. Ben Affleck nailed the part, not only as Batman but also as Bruce Wayne. He is my Batman. Henry Cavill continued to be super as the Man of Steel. And he is my Super - Man. A dark story? Yes, without a doubt. Could it have had a few more jokes? Sure. But not all movies or stories need to have jokes when certain events are serious. I really hope people can see this review and take another look at the movie, because, I loved it. I really hope the ratings can go up, eventually. And P.S, this movie is the perfect set up to Justice League."

"I'll start by making it clear I have only ever seen the Ultimate Edition. I'm aware of what was cut out for the theatrical release, so I will concede up front that most of the criticisms about pacing, editing, and missing bits of plot at release were merited.With that caveat out of the way, I must reiterate that this was bar-none the boldest superhero movie I have ever seen. To me, it was arguably the best as well, though \"best\" shouldn't be taken to mean \"most enjoyable.\" That honor easily goes to \"Thor: Ragnarok.\" What makes BvS stand out among other films in the genre is that it takes two characters who have been done to death since the 1970s and brings them up to date. I recently tried to watch \"Superman: The Movie\" for the first time in a number of years, and while it was still good and Reeves will always be iconic, I just couldn't take it seriously. I'll put it this way: If the story in BvS was \"stupid\" in your view but Superman turning back time by spinning the earth backward on its axis didn't seem like one of the dumbest things you have ever seen -in any movie from any genre- to the extent that it outright ruins the movie for you, then your opinion about BvS isn't worth much. Nostalgic bias was always going to be a problem for this movie, and the way people reacted to and reviewed \"Man of Steel\" was telling in this regard.That brings me to Zack Snyder's take on Superman. You know, that guy whose status as the first extraterrestrial ever encountered by humanity was a total non-issue in the old movies. Apparently, Snyder has a similar view to my own in that his take on the Man of Steel makes his being an alien a core piece of his identity. He may look like any other (absurdly attractive) person, but he knows what he is, and that makes him perpetually uncertain of where he fits in this world. He is essentially good and really does care about people, but he struggles to truly empathize with the likes of us. To be human is to be frail, and that is not something he can easily relate to. This is the root of his conflict with Batman.Just as Clark struggles to genuinely relate to most people, Snyder's Batman either refuses to or otherwise just can't relate to Superman. He doesn't see him as anything but a threat regardless of Superman's clear good intentions. Remember, a small group of Kryptonians were able to bring humanity to the brink of extinction in less than a day, and Bruce Wayne is nothing if not a realist. He didn't know the guy from Kansas. He only knew the god from another world.While Batman's anger toward and fear of Superman are readily apparent from the start, Superman's inability to imagine things from Bruce Wayne's perspective only becomes truly apparent during their first real interaction. This reminded me of the animated version of the \"world's finest\" storyline, where Superman judges Batman harshly for using fear tactics and threats of violence (also, actual violence) to get the job done. Superman wasn't willing to consider what it would take for a human man to fight criminals and save innocents, or what that life would do to him over time. Just as Batman didn't see the guy from Kansas, Superman didn't see the man who lives his life trapped in one brutal, unthinkably traumatic moment (this was beautifully conveyed during the film's opening moments), and had spent his whole adult life bearing witness to humanity at its absolute worst.The conflict between these two characters is as old as human history. They want the same things, but they can't understand one another. So they fight. And what a fight it was.Watching a fight between, say, Captain America and Iron Man was, to me, more frustrating than anything because each understood the other's perspective perfectly. The fight between Batman and Superman in BvS was genuinely gut-wrenching, as intended, because they would have understood one another if either had tried. The whole sequence hilighted Batman's tactical prowess and ability to control a situation. Maybe the most badass thing about the fight was that it ended exactly where Batman planned. That brings me to the big elephant in the room named \"Martha.\"I can't recall exactly which YouTuber put it this way, but if you thought the \"save Martha\" exchange was about their mothers having the same name, you had your brain turned off. The brain-on people have explained this to death, but it bears repeating. This was the moment when Superman became humanized to Batman. He was about to die, and his only concern was for his adoptive human mother. He still believed that the man about to take his life would do the right thing. Even with the cowl on, there was no mistaking the look on Batman's face. It was the look of shame, guilt, and sudden uncertainty that says \"What am I doing?\" Turns out even the most brutal, angry version of Bruce Wayne is better than Tony Stark at knowing right from wrong. At knowing that he had gone too far.From there, the third act was a series of truly impressive (albeit mostly CGI) fight sequences, beginning with what I regard as the undisputed champion of Batman fights. Nothing in the Nolan movies (and especially nothing in the Burton movies) even came close. Go ahead, try to convince yourself that Batman and Bane taking turns punching one another in the face until Bane's mask broke was a good fight sequence. No, this was a fight straight out of \"Arkham Knight,\" and it was glorious. The battle against Doomsday really was one for the books. From the moment Wonder Woman arrived accompanied by the intense sounds of Tina Guo's electric cello to Superman's tragic, heroic death at the hands of Doomsday, I was glued to the screen. Sure, the mere presence of Doomsday spoiled the end to a degree, but watching the Man of Steel laboring to carry that kryptonite spear towards certain death was no less impactful. A brief word on Jesse Eisenberg's take on Lex Luthor. At least one other reviewer on this site already said it best when they pointed out that this was his origin story. If you consider his scheme objectively, he is actually one of the more formidable incarnations of the character. If we're lucky, we'll eventually get to see a Snyder Cut of \"Justice League\" and find out where this story was actually meant to go. For the record, Joss Whedon and Danny Elfman both should have said \"no\" to taking a dump on someone else's art."
"BATMAN V SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE brings a fantastic surprise to a smash-hit team-up with one of the worlds most beloved DC Comics' icons of all time. The movie delivers spectacular casting, and fantastic acting with different characters having their shine in each scenes.The story follows Clark Kent/Superman who becomes a threat, after the destruction in Metropolis in Man Of Steel.(2013). Batman/Bruce Wayne sees him as a threat and begins his war on Superman.The movie brings spectacular storytelling, it tells the complications of human against alien who are on the same side, and the first meeting of Batman and Superman. The story of Bruce Wayne, with his many years of The Caped Crusader, sends him on a spiral of \"out of control\", sheer anger, and builds tension to wanting to defeat the Man of Steel. Snyder has fantastically gave this storytelling an exciting nod to the comics.Lex Luthor, played by Jesse Einsberg, delivers a very interesting performance, but very differently by him showing is his \"origin\" before he becomes a bald foe to the Man of Steel. He shows that his love of \"god vs man\" terrorises mankind when he ultimately creates Doomsday, and Batman realises Superman's inner heroism.It packs so many great \"out of nowhere\" excitement, including a first-look of the fearful Wonder Woman a.k.a. Diana Prince, played by Gal Gadot, and a fresh-new glimpse of the superhero DC canon: The Justice League.WATCH THIS MOVIE! The critics are out of their mind. It's a fun-packed action adventure which still keeps the movie enjoyable until it's final minutes of the movie. It's a FANTASTIC MOVIE! BEN AFFLECK AS BATMAN... is Incredible!A 10/10 overall!"
"I want to go on record as saying that this is a truly thrilling cinematic experience in so many ways. If pressed, I guess I could acknowledge that there were a couple ... let's say \"clumsy\" moments. And in a film that runs to three hours, that hardly seems like a significant issue, certainly not enough to rate it with fewer than 9 stars.This film has everything. There is dramatic tension right from the start. There is a magnificent story arc that picks up quite seamlessly from 'Man of Steel' and propels the viewer not only into the life of Clark Kent/Superman but also of Bruce Wayne/Batman.The villain is no mere cartoon of a villain; he is truly thoroughly (and apparently irrevocably) diabolical. He is a psychopath, and you wish for his death over and over and over. You want Superman to reduce him to ash with the power of his eyes.I have read a number of viewers' reviews, and it seems that the people who disliked the film / gave it a low rating had rather unfair and unrealistic expectations of it. That is, their own prejudices about how the plot could/should unfold or what the character development could/should be, etc. ruined the film for them. And that is a shame.My thought is: I settle into my seat, wait for the lights to dim, and then I wait to be transported by the film. I accept it, lock, stock, and barrel.As another reviewer remarked, I love how the film begins from the point of view of Bruce Wayne as he is among people on the ground who have fallen victim to the attack of Zod and the other Kryptonians.Why would Bruce Wayne not like Superman? Why would the good people of Earth hurl insults at Superman and burn him in effigy (on the news)? Because the good people of Earth just got catapulted into a new reality in which there are not only extraterrestrial beings (surprise!) but they are also superman! And a group of them are hell-bent on destroying humankind and taking the planet for themselves.It is difficult to see Superman as separate from the whole Kryptonian Krew.It seems that many moviegoers forgot that Bruce Wayne is also human. Sure, he's a hero, but he is flawed.. Just like the rest of us. He is a vigilante, after all.He has let his vigilantism get the better of him. HE is actually the one working outside the boundaries of the law, not Superman. It is the clear head of Alfred that shows us that he has gone into a rather dark place, that he has not seen what is really going on (in Luthor's scheme), and so he chooses to embark on his own scheme scheme to take out the alien invader. He is (allegedly) thinking of the future: if he wipes out the all-powerful alien, then it can't turn on humankind in the future. At least, he convinces himself of that.A philosophical question is raised in the film: should Clark Kent have remained a simple man from Kansas and never have become the Superman? Should he just let people die and let calamities happen? The question is answered for us in the character of Diana Prince/Wonder Woman. She withdrew from mankind (her exact words) and just sat around watching. Watching while people died horrible deaths all around her. So, should Superman have done the same? Do these special beings, these 'metahumans', have some kind of moral imperative to intervene, or should they be allowed to be regular people, too? It seems that humans want it both ways.It seems that humans are saying: \"Don't be a superalien ... except when I and my friends and family are in trouble. Then come save us.\""

"Batman v Superman: Ultimate Edition: If your looking for a quick, cheap thrill then you might not enjoy this film at the time. This movies theatrical version was butchered by WB and in doing so reshaped the story leaving numerous plot holes. So the Ultimate Edition is the full story and the one worth seeing. Watch 'Man of Steel' before seeing this movie. There is much to claw through here, so much so that the audience might easily find themselves exhausted from the overall aggression of the film. However, a lot of the story does work. The action is good, and the emotion feels real most of the time.This film is about Superman trying to become Superman. Trying to help the world, save people, find a place in this world not as an outcast, and yet is looked at has a threat by many. Superman is not from this world, yet He is trying to be human, find a place in this world, be excepted by earths people, and come into his destiny.This film is also about Batman being Batman for 20 years and losing faith in humanity, and fearing Superman, what Superman can do with his powers. Great film, great plot, great visuals. ---Yidioo"
"I didn't see the film in the theaters and just bought the \"Extended Edition \" on Amazon. I never properly saw Man of Steel- i think I rented it and watched it when already exhausted and fell asleep. I saw the mediocre user reviews and horrible reviews from critics of this film.They really have it wrong. This is the very best either Batman or Superman. It has a different take, on things. Much darker then earlier films even darker then the Christopher Nolan Batman films.First of all Christopher Nolan is an Executive Producer. So how bad could it be? I loved Sucker Punch and Zack Snyder was involved with that. So how bad could this be? Hans Zimmer did the music, so how bad could it be?I remember watching the old Superman TV shows and reading the Superman and Batman comics as a little kid and loved them, but i wouldn't call myself a \"fan boy\" of comic universes, like so many younger people today. As an older adult I will admit my favorite TV show of all time was Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but watched it on DVD only after it had finished. I saw the second of the Dark Knight series in the theater, but the other two, I watched on DVD. They were great, but not my favorite films like so many people. i also loved the first couple Superman and Batman films in the older series. Regardless, i was not waiting with baited breath to see Man of Steel or this one.I'm more of a serious film fan, who can watch Stanley Kubrick films over and over and my favorite films in the last twenty years, are Eyes Wide Shut and Intersteller, both of which i've watched multiple times.So, with that said, take it from me, the critics have this film very wrong, just as critics hated 2001: A Space Odyssey when it first came out. This film will have lasting appreciation.Surprised how much I liked Ben Afleck's Batman. it was hard to get into Henry Cavil's scrawnier looking Superman, but it grew on me. Amy Adams was great as Lois Lane, The Gal Gadol Wonder Women was amazing. Lex Luther was terrific, like Nolan's Joker. Jeremy Irons was the best Alfred ever. Holly Hunter and Diane Lane was good too. The movie had bad reviews but made a billion dollars. Hopefully everyone buys the Ultimate Edition and it breaks sales records and the film is re-appreciated. I have no idea what scenes this Ultimate Edition added, but it is pretty perfect. Now I can't wait for Wonder Woman and the Justice League and as soon as I finish writing this am going to watch Man of Steal. I'm into it now!I can only surmise that the bad reviews stem from too much expectations of the rigid fan boy types and the radical changes in tone, we see in this film.Total masterpiece of cinema, but I have a few criticisms. There are a few hollow scenes of typical Idiot cops and authorities getting everything wrong in a cliché type way and it has a few filler scenes of that type and a few moments here and there that felt rushed and cheesy. Maybe not everything restored into the Ultimate Edition should have been. I wish there had been more Kevin Costner scenes."

"The whole entire Batman V Superman movie was great and yes even though it felt slow to the majority of the people who watched it but to me I enjoyed every part and every scene of Batman V Superman and when it got to the fight scenes both batman VS Superman and the Doomsday fight it brought so much drama, intensity, and epic performances. So with that being said I give this movie a good 10/10 because it really did go to my expectations and it brought a powerful performance and a powerful yet epic introduction to the upcoming Justice League."

"Zack Snyder not only understands the characters but he also understands how to craft a real amazing movie for fans - honestly blew me away (extended cut) Brilliant!Don't believe what the internet is telling you to think - take this from a person who has worked in the comic book industry - this is amazing!"

"When I first wrote a review for this movie a year ago exclaiming my excitement for the film, I had been high off a fresh dose of live-action DC superheroes playing out the beloved comic book stories that I had grown up on. It was all playing out before my eyes and coming to life. After a few months had passed, I began to notice things about the movie that I disliked: little gaps in the story, things that didn't add up, etc. My original rating of a 10 / 10 dropped to an 8 /10. But today it has gone back up to a 10. The extended version of the film not only rectifies the gaps but also silences critics.Many claimed that the movie was too dark or that it just didn't make sense. To those people, I say: \"Pick up a comic book!\" Many of the critics of this particular film were part of the superhero bandwagon that formed when Marvel began its spree of Avengers-related films. In fact, its estimated that over 60% of people who go to see 'superhero' genre films have never picked up a comic book in their life. I would argue that similar numbers could figure to those which view the CW televised DC Universe shows. People complain that DC comics is just too dark but the fact is that these movies are based upon actual comics which are meant to be dark (ex: The Dark Knight Returns, Injustice, etc.). Its like complaining that Game of Thrones (the TV series) sucks because they kill off too many characters. Read the books! Its frustrating to see such a beautiful work of art like Batman V Superman criticized by those ignorant to its universe and its meaning. This movie is in fact a catalyst that opens numerous doorways and leaves true fans in awe of the possibilities for future movies. But regardless of whether or not people choose to educate themselves, this film's DVD/Blu-ray extended version puts the theater release to shame. All of the plot holes and gaps are filled in 30 minutes of extended footage scattered throughout the film. The movie ultimately becomes more complete and people will wish that the movie had shown the full 3 hours of footage in its theatrical debut. As a major DC comics fan, I will of course pick up on things that a comics fan would not, but someone who does not read comics would learn to appreciate this film in its entirety with the extended version. Get your hands on a copy today or find it on Netflix or the internet somewhere!"

"I ignored the bad reviews and watched anyways. This film had a lot to live up to after Civil War was released and I went into this film expecting the worst. It ended up to be the best Superhero film of 2016 to me. One complaint was that this film was more concerned about universe building than telling a great story than Civil War but for me it was the other way around; Civil War felt like a build up to something else and to be honest, I felt that way when I saw the other MCU films. Batman vs Superman however not only had a great story, but it also felt a lot more consistent than Civil War. This film was way more diverse with the cast than the MCU but unlike the MCU, I felt like this film doesn't go overboard with the SJW stuff like the MCU films or The Star Wars Sequel films do. The Visuals were AMAZING, The Score by Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL was AMAZING as well, The Tone is just right as I actually felt for the characters emotionally, The Cinematography kept my eyes glued to the screen, and the script felt really Intelligent and Complex and despite people calling the writing confusing, I was able to piece it together with no problem whatsoever. This film is similar to Empire Strikes back in terms of popularity so over time after the other movies are released, this movie would probably be more popular.This film was way better than I Expected and deserves another chance.

"Its shame to see what critics and marvel fans did to this movie and targeted Zack Snyder for it. I have seen this movie more than 25 times till date. And i enjoy this movie as much as i enjoyed the first time. The fans who have read DC comics, wouldn't be disappointed in this movie. Its dark movie, yes it is. Because the title shows the intense situation at hand. Two superheroes about to rip each other apart for whatever reasons that brought them to this stage. Yes it had to be dark and intense.Only marvel can be stupid enough to show an alien invasion where humans are loosing the battle and the super heroes are cracking jokes while battles as if they are playing ping pong. a person playing Call of Duty game is more serious while playing than the marvel heroes fighting aliens."

"Last week some news came out from somebody online who had claimed to have seen a finished version of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. If you were like me, you've been leery of checking it out because you weren't sure how much might actually be true. Now Zack Snyder has spoken out about the spoiler-filled post, although his response doesn't really clear anything up.In a word, to MTV, he called the post \"hilarious,which might imply that he's saying that it's mostly, if not entirely, untrue. That might be the case, but then again he could have just said it was untrue and he didn't say that. What he did say, however, is that he doesn't like spoilers. While this may seem odd for the director who's most recent trailer appeared to give away the entire movie, Snyder says that's not the case. Even if you've seen the trailer, you can rest easy, as there is much more we have not seen in then finished film. Says Snyder I have the benefit of seeing the movie. It's cool that think it's too much, and I appreciate people not wanting to know, but there's plenty that they don't know. There's a lot of movie that's not in the trailer. In the process of calling the Batman v Superman Reddit review hilarious, Snyder goes on to talk about how he hates it when spoilers come out. The director would much rather that fans see the movie mostly blind. While he understands that some fans may wish to find the answers before hand, he wants his movies to be mysteries going in. If you're, as an audience member, exploring these articles, looking for answers to questions that you have, maybe you're okay with knowing before you go. It's like an individual taste. But like I said, I want people to see the movie without knowing.Spoilers are a topic that mean different things to different people. While most try to avoid them to some degree, the need to solve the mystery is a nearly universal human experience. We have an inclination to want to know the truth, even while also wanting to be surprised. For most of us getting some information is good, but getting all the information is bad, of course, only getting the details that you want can be difficult."
"The theatrical is choppy, poorly edited, hard to follow, with some really good moments mixed in their. The extended is much more fluent and is much easier to follow, it does have a long runtime, which might make it seem a bit dragging on, but if you like long films done right, like Lord of the Rings, you will like this movie as long as you get into the characters and story. Speaking of which, the story starts out perfectly showing Bruce Wayne as a character, and it is very powerful. There are several moments in this movie that are powerful, emotional, and shocking. Characters. Batman is my favorite fictional character of all time, and believe me when I say, Ben Affleck as Batman was perfect, he had the charisma, the anger, and the look of being through some bad stuff Gal Gadot also does perfect as Wonder Woman, but if you want to really see how good she does, go watch the Wonder Woman movie. Henry Call as Superman. I really don't like it when people say Christopher Reeves is better. Don't get me wrong, Reeves does great, but can you imagine him as Superman in this movie? I wouldn't like it. It would be like Adam West playing Batman in The Dark Knight. Henry Cavill does great in this role, I can say everything about him as I said with Ben Affleck. Jesse Eisenberg as Luthor. I thought it was different in a good way. I've heard a criticism for him as being too much like Joker, but is that a bad thing? Joker is my favorite villain, so to see Superman have an enemy that crazy, but still hold the values Luthor needs to be Luthor, I think it is great. The thing I thought this movie was lacking in the first and second acts was humor, at least good humor. If there was more humor, I would've given this movie a ten because it would give a more relaxing feel to the parts that needed it. All in all though, this movie was awesome, it had powerful moments, it was badass, and just plain fun. It had a great story arc and does its job very well."

"*I will be talking about the Ultimate Edition of the film* This was one of the most anticipated CBM of all time. Ever since the arrival and subsequent success of Marvel's The Avengers people have wondered when will DC launch its own cinematic universe, one of the main reasons being the opportunity to finally see titans such as Batman and Superman share the screen together: the ultimate nerd dream. On 2016, the moment finally came for BvS to be released AND.. it performed poorly. Not only did critical reception left a lot to be desired, but fan reactions where surprisingly split after its cinematic debut. People either loved it and called Zack a genius, or hated it and called him a hack. Me, personally, I found myself with middle of the road feelings, for sure, but more leaning towards the negative side with subsequent viewings. The theatrical cut of the film showcased amazing performances, incredible visuals, and action set pieces that seemed like comic book panels come to life, in a good way. However, when it comes to its narrative structure and more technical aspects like editing, the film was seriously flawed. More plot holes than Age of Ultron, questionable character decisions, random editing that lacked cohesion and focus, and forced dramatic moments that lacked any impact because the attempts at character development ranged from limited to nonexistent, especially when it comes to Superman's character. I thought it was a 5/10 movie at best. As such, I was kind of skeptical about the idea of a 30 minute longer version. I say kind of because I know how Zack works. I remember Watchmen being vastly improved with its director's cut, so in a way I was expecting BvS to perform in a similar manner, but I also feared those 30 minutes wold be just there to amplify action and discredit storytelling issues. Oh boy, I'm so glad I was proved wrong. The ultimate cut of the film was infuriating, but not because it was awful, but because it questions the sanity of WB executives and editors and makes you wonder what were they thinking during the editing process. What I got out of the Ultimate Edition was a thought-provoking deconstruction of two very iconic superheroes that gave spotlight to the struggles both of them face when they aren't fighting crime. What I got was an extremely well produced character study on both Batman and Superman in a cynical world, a world dangerously close to our own. We meet Batman as a ruthless, worn out hero that has seen the failure behind his ideals and witnessed some truly horrifying things in his life. Superman, on the other hand, is portrayed as a godlike figure that seeks to do good in the world, but finds himself emotionally conflicted once he realized that every good deed he does leaves behind a trail of destruction (most of it due to Luthor's antics). In my opinion, this is a hugely original approach, one that distances itself from the rest of the competition and delivers a dark, somber, yet relevant superhero movie that understands both characters and gives them real human struggles to deal with. I felt invested in both of them, and hoped that by the end of the film both could find a way to redeem themselves. Their character arcs were very well established during the first two acts of the movie, and by the time we get to the titular climactic battle the emotion behind the jaw-dropping action is intensified. Lex Luthor as a villain was also given more time to develop with this new edition. One of the main criticisms with the original version was the fact that his plan relied too much on conveniences, and the character's mannerisms and mad-scientist attitude was annoying, and that goes without saying his motivations were unclear. Not only do we spend more time understanding his hate for any godlike figure and thus his hatred for Superman, but the added scenes allowed us to witness his entire plan come to fruition. It sells the cold, manipulative, calculating attributes of his comic counterpart. The acting is spot on. Every actor owns his/her role, from Cavill's Superman, to Ben Affleck as Batman, Eisenberg as Luthor, and Gadot as Wonder Woman, whose scenes are brief, but are more than enough to sell the strong and ferocious warrior that she is. Cinematography is stunning, and miles above that of Man of Steel's. And the soundtrack by Zimmer and Junkie XL? Perfect, just perfect. When it comes to flaws, the film still has some of those. The Martha moment, while serving as a pivotal character moment for Batman, felt off in execution, and its understandable that many people got mad at it. If your main complaint about BvS the first time around was its bleak tone and subject matter, this film is still not for you. I understand most were expecting to see the heroes being the most iconic versions of themselves, clashing in an elongated battle and evoking the same feelings The Avengers gave audiences back in 2012. In that sense, the film will remain divisive, but at least I have the comfort of saying that, at the very least, the film is competently made."

"This film was amazing. Ben Affleck was easily the best part of this movie, he brought his a-game as Batman. The chemistry between Affleck & Irons was outstanding. Gal Gadot did a great job as Wonder Woman. The fight between Batman & Superman was awesome. The final fight with Doomsday was outstanding in every way possible. However, there is only one problem with this film and that's Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor. He was sadly missed cast in this role, but then again it's really the fault of Warner Bros. Studios. Overall, this film deliver on almost every level. I highly recommend that you watch the extended version of this film."

"I know I know. I saw it in theaters too, and felt like it could've been so much better. While the Batman element was good, the narrative felt fractured, and the third act was just one long stunt scene. Superman was relegated to a supporting character, and other characters didn't get a chance to shine. And then I chanced on the ultimate cut. Calling it 30 mins of \"extra\" footage is unfair to Zack Snyder because it's exactly these 30 mins that makes the movie a worthy one. What I can say about the theatrical cut is this - It had the blockbuster elements - music, visuals, stunts, CGI. But, it lacked the human elements. The first 20 mins of the movie had it, but not after that. The extended cut in comparison has a flow to the narrative. There are no disjointed scenes, everything flows smoothly, and there's connective tissue. Superman gets to spend some time with his father, and mother. Clark Kent does some investigative journalism. Superman helps the people after the blast. Lois Lane doesn't jump to conclusions, she gets to the bottom of the crime. Lex Luthor apparently had a coherent plan - everything is explained pretty well. Wonder Woman was already good, so there's no change there :) Also, the \"Martha\" scene seems better executed, because it is a few seconds longer, and there's time to breathe it in. So, here's my take on this movie - The theatrical cut was junk. Get the Bluray for ultimate edition, and you shall not be disappointed. I've seen it so many more times now, and it's the definitive cut. It is the movie we deserve. It's a unique take on Batman, and Superman. It's a gritty take on the superhero movie genre, and definitely the best DCEU movie, and the best DC movie since The Dark Knight.P.S. Yes it's dark. We're adults, and we should appreciate mature film making without intentionally silly moments. It attempts to be philosophical, and something deep instead of just trying to make you chuckle."

"This is one of the best superhero movies ever made. Zack Snyder is a magician behind the camera.The reason behind so many complaints is the fact that Warner Bros. marketed this movie as a fight between Batman and Superman. That's not what it is. It's a movie about the origins of the Justice League.The cinematography, the acting and the score are all second to none. This film is phenomenal.P.S: watch the 3 hour extended cut that Snyder intended you to see, not the 2 and a half hour movie that Warner Bros. decided would be better for theaters."

"I don't care what the critics say, this is a very well-done movie. I'll start my review by listing what I like about the movie.1.) Ben Affleck is the best batman to me and it is not close. He pulls off the role of an aging batman extremely well. Also, Zack Snyder's vision of batman is legit. I have always hated batman up until this adaptation of him. Instead of being a conflicted and idealistic batman, this batman is dark, gritty, and 100% a badass. His equipment is decked out with machine guns and he has no aversion to killing people. In fact, he probably kills about 50 criminal by the time this movie is over. The warehouse scene is the coolest batman scene in any movie.2.) The development of a grudge between batman and superman is pulled off flawlessly. It actually makes sense why batman dislikes superman. Then, when they do fight it is about the coolest thing you can expect to see from a superhero film. 3.) I disagree with a lot of people about Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor. In my opinion, he played his role to perfection. 4.) B v S sets up Wonder Woman and Justice League with Gal Gadot's cameo as Wonder Woman and short clips of Aquaman, the Flash, and Cyborg. B v S is one of my favorite superhero films and rewatching it never gets old."

"The theatrical cut of this film is garbage which is why I rated it eight stars instead of nine. The first time I watched this film I didn't like it (not straight out hate but didn't like). Character motivations didn't make any sense, Lex was annoying as s***, editing was sloppy, and it was overly dark and broody for an action superhero movie. A year + a half, five Marvel films, a ton of bad reviews and a Justice League later a thought popped into my head: \"what if I watched BVS again\". This time I didn't have trailers ruining the best moments, I only vaguely remembered the film, and I was conditioned to look at it negatively but something unexpected happened: I actually loved it. Superman was just a normal person that tried to make a difference cause he could that others imposed their own beliefs on. Lex Luthor was a genius that couldn't stand his powerlessness compared to Superman or more accurately a super being. As Alfred said \"The fever, the rage, the feeling of powerlessness that turns good men... cruel\" and you see the same thought process in Batman. Batman, just like Lex Luthor feels powerless in the midst of a god-being and just like Lex he attempts to destroy him so he can get his sense of power back but unlike Lex, Batman learns something. I what is one of the corniest lines of the movie Superman says, \"Martha\" when he knows he can't win against Batman in a late desperate attempt to save his mother. Not only does this name connect with Bruce Wayne but it also shows what really matters to a man of steel: it isn't power, it isn't fame or anything else, it is his Mother and on a broader scale it is people. Lex (who doesn't care about people at all) knows he doesn't have the power so he creates something from his blood and the remains of Zod: A Doomsday for Superman. Not only does this film have depth but it also doesn't always explain it to you which is rare in a blockbuster action superhero flick normally cater to semi-comic book fans and people that want to shove popcorn in their mouths. This film rewards you for really noticing the details while still having massive explosions. One of my favorites is how Lex has all of Batman's branded killed which is why he isn't afraid of the branding at the end or Grandma's Peach Tea as a way of scaring the s*** out of someone. Of course, this film isn't perfect and I do have personal dislikes. The Batman V Superman fight was slow and pretty boring especially after watching such an amazing fight in Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 2 (If you haven't watched the animated Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 1 and 2 you are sorely missing out on something fantastic). Also, the addition of Wonder Woman who pretty much steals a hacker thing, gives it back and then suits up and fights against a giant monster thing. Not to say I don't like Wonder Woman (She is one of my favorite Superheroes of all time who showed not only can woman kick a** but they also don't need to be ashamed of their sexuality or gender) but she wasn't really that helpful to the plot and just brought in to expand the universe which was well done through Lex's superhuman hunting files. Also, the post-apocalyptic scene that was just a dream could have been cut but nothing is perfect except movies like Citizen Kane which isn't a lot of fun to watch cause it is too perfect. So to summarize, the theatrical cut is bad, the ultimate cut is Amazing and the other cut is meh. Please give it a second chance because it deserves it and save a good director from losing grace because of something he didn't do."
"I really liked it, don't know what all the hate is about. I'm actually a Marvel fan from when I was 7 or so, but Superman and Batman together in 1 movie? Just great. And personally I like Ben Affleck even better than Christian Bale as Batman. So just watch and enjoy, I know I did!"

"That's right. We have been waiting for these two heroes to finally meet and fight against each other. This movie is so good in both plot and special effects.Henry Cavill and Ben Affleck have performed well in their acting stages. They are the best superhero actors and they have filmed their fighting scenes very well. The movie starts to show the conflict between the lives of the heroes and now they have blamed each other for it. This movie is amazing and sets up a good plot for Dawn Justice."

"Actually...I didn't know what to expect. When you see Wonder Woman, you know it will be off of Wonder Woman and off of a Wonder Woman story, but with Batman V Superman, I was like, \"hmmmm, so who is this about?\" It was pretty obvious that it would feature many characters, but I thought the introduction to Batman was amazing. Ben Affleck nailed the part, not only as Batman but also as Bruce Wayne. He is my Batman. Henry Cavill continued to be super as the Man of Steel. And he is my Super - Man. A dark story? Yes, without a doubt. Could it have had a few more jokes? Sure. But not all movies or stories need to have jokes when certain events are serious. I really hope people can see this review and take another look at the movie, because, I loved it. I really hope the ratings can go up, eventually. And P.S, this movie is the perfect set up to Justice League."

"I'll start by making it clear I have only ever seen the Ultimate Edition. I'm aware of what was cut out for the theatrical release, so I will concede up front that most of the criticisms about pacing, editing, and missing bits of plot at release were merited.With that caveat out of the way, I must reiterate that this was bar-none the boldest superhero movie I have ever seen. To me, it was arguably the best as well, though \"best\" shouldn't be taken to mean \"most enjoyable.\" That honor easily goes to \"Thor: Ragnarok.\" What makes BvS stand out among other films in the genre is that it takes two characters who have been done to death since the 1970s and brings them up to date. I recently tried to watch \"Superman: The Movie\" for the first time in a number of years, and while it was still good and Reeves will always be iconic, I just couldn't take it seriously. I'll put it this way: If the story in BvS was \"stupid\" in your view but Superman turning back time by spinning the earth backward on its axis didn't seem like one of the dumbest things you have ever seen -in any movie from any genre- to the extent that it outright ruins the movie for you, then your opinion about BvS isn't worth much. Nostalgic bias was always going to be a problem for this movie, and the way people reacted to and reviewed \"Man of Steel\" was telling in this regard.That brings me to Zack Snyder's take on Superman. You know, that guy whose status as the first extraterrestrial ever encountered by humanity was a total non-issue in the old movies. Apparently, Snyder has a similar view to my own in that his take on the Man of Steel makes his being an alien a core piece of his identity. He may look like any other (absurdly attractive) person, but he knows what he is, and that makes him perpetually uncertain of where he fits in this world. He is essentially good and really does care about people, but he struggles to truly empathize with the likes of us. To be human is to be frail, and that is not something he can easily relate to. This is the root of his conflict with Batman.Just as Clark struggles to genuinely relate to most people, Snyder's Batman either refuses to or otherwise just can't relate to Superman. He doesn't see him as anything but a threat regardless of Superman's clear good intentions. Remember, a small group of Kryptonians were able to bring humanity to the brink of extinction in less than a day, and Bruce Wayne is nothing if not a realist. He didn't know the guy from Kansas. He only knew the god from another world.While Batman's anger toward and fear of Superman are readily apparent from the start, Superman's inability to imagine things from Bruce Wayne's perspective only becomes truly apparent during their first real interaction. This reminded me of the animated version of the \"world's finest\" storyline, where Superman judges Batman harshly for using fear tactics and threats of violence (also, actual violence) to get the job done. Superman wasn't willing to consider what it would take for a human man to fight criminals and save innocents, or what that life would do to him over time. Just as Batman didn't see the guy from Kansas, Superman didn't see the man who lives his life trapped in one brutal, unthinkably traumatic moment (this was beautifully conveyed during the film's opening moments), and had spent his whole adult life bearing witness to humanity at its absolute worst.The conflict between these two characters is as old as human history. They want the same things, but they can't understand one another. So they fight. And what a fight it was.Watching a fight between, say, Captain America and Iron Man was, to me, more frustrating than anything because each understood the other's perspective perfectly. The fight between Batman and Superman in BvS was genuinely gut-wrenching, as intended, because they would have understood one another if either had tried. The whole sequence hilighted Batman's tactical prowess and ability to control a situation. Maybe the most badass thing about the fight was that it ended exactly where Batman planned. That brings me to the big elephant in the room named \"Martha.\"I can't recall exactly which YouTuber put it this way, but if you thought the \"save Martha\" exchange was about their mothers having the same name, you had your brain turned off. The brain-on people have explained this to death, but it bears repeating. This was the moment when Superman became humanized to Batman. He was about to die, and his only concern was for his adoptive human mother. He still believed that the man about to take his life would do the right thing. Even with the cowl on, there was no mistaking the look on Batman's face. It was the look of shame, guilt, and sudden uncertainty that says \"What am I doing?\" Turns out even the most brutal, angry version of Bruce Wayne is better than Tony Stark at knowing right from wrong. At knowing that he had gone too far.From there, the third act was a series of truly impressive (albeit mostly CGI) fight sequences, beginning with what I regard as the undisputed champion of Batman fights. Nothing in the Nolan movies (and especially nothing in the Burton movies) even came close. Go ahead, try to convince yourself that Batman and Bane taking turns punching one another in the face until Bane's mask broke was a good fight sequence. No, this was a fight straight out of \"Arkham Knight,\" and it was glorious. The battle against Doomsday really was one for the books. From the moment Wonder Woman arrived accompanied by the intense sounds of Tina Guo's electric cello to Superman's tragic, heroic death at the hands of Doomsday, I was glued to the screen. Sure, the mere presence of Doomsday spoiled the end to a degree, but watching the Man of Steel laboring to carry that kryptonite spear towards certain death was no less impactful. A brief word on Jesse Eisenberg's take on Lex Luthor. At least one other reviewer on this site already said it best when they pointed out that this was his origin story. If you consider his scheme objectively, he is actually one of the more formidable incarnations of the character. If we're lucky, we'll eventually get to see a Snyder Cut of \"Justice League\" and find out where this story was actually meant to go. For the record, Joss Whedon and Danny Elfman both should have said \"no\" to taking a dump on someone else's art."
"BATMAN V SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE brings a fantastic surprise to a smash-hit team-up with one of the worlds most beloved DC Comics' icons of all time. The movie delivers spectacular casting, and fantastic acting with different characters having their shine in each scenes.The story follows Clark Kent/Superman who becomes a threat, after the destruction in Metropolis in Man Of Steel.(2013). Batman/Bruce Wayne sees him as a threat and begins his war on Superman.The movie brings spectacular storytelling, it tells the complications of human against alien who are on the same side, and the first meeting of Batman and Superman. The story of Bruce Wayne, with his many years of The Caped Crusader, sends him on a spiral of \"out of control\", sheer anger, and builds tension to wanting to defeat the Man of Steel. Snyder has fantastically gave this storytelling an exciting nod to the comics.Lex Luthor, played by Jesse Einsberg, delivers a very interesting performance, but very differently by him showing is his \"origin\" before he becomes a bald foe to the Man of Steel. He shows that his love of \"god vs man\" terrorises mankind when he ultimately creates Doomsday, and Batman realises Superman's inner heroism.It packs so many great \"out of nowhere\" excitement, including a first-look of the fearful Wonder Woman a.k.a. Diana Prince, played by Gal Gadot, and a fresh-new glimpse of the superhero DC canon: The Justice League.WATCH THIS MOVIE! The critics are out of their mind. It's a fun-packed action adventure which still keeps the movie enjoyable until it's final minutes of the movie. It's a FANTASTIC MOVIE! BEN AFFLECK AS BATMAN... is Incredible!A 10/10 overall!"
"I want to go on record as saying that this is a truly thrilling cinematic experience in so many ways. If pressed, I guess I could acknowledge that there were a couple ... let's say \"clumsy\" moments. And in a film that runs to three hours, that hardly seems like a significant issue, certainly not enough to rate it with fewer than 9 stars.This film has everything. There is dramatic tension right from the start. There is a magnificent story arc that picks up quite seamlessly from 'Man of Steel' and propels the viewer not only into the life of Clark Kent/Superman but also of Bruce Wayne/Batman.The villain is no mere cartoon of a villain; he is truly thoroughly (and apparently irrevocably) diabolical. He is a psychopath, and you wish for his death over and over and over. You want Superman to reduce him to ash with the power of his eyes.I have read a number of viewers' reviews, and it seems that the people who disliked the film / gave it a low rating had rather unfair and unrealistic expectations of it. That is, their own prejudices about how the plot could/should unfold or what the character development could/should be, etc. ruined the film for them. And that is a shame.My thought is: I settle into my seat, wait for the lights to dim, and then I wait to be transported by the film. I accept it, lock, stock, and barrel.As another reviewer remarked, I love how the film begins from the point of view of Bruce Wayne as he is among people on the ground who have fallen victim to the attack of Zod and the other Kryptonians.Why would Bruce Wayne not like Superman? Why would the good people of Earth hurl insults at Superman and burn him in effigy (on the news)? Because the good people of Earth just got catapulted into a new reality in which there are not only extraterrestrial beings (surprise!) but they are also superman! And a group of them are hell-bent on destroying humankind and taking the planet for themselves.It is difficult to see Superman as separate from the whole Kryptonian Krew.It seems that many moviegoers forgot that Bruce Wayne is also human. Sure, he's a hero, but he is flawed.. Just like the rest of us. He is a vigilante, after all.He has let his vigilantism get the better of him. HE is actually the one working outside the boundaries of the law, not Superman. It is the clear head of Alfred that shows us that he has gone into a rather dark place, that he has not seen what is really going on (in Luthor's scheme), and so he chooses to embark on his own scheme scheme to take out the alien invader. He is (allegedly) thinking of the future: if he wipes out the all-powerful alien, then it can't turn on humankind in the future. At least, he convinces himself of that.A philosophical question is raised in the film: should Clark Kent have remained a simple man from Kansas and never have become the Superman? Should he just let people die and let calamities happen? The question is answered for us in the character of Diana Prince/Wonder Woman. She withdrew from mankind (her exact words) and just sat around watching. Watching while people died horrible deaths all around her. So, should Superman have done the same? Do these special beings, these 'metahumans', have some kind of moral imperative to intervene, or should they be allowed to be regular people, too? It seems that humans want it both ways.It seems that humans are saying: \"Don't be a superalien ... except when I and my friends and family are in trouble. Then come save us.\""

"Batman v Superman: Ultimate Edition: If your looking for a quick, cheap thrill then you might not enjoy this film at the time. This movies theatrical version was butchered by WB and in doing so reshaped the story leaving numerous plot holes. So the Ultimate Edition is the full story and the one worth seeing. Watch 'Man of Steel' before seeing this movie. There is much to claw through here, so much so that the audience might easily find themselves exhausted from the overall aggression of the film. However, a lot of the story does work. The action is good, and the emotion feels real most of the time.This film is about Superman trying to become Superman. Trying to help the world, save people, find a place in this world not as an outcast, and yet is looked at has a threat by many. Superman is not from this world, yet He is trying to be human, find a place in this world, be excepted by earths people, and come into his destiny.This film is also about Batman being Batman for 20 years and losing faith in humanity, and fearing Superman, what Superman can do with his powers. Great film, great plot, great visuals. ---Yidioo"
"I didn't see the film in the theaters and just bought the \"Extended Edition \" on Amazon. I never properly saw Man of Steel- i think I rented it and watched it when already exhausted and fell asleep. I saw the mediocre user reviews and horrible reviews from critics of this film.They really have it wrong. This is the very best either Batman or Superman. It has a different take, on things. Much darker then earlier films even darker then the Christopher Nolan Batman films.First of all Christopher Nolan is an Executive Producer. So how bad could it be? I loved Sucker Punch and Zack Snyder was involved with that. So how bad could this be? Hans Zimmer did the music, so how bad could it be?I remember watching the old Superman TV shows and reading the Superman and Batman comics as a little kid and loved them, but i wouldn't call myself a \"fan boy\" of comic universes, like so many younger people today. As an older adult I will admit my favorite TV show of all time was Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but watched it on DVD only after it had finished. I saw the second of the Dark Knight series in the theater, but the other two, I watched on DVD. They were great, but not my favorite films like so many people. i also loved the first couple Superman and Batman films in the older series. Regardless, i was not waiting with baited breath to see Man of Steel or this one.I'm more of a serious film fan, who can watch Stanley Kubrick films over and over and my favorite films in the last twenty years, are Eyes Wide Shut and Intersteller, both of which i've watched multiple times.So, with that said, take it from me, the critics have this film very wrong, just as critics hated 2001: A Space Odyssey when it first came out. This film will have lasting appreciation.Surprised how much I liked Ben Afleck's Batman. it was hard to get into Henry Cavil's scrawnier looking Superman, but it grew on me. Amy Adams was great as Lois Lane, The Gal Gadol Wonder Women was amazing. Lex Luther was terrific, like Nolan's Joker. Jeremy Irons was the best Alfred ever. Holly Hunter and Diane Lane was good too. The movie had bad reviews but made a billion dollars. Hopefully everyone buys the Ultimate Edition and it breaks sales records and the film is re-appreciated. I have no idea what scenes this Ultimate Edition added, but it is pretty perfect. Now I can't wait for Wonder Woman and the Justice League and as soon as I finish writing this am going to watch Man of Steal. I'm into it now!I can only surmise that the bad reviews stem from too much expectations of the rigid fan boy types and the radical changes in tone, we see in this film.Total masterpiece of cinema, but I have a few criticisms. There are a few hollow scenes of typical Idiot cops and authorities getting everything wrong in a cliché type way and it has a few filler scenes of that type and a few moments here and there that felt rushed and cheesy. Maybe not everything restored into the Ultimate Edition should have been. I wish there had been more Kevin Costner scenes."

"The whole entire Batman V Superman movie was great and yes even though it felt slow to the majority of the people who watched it but to me I enjoyed every part and every scene of Batman V Superman and when it got to the fight scenes both batman VS Superman and the Doomsday fight it brought so much drama, intensity, and epic performances. So with that being said I give this movie a good 10/10 because it really did go to my expectations and it brought a powerful performance and a powerful yet epic introduction to the upcoming Justice League."

"When I first wrote a review for this movie a year ago exclaiming my excitement for the film, I had been high off a fresh dose of live-action DC superheroes playing out the beloved comic book stories that I had grown up on. It was all playing out before my eyes and coming to life. After a few months had passed, I began to notice things about the movie that I disliked: little gaps in the story, things that didn't add up, etc. My original rating of a 10 / 10 dropped to an 8 /10. But today it has gone back up to a 10. The extended version of the film not only rectifies the gaps but also silences critics.Many claimed that the movie was too dark or that it just didn't make sense. To those people, I say: \"Pick up a comic book!\" Many of the critics of this particular film were part of the superhero bandwagon that formed when Marvel began its spree of Avengers-related films. In fact, its estimated that over 60% of people who go to see 'superhero' genre films have never picked up a comic book in their life. I would argue that similar numbers could figure to those which view the CW televised DC Universe shows. People complain that DC comics is just too dark but the fact is that these movies are based upon actual comics which are meant to be dark (ex: The Dark Knight Returns, Injustice, etc.). Its like complaining that Game of Thrones (the TV series) sucks because they kill off too many characters. Read the books! Its frustrating to see such a beautiful work of art like Batman V Superman criticized by those ignorant to its universe and its meaning. This movie is in fact a catalyst that opens numerous doorways and leaves true fans in awe of the possibilities for future movies. But regardless of whether or not people choose to educate themselves, this film's DVD/Blu-ray extended version puts the theater release to shame. All of the plot holes and gaps are filled in 30 minutes of extended footage scattered throughout the film. The movie ultimately becomes more complete and people will wish that the movie had shown the full 3 hours of footage in its theatrical debut. As a major DC comics fan, I will of course pick up on things that a comics fan would not, but someone who does not read comics would learn to appreciate this film in its entirety with the extended version. Get your hands on a copy today or find it on Netflix or the internet somewhere!"

"I ignored the bad reviews and watched anyways. This film had a lot to live up to after Civil War was released and I went into this film expecting the worst. It ended up to be the best Superhero film of 2016 to me. One complaint was that this film was more concerned about universe building than telling a great story than Civil War but for me it was the other way around; Civil War felt like a build up to something else and to be honest, I felt that way when I saw the other MCU films. Batman vs Superman however not only had a great story, but it also felt a lot more consistent than Civil War. This film was way more diverse with the cast than the MCU but unlike the MCU, I felt like this film doesn't go overboard with the SJW stuff like the MCU films or The Star Wars Sequel films do. The Visuals were AMAZING, The Score by Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL was AMAZING as well, The Tone is just right as I actually felt for the characters emotionally, The Cinematography kept my eyes glued to the screen, and the script felt really Intelligent and Complex and despite people calling the writing confusing, I was able to piece it together with no problem whatsoever. This film is similar to Empire Strikes back in terms of popularity so over time after the other movies are released, this movie would probably be more popular.This film was way better than I Expected and deserves another chance.

"Its shame to see what critics and marvel fans did to this movie and targeted Zack Snyder for it. I have seen this movie more than 25 times till date. And i enjoy this movie as much as i enjoyed the first time. The fans who have read DC comics, wouldn't be disappointed in this movie. Its dark movie, yes it is. Because the title shows the intense situation at hand. Two superheroes about to rip each other apart for whatever reasons that brought them to this stage. Yes it had to be dark and intense.Only marvel can be stupid enough to show an alien invasion where humans are loosing the battle and the super heroes are cracking jokes while battles as if they are playing ping pong. a person playing Call of Duty game is more serious while playing than the marvel heroes fighting aliens."

"Last week some news came out from somebody online who had claimed to have seen a finished version of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. If you were like me, you've been leery of checking it out because you weren't sure how much might actually be true. Now Zack Snyder has spoken out about the spoiler-filled post, although his response doesn't really clear anything up.In a word, to MTV, he called the post \"hilarious,which might imply that he's saying that it's mostly, if not entirely, untrue. That might be the case, but then again he could have just said it was untrue and he didn't say that. What he did say, however, is that he doesn't like spoilers. While this may seem odd for the director who's most recent trailer appeared to give away the entire movie, Snyder says that's not the case. Even if you've seen the trailer, you can rest easy, as there is much more we have not seen in then finished film. Says Snyder I have the benefit of seeing the movie. It's cool that think it's too much, and I appreciate people not wanting to know, but there's plenty that they don't know. There's a lot of movie that's not in the trailer. In the process of calling the Batman v Superman Reddit review hilarious, Snyder goes on to talk about how he hates it when spoilers come out. The director would much rather that fans see the movie mostly blind. While he understands that some fans may wish to find the answers before hand, he wants his movies to be mysteries going in. If you're, as an audience member, exploring these articles, looking for answers to questions that you have, maybe you're okay with knowing before you go. It's like an individual taste. But like I said, I want people to see the movie without knowing.Spoilers are a topic that mean different things to different people. While most try to avoid them to some degree, the need to solve the mystery is a nearly universal human experience. We have an inclination to want to know the truth, even while also wanting to be surprised. For most of us getting some information is good, but getting all the information is bad, of course, only getting the details that you want can be difficult."
"The theatrical is choppy, poorly edited, hard to follow, with some really good moments mixed in their. The extended is much more fluent and is much easier to follow, it does have a long runtime, which might make it seem a bit dragging on, but if you like long films done right, like Lord of the Rings, you will like this movie as long as you get into the characters and story. Speaking of which, the story starts out perfectly showing Bruce Wayne as a character, and it is very powerful. There are several moments in this movie that are powerful, emotional, and shocking. Characters. Batman is my favorite fictional character of all time, and believe me when I say, Ben Affleck as Batman was perfect, he had the charisma, the anger, and the look of being through some bad stuff Gal Gadot also does perfect as Wonder Woman, but if you want to really see how good she does, go watch the Wonder Woman movie. Henry Call as Superman. I really don't like it when people say Christopher Reeves is better. Don't get me wrong, Reeves does great, but can you imagine him as Superman in this movie? I wouldn't like it. It would be like Adam West playing Batman in The Dark Knight. Henry Cavill does great in this role, I can say everything about him as I said with Ben Affleck. Jesse Eisenberg as Luthor. I thought it was different in a good way. I've heard a criticism for him as being too much like Joker, but is that a bad thing? Joker is my favorite villain, so to see Superman have an enemy that crazy, but still hold the values Luthor needs to be Luthor, I think it is great. The thing I thought this movie was lacking in the first and second acts was humor, at least good humor. If there was more humor, I would've given this movie a ten because it would give a more relaxing feel to the parts that needed it. All in all though, this movie was awesome, it had powerful moments, it was badass, and just plain fun. It had a great story arc and does its job very well."

"*I will be talking about the Ultimate Edition of the film* This was one of the most anticipated CBM of all time. Ever since the arrival and subsequent success of Marvel's The Avengers people have wondered when will DC launch its own cinematic universe, one of the main reasons being the opportunity to finally see titans such as Batman and Superman share the screen together: the ultimate nerd dream. On 2016, the moment finally came for BvS to be released AND.. it performed poorly. Not only did critical reception left a lot to be desired, but fan reactions where surprisingly split after its cinematic debut. People either loved it and called Zack a genius, or hated it and called him a hack. Me, personally, I found myself with middle of the road feelings, for sure, but more leaning towards the negative side with subsequent viewings. The theatrical cut of the film showcased amazing performances, incredible visuals, and action set pieces that seemed like comic book panels come to life, in a good way. However, when it comes to its narrative structure and more technical aspects like editing, the film was seriously flawed. More plot holes than Age of Ultron, questionable character decisions, random editing that lacked cohesion and focus, and forced dramatic moments that lacked any impact because the attempts at character development ranged from limited to nonexistent, especially when it comes to Superman's character. I thought it was a 5/10 movie at best. As such, I was kind of skeptical about the idea of a 30 minute longer version. I say kind of because I know how Zack works. I remember Watchmen being vastly improved with its director's cut, so in a way I was expecting BvS to perform in a similar manner, but I also feared those 30 minutes wold be just there to amplify action and discredit storytelling issues. Oh boy, I'm so glad I was proved wrong. The ultimate cut of the film was infuriating, but not because it was awful, but because it questions the sanity of WB executives and editors and makes you wonder what were they thinking during the editing process. What I got out of the Ultimate Edition was a thought-provoking deconstruction of two very iconic superheroes that gave spotlight to the struggles both of them face when they aren't fighting crime. What I got was an extremely well produced character study on both Batman and Superman in a cynical world, a world dangerously close to our own. We meet Batman as a ruthless, worn out hero that has seen the failure behind his ideals and witnessed some truly horrifying things in his life. Superman, on the other hand, is portrayed as a godlike figure that seeks to do good in the world, but finds himself emotionally conflicted once he realized that every good deed he does leaves behind a trail of destruction (most of it due to Luthor's antics). In my opinion, this is a hugely original approach, one that distances itself from the rest of the competition and delivers a dark, somber, yet relevant superhero movie that understands both characters and gives them real human struggles to deal with. I felt invested in both of them, and hoped that by the end of the film both could find a way to redeem themselves. Their character arcs were very well established during the first two acts of the movie, and by the time we get to the titular climactic battle the emotion behind the jaw-dropping action is intensified. Lex Luthor as a villain was also given more time to develop with this new edition. One of the main criticisms with the original version was the fact that his plan relied too much on conveniences, and the character's mannerisms and mad-scientist attitude was annoying, and that goes without saying his motivations were unclear. Not only do we spend more time understanding his hate for any godlike figure and thus his hatred for Superman, but the added scenes allowed us to witness his entire plan come to fruition. It sells the cold, manipulative, calculating attributes of his comic counterpart. The acting is spot on. Every actor owns his/her role, from Cavill's Superman, to Ben Affleck as Batman, Eisenberg as Luthor, and Gadot as Wonder Woman, whose scenes are brief, but are more than enough to sell the strong and ferocious warrior that she is. Cinematography is stunning, and miles above that of Man of Steel's. And the soundtrack by Zimmer and Junkie XL? Perfect, just perfect. When it comes to flaws, the film still has some of those. The Martha moment, while serving as a pivotal character moment for Batman, felt off in execution, and its understandable that many people got mad at it. If your main complaint about BvS the first time around was its bleak tone and subject matter, this film is still not for you. I understand most were expecting to see the heroes being the most iconic versions of themselves, clashing in an elongated battle and evoking the same feelings The Avengers gave audiences back in 2012. In that sense, the film will remain divisive, but at least I have the comfort of saying that, at the very least, the film is competently made."

"This film was amazing. Ben Affleck was easily the best part of this movie, he brought his a-game as Batman. The chemistry between Affleck & Irons was outstanding. Gal Gadot did a great job as Wonder Woman. The fight between Batman & Superman was awesome. The final fight with Doomsday was outstanding in every way possible. However, there is only one problem with this film and that's Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor. He was sadly missed cast in this role, but then again it's really the fault of Warner Bros. Studios. Overall, this film deliver on almost every level. I highly recommend that you watch the extended version of this film."

"I know I know. I saw it in theaters too, and felt like it could've been so much better. While the Batman element was good, the narrative felt fractured, and the third act was just one long stunt scene. Superman was relegated to a supporting character, and other characters didn't get a chance to shine. And then I chanced on the ultimate cut. Calling it 30 mins of \"extra\" footage is unfair to Zack Snyder because it's exactly these 30 mins that makes the movie a worthy one. What I can say about the theatrical cut is this - It had the blockbuster elements - music, visuals, stunts, CGI. But, it lacked the human elements. The first 20 mins of the movie had it, but not after that. The extended cut in comparison has a flow to the narrative. There are no disjointed scenes, everything flows smoothly, and there's connective tissue. Superman gets to spend some time with his father, and mother. Clark Kent does some investigative journalism. Superman helps the people after the blast. Lois Lane doesn't jump to conclusions, she gets to the bottom of the crime. Lex Luthor apparently had a coherent plan - everything is explained pretty well. Wonder Woman was already good, so there's no change there :) Also, the \"Martha\" scene seems better executed, because it is a few seconds longer, and there's time to breathe it in. So, here's my take on this movie - The theatrical cut was junk. Get the Bluray for ultimate edition, and you shall not be disappointed. I've seen it so many more times now, and it's the definitive cut. It is the movie we deserve. It's a unique take on Batman, and Superman. It's a gritty take on the superhero movie genre, and definitely the best DCEU movie, and the best DC movie since The Dark Knight.P.S. Yes it's dark. We're adults, and we should appreciate mature film making without intentionally silly moments. It attempts to be philosophical, and something deep instead of just trying to make you chuckle."

"This is one of the best superhero movies ever made. Zack Snyder is a magician behind the camera.The reason behind so many complaints is the fact that Warner Bros. marketed this movie as a fight between Batman and Superman. That's not what it is. It's a movie about the origins of the Justice League.The cinematography, the acting and the score are all second to none. This film is phenomenal.P.S: watch the 3 hour extended cut that Snyder intended you to see, not the 2 and a half hour movie that Warner Bros. decided would be better for theaters."

"I don't care what the critics say, this is a very well-done movie. I'll start my review by listing what I like about the movie.1.) Ben Affleck is the best batman to me and it is not close. He pulls off the role of an aging batman extremely well. Also, Zack Snyder's vision of batman is legit. I have always hated batman up until this adaptation of him. Instead of being a conflicted and idealistic batman, this batman is dark, gritty, and 100% a badass. His equipment is decked out with machine guns and he has no aversion to killing people. In fact, he probably kills about 50 criminal by the time this movie is over. The warehouse scene is the coolest batman scene in any movie.2.) The development of a grudge between batman and superman is pulled off flawlessly. It actually makes sense why batman dislikes superman. Then, when they do fight it is about the coolest thing you can expect to see from a superhero film. 3.) I disagree with a lot of people about Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor. In my opinion, he played his role to perfection. 4.) B v S sets up Wonder Woman and Justice League with Gal Gadot's cameo as Wonder Woman and short clips of Aquaman, the Flash, and Cyborg. B v S is one of my favorite superhero films and rewatching it never gets old."

"The theatrical cut of this film is garbage which is why I rated it eight stars instead of nine. The first time I watched this film I didn't like it (not straight out hate but didn't like). Character motivations didn't make any sense, Lex was annoying as s***, editing was sloppy, and it was overly dark and broody for an action superhero movie. A year + a half, five Marvel films, a ton of bad reviews and a Justice League later a thought popped into my head: \"what if I watched BVS again\". This time I didn't have trailers ruining the best moments, I only vaguely remembered the film, and I was conditioned to look at it negatively but something unexpected happened: I actually loved it. Superman was just a normal person that tried to make a difference cause he could that others imposed their own beliefs on. Lex Luthor was a genius that couldn't stand his powerlessness compared to Superman or more accurately a super being. As Alfred said \"The fever, the rage, the feeling of powerlessness that turns good men... cruel\" and you see the same thought process in Batman. Batman, just like Lex Luthor feels powerless in the midst of a god-being and just like Lex he attempts to destroy him so he can get his sense of power back but unlike Lex, Batman learns something. I what is one of the corniest lines of the movie Superman says, \"Martha\" when he knows he can't win against Batman in a late desperate attempt to save his mother. Not only does this name connect with Bruce Wayne but it also shows what really matters to a man of steel: it isn't power, it isn't fame or anything else, it is his Mother and on a broader scale it is people. Lex (who doesn't care about people at all) knows he doesn't have the power so he creates something from his blood and the remains of Zod: A Doomsday for Superman. Not only does this film have depth but it also doesn't always explain it to you which is rare in a blockbuster action superhero flick normally cater to semi-comic book fans and people that want to shove popcorn in their mouths. This film rewards you for really noticing the details while still having massive explosions. One of my favorites is how Lex has all of Batman's branded killed which is why he isn't afraid of the branding at the end or Grandma's Peach Tea as a way of scaring the s*** out of someone. Of course, this film isn't perfect and I do have personal dislikes. The Batman V Superman fight was slow and pretty boring especially after watching such an amazing fight in Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 2 (If you haven't watched the animated Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 1 and 2 you are sorely missing out on something fantastic). Also, the addition of Wonder Woman who pretty much steals a hacker thing, gives it back and then suits up and fights against a giant monster thing. Not to say I don't like Wonder Woman (She is one of my favorite Superheroes of all time who showed not only can woman kick a** but they also don't need to be ashamed of their sexuality or gender) but she wasn't really that helpful to the plot and just brought in to expand the universe which was well done through Lex's superhuman hunting files. Also, the post-apocalyptic scene that was just a dream could have been cut but nothing is perfect except movies like Citizen Kane which isn't a lot of fun to watch cause it is too perfect. So to summarize, the theatrical cut is bad, the ultimate cut is Amazing and the other cut is meh. Please give it a second chance because it deserves it and save a good director from losing grace because of something he didn't do."
"I really liked it, don't know what all the hate is about. I'm actually a Marvel fan from when I was 7 or so, but Superman and Batman together in 1 movie? Just great. And personally I like Ben Affleck even better than Christian Bale as Batman. So just watch and enjoy, I know I did!"

"That's right. We have been waiting for these two heroes to finally meet and fight against each other. This movie is so good in both plot and special effects.Henry Cavill and Ben Affleck have performed well in their acting stages. They are the best superhero actors and they have filmed their fighting scenes very well. The movie starts to show the conflict between the lives of the heroes and now they have blamed each other for it. This movie is amazing and sets up a good plot for Dawn Justice."

"Actually...I didn't know what to expect. When you see Wonder Woman, you know it will be off of Wonder Woman and off of a Wonder Woman story, but with Batman V Superman, I was like, \"hmmmm, so who is this about?\" It was pretty obvious that it would feature many characters, but I thought the introduction to Batman was amazing. Ben Affleck nailed the part, not only as Batman but also as Bruce Wayne. He is my Batman. Henry Cavill continued to be super as the Man of Steel. And he is my Super - Man. A dark story? Yes, without a doubt. Could it have had a few more jokes? Sure. But not all movies or stories need to have jokes when certain events are serious. I really hope people can see this review and take another look at the movie, because, I loved it. I really hope the ratings can go up, eventually. And P.S, this movie is the perfect set up to Justice League."

"I'll start by making it clear I have only ever seen the Ultimate Edition. I'm aware of what was cut out for the theatrical release, so I will concede up front that most of the criticisms about pacing, editing, and missing bits of plot at release were merited.With that caveat out of the way, I must reiterate that this was bar-none the boldest superhero movie I have ever seen. To me, it was arguably the best as well, though \"best\" shouldn't be taken to mean \"most enjoyable.\" That honor easily goes to \"Thor: Ragnarok.\" What makes BvS stand out among other films in the genre is that it takes two characters who have been done to death since the 1970s and brings them up to date. I recently tried to watch \"Superman: The Movie\" for the first time in a number of years, and while it was still good and Reeves will always be iconic, I just couldn't take it seriously. I'll put it this way: If the story in BvS was \"stupid\" in your view but Superman turning back time by spinning the earth backward on its axis didn't seem like one of the dumbest things you have ever seen -in any movie from any genre- to the extent that it outright ruins the movie for you, then your opinion about BvS isn't worth much. Nostalgic bias was always going to be a problem for this movie, and the way people reacted to and reviewed \"Man of Steel\" was telling in this regard.That brings me to Zack Snyder's take on Superman. You know, that guy whose status as the first extraterrestrial ever encountered by humanity was a total non-issue in the old movies. Apparently, Snyder has a similar view to my own in that his take on the Man of Steel makes his being an alien a core piece of his identity. He may look like any other (absurdly attractive) person, but he knows what he is, and that makes him perpetually uncertain of where he fits in this world. He is essentially good and really does care about people, but he struggles to truly empathize with the likes of us. To be human is to be frail, and that is not something he can easily relate to. This is the root of his conflict with Batman.Just as Clark struggles to genuinely relate to most people, Snyder's Batman either refuses to or otherwise just can't relate to Superman. He doesn't see him as anything but a threat regardless of Superman's clear good intentions. Remember, a small group of Kryptonians were able to bring humanity to the brink of extinction in less than a day, and Bruce Wayne is nothing if not a realist. He didn't know the guy from Kansas. He only knew the god from another world.While Batman's anger toward and fear of Superman are readily apparent from the start, Superman's inability to imagine things from Bruce Wayne's perspective only becomes truly apparent during their first real interaction. This reminded me of the animated version of the \"world's finest\" storyline, where Superman judges Batman harshly for using fear tactics and threats of violence (also, actual violence) to get the job done. Superman wasn't willing to consider what it would take for a human man to fight criminals and save innocents, or what that life would do to him over time. Just as Batman didn't see the guy from Kansas, Superman didn't see the man who lives his life trapped in one brutal, unthinkably traumatic moment (this was beautifully conveyed during the film's opening moments), and had spent his whole adult life bearing witness to humanity at its absolute worst.The conflict between these two characters is as old as human history. They want the same things, but they can't understand one another. So they fight. And what a fight it was.Watching a fight between, say, Captain America and Iron Man was, to me, more frustrating than anything because each understood the other's perspective perfectly. The fight between Batman and Superman in BvS was genuinely gut-wrenching, as intended, because they would have understood one another if either had tried. The whole sequence hilighted Batman's tactical prowess and ability to control a situation. Maybe the most badass thing about the fight was that it ended exactly where Batman planned. That brings me to the big elephant in the room named \"Martha.\"I can't recall exactly which YouTuber put it this way, but if you thought the \"save Martha\" exchange was about their mothers having the same name, you had your brain turned off. The brain-on people have explained this to death, but it bears repeating. This was the moment when Superman became humanized to Batman. He was about to die, and his only concern was for his adoptive human mother. He still believed that the man about to take his life would do the right thing. Even with the cowl on, there was no mistaking the look on Batman's face. It was the look of shame, guilt, and sudden uncertainty that says \"What am I doing?\" Turns out even the most brutal, angry version of Bruce Wayne is better than Tony Stark at knowing right from wrong. At knowing that he had gone too far.From there, the third act was a series of truly impressive (albeit mostly CGI) fight sequences, beginning with what I regard as the undisputed champion of Batman fights. Nothing in the Nolan movies (and especially nothing in the Burton movies) even came close. Go ahead, try to convince yourself that Batman and Bane taking turns punching one another in the face until Bane's mask broke was a good fight sequence. No, this was a fight straight out of \"Arkham Knight,\" and it was glorious. The battle against Doomsday really was one for the books. From the moment Wonder Woman arrived accompanied by the intense sounds of Tina Guo's electric cello to Superman's tragic, heroic death at the hands of Doomsday, I was glued to the screen. Sure, the mere presence of Doomsday spoiled the end to a degree, but watching the Man of Steel laboring to carry that kryptonite spear towards certain death was no less impactful. A brief word on Jesse Eisenberg's take on Lex Luthor. At least one other reviewer on this site already said it best when they pointed out that this was his origin story. If you consider his scheme objectively, he is actually one of the more formidable incarnations of the character. If we're lucky, we'll eventually get to see a Snyder Cut of \"Justice League\" and find out where this story was actually meant to go. For the record, Joss Whedon and Danny Elfman both should have said \"no\" to taking a dump on someone else's art."
"BATMAN V SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE brings a fantastic surprise to a smash-hit team-up with one of the worlds most beloved DC Comics' icons of all time. The movie delivers spectacular casting, and fantastic acting with different characters having their shine in each scenes.The story follows Clark Kent/Superman who becomes a threat, after the destruction in Metropolis in Man Of Steel.(2013). Batman/Bruce Wayne sees him as a threat and begins his war on Superman.The movie brings spectacular storytelling, it tells the complications of human against alien who are on the same side, and the first meeting of Batman and Superman. The story of Bruce Wayne, with his many years of The Caped Crusader, sends him on a spiral of \"out of control\", sheer anger, and builds tension to wanting to defeat the Man of Steel. Snyder has fantastically gave this storytelling an exciting nod to the comics.Lex Luthor, played by Jesse Einsberg, delivers a very interesting performance, but very differently by him showing is his \"origin\" before he becomes a bald foe to the Man of Steel. He shows that his love of \"god vs man\" terrorises mankind when he ultimately creates Doomsday, and Batman realises Superman's inner heroism.It packs so many great \"out of nowhere\" excitement, including a first-look of the fearful Wonder Woman a.k.a. Diana Prince, played by Gal Gadot, and a fresh-new glimpse of the superhero DC canon: The Justice League.WATCH THIS MOVIE! The critics are out of their mind. It's a fun-packed action adventure which still keeps the movie enjoyable until it's final minutes of the movie. It's a FANTASTIC MOVIE! BEN AFFLECK AS BATMAN... is Incredible!A 10/10 overall!"
"I want to go on record as saying that this is a truly thrilling cinematic experience in so many ways. If pressed, I guess I could acknowledge that there were a couple ... let's say \"clumsy\" moments. And in a film that runs to three hours, that hardly seems like a significant issue, certainly not enough to rate it with fewer than 9 stars.This film has everything. There is dramatic tension right from the start. There is a magnificent story arc that picks up quite seamlessly from 'Man of Steel' and propels the viewer not only into the life of Clark Kent/Superman but also of Bruce Wayne/Batman.The villain is no mere cartoon of a villain; he is truly thoroughly (and apparently irrevocably) diabolical. He is a psychopath, and you wish for his death over and over and over. You want Superman to reduce him to ash with the power of his eyes.I have read a number of viewers' reviews, and it seems that the people who disliked the film / gave it a low rating had rather unfair and unrealistic expectations of it. That is, their own prejudices about how the plot could/should unfold or what the character development could/should be, etc. ruined the film for them. And that is a shame.My thought is: I settle into my seat, wait for the lights to dim, and then I wait to be transported by the film. I accept it, lock, stock, and barrel.As another reviewer remarked, I love how the film begins from the point of view of Bruce Wayne as he is among people on the ground who have fallen victim to the attack of Zod and the other Kryptonians.Why would Bruce Wayne not like Superman? Why would the good people of Earth hurl insults at Superman and burn him in effigy (on the news)? Because the good people of Earth just got catapulted into a new reality in which there are not only extraterrestrial beings (surprise!) but they are also superman! And a group of them are hell-bent on destroying humankind and taking the planet for themselves.It is difficult to see Superman as separate from the whole Kryptonian Krew.It seems that many moviegoers forgot that Bruce Wayne is also human. Sure, he's a hero, but he is flawed.. Just like the rest of us. He is a vigilante, after all.He has let his vigilantism get the better of him. HE is actually the one working outside the boundaries of the law, not Superman. It is the clear head of Alfred that shows us that he has gone into a rather dark place, that he has not seen what is really going on (in Luthor's scheme), and so he chooses to embark on his own scheme scheme to take out the alien invader. He is (allegedly) thinking of the future: if he wipes out the all-powerful alien, then it can't turn on humankind in the future. At least, he convinces himself of that.A philosophical question is raised in the film: should Clark Kent have remained a simple man from Kansas and never have become the Superman? Should he just let people die and let calamities happen? The question is answered for us in the character of Diana Prince/Wonder Woman. She withdrew from mankind (her exact words) and just sat around watching. Watching while people died horrible deaths all around her. So, should Superman have done the same? Do these special beings, these 'metahumans', have some kind of moral imperative to intervene, or should they be allowed to be regular people, too? It seems that humans want it both ways.It seems that humans are saying: \"Don't be a superalien ... except when I and my friends and family are in trouble. Then come save us.\""

"Batman v Superman: Ultimate Edition: If your looking for a quick, cheap thrill then you might not enjoy this film at the time. This movies theatrical version was butchered by WB and in doing so reshaped the story leaving numerous plot holes. So the Ultimate Edition is the full story and the one worth seeing. Watch 'Man of Steel' before seeing this movie. There is much to claw through here, so much so that the audience might easily find themselves exhausted from the overall aggression of the film. However, a lot of the story does work. The action is good, and the emotion feels real most of the time.This film is about Superman trying to become Superman. Trying to help the world, save people, find a place in this world not as an outcast, and yet is looked at has a threat by many. Superman is not from this world, yet He is trying to be human, find a place in this world, be excepted by earths people, and come into his destiny.This film is also about Batman being Batman for 20 years and losing faith in humanity, and fearing Superman, what Superman can do with his powers. Great film, great plot, great visuals. ---Yidioo"
"I didn't see the film in the theaters and just bought the \"Extended Edition \" on Amazon. I never properly saw Man of Steel- i think I rented it and watched it when already exhausted and fell asleep. I saw the mediocre user reviews and horrible reviews from critics of this film.They really have it wrong. This is the very best either Batman or Superman. It has a different take, on things. Much darker then earlier films even darker then the Christopher Nolan Batman films.First of all Christopher Nolan is an Executive Producer. So how bad could it be? I loved Sucker Punch and Zack Snyder was involved with that. So how bad could this be? Hans Zimmer did the music, so how bad could it be?I remember watching the old Superman TV shows and reading the Superman and Batman comics as a little kid and loved them, but i wouldn't call myself a \"fan boy\" of comic universes, like so many younger people today. As an older adult I will admit my favorite TV show of all time was Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but watched it on DVD only after it had finished. I saw the second of the Dark Knight series in the theater, but the other two, I watched on DVD. They were great, but not my favorite films like so many people. i also loved the first couple Superman and Batman films in the older series. Regardless, i was not waiting with baited breath to see Man of Steel or this one.I'm more of a serious film fan, who can watch Stanley Kubrick films over and over and my favorite films in the last twenty years, are Eyes Wide Shut and Intersteller, both of which i've watched multiple times.So, with that said, take it from me, the critics have this film very wrong, just as critics hated 2001: A Space Odyssey when it first came out. This film will have lasting appreciation.Surprised how much I liked Ben Afleck's Batman. it was hard to get into Henry Cavil's scrawnier looking Superman, but it grew on me. Amy Adams was great as Lois Lane, The Gal Gadol Wonder Women was amazing. Lex Luther was terrific, like Nolan's Joker. Jeremy Irons was the best Alfred ever. Holly Hunter and Diane Lane was good too. The movie had bad reviews but made a billion dollars. Hopefully everyone buys the Ultimate Edition and it breaks sales records and the film is re-appreciated. I have no idea what scenes this Ultimate Edition added, but it is pretty perfect. Now I can't wait for Wonder Woman and the Justice League and as soon as I finish writing this am going to watch Man of Steal. I'm into it now!I can only surmise that the bad reviews stem from too much expectations of the rigid fan boy types and the radical changes in tone, we see in this film.Total masterpiece of cinema, but I have a few criticisms. There are a few hollow scenes of typical Idiot cops and authorities getting everything wrong in a cliché type way and it has a few filler scenes of that type and a few moments here and there that felt rushed and cheesy. Maybe not everything restored into the Ultimate Edition should have been. I wish there had been more Kevin Costner scenes."

"The whole entire Batman V Superman movie was great and yes even though it felt slow to the majority of the people who watched it but to me I enjoyed every part and every scene of Batman V Superman and when it got to the fight scenes both batman VS Superman and the Doomsday fight it brought so much drama, intensity, and epic performances. So with that being said I give this movie a good 10/10 because it really did go to my expectations and it brought a powerful performance and a powerful yet epic introduction to the upcoming Justice League."

"When I first wrote a review for this movie a year ago exclaiming my excitement for the film, I had been high off a fresh dose of live-action DC superheroes playing out the beloved comic book stories that I had grown up on. It was all playing out before my eyes and coming to life. After a few months had passed, I began to notice things about the movie that I disliked: little gaps in the story, things that didn't add up, etc. My original rating of a 10 / 10 dropped to an 8 /10. But today it has gone back up to a 10. The extended version of the film not only rectifies the gaps but also silences critics.Many claimed that the movie was too dark or that it just didn't make sense. To those people, I say: \"Pick up a comic book!\" Many of the critics of this particular film were part of the superhero bandwagon that formed when Marvel began its spree of Avengers-related films. In fact, its estimated that over 60% of people who go to see 'superhero' genre films have never picked up a comic book in their life. I would argue that similar numbers could figure to those which view the CW televised DC Universe shows. People complain that DC comics is just too dark but the fact is that these movies are based upon actual comics which are meant to be dark (ex: The Dark Knight Returns, Injustice, etc.). Its like complaining that Game of Thrones (the TV series) sucks because they kill off too many characters. Read the books! Its frustrating to see such a beautiful work of art like Batman V Superman criticized by those ignorant to its universe and its meaning. This movie is in fact a catalyst that opens numerous doorways and leaves true fans in awe of the possibilities for future movies. But regardless of whether or not people choose to educate themselves, this film's DVD/Blu-ray extended version puts the theater release to shame. All of the plot holes and gaps are filled in 30 minutes of extended footage scattered throughout the film. The movie ultimately becomes more complete and people will wish that the movie had shown the full 3 hours of footage in its theatrical debut. As a major DC comics fan, I will of course pick up on things that a comics fan would not, but someone who does not read comics would learn to appreciate this film in its entirety with the extended version. Get your hands on a copy today or find it on Netflix or the internet somewhere!"

"I ignored the bad reviews and watched anyways. This film had a lot to live up to after Civil War was released and I went into this film expecting the worst. It ended up to be the best Superhero film of 2016 to me. One complaint was that this film was more concerned about universe building than telling a great story than Civil War but for me it was the other way around; Civil War felt like a build up to something else and to be honest, I felt that way when I saw the other MCU films. Batman vs Superman however not only had a great story, but it also felt a lot more consistent than Civil War. This film was way more diverse with the cast than the MCU but unlike the MCU, I felt like this film doesn't go overboard with the SJW stuff like the MCU films or The Star Wars Sequel films do. The Visuals were AMAZING, The Score by Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL was AMAZING as well, The Tone is just right as I actually felt for the characters emotionally, The Cinematography kept my eyes glued to the screen, and the script felt really Intelligent and Complex and despite people calling the writing confusing, I was able to piece it together with no problem whatsoever. This film is similar to Empire Strikes back in terms of popularity so over time after the other movies are released, this movie would probably be more popular.This film was way better than I Expected and deserves another chance.

"Its shame to see what critics and marvel fans did to this movie and targeted Zack Snyder for it. I have seen this movie more than 25 times till date. And i enjoy this movie as much as i enjoyed the first time. The fans who have read DC comics, wouldn't be disappointed in this movie. Its dark movie, yes it is. Because the title shows the intense situation at hand. Two superheroes about to rip each other apart for whatever reasons that brought them to this stage. Yes it had to be dark and intense.Only marvel can be stupid enough to show an alien invasion where humans are loosing the battle and the super heroes are cracking jokes while battles as if they are playing ping pong. a person playing Call of Duty game is more serious while playing than the marvel heroes fighting aliens."

"Last week some news came out from somebody online who had claimed to have seen a finished version of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. If you were like me, you've been leery of checking it out because you weren't sure how much might actually be true. Now Zack Snyder has spoken out about the spoiler-filled post, although his response doesn't really clear anything up.In a word, to MTV, he called the post \"hilarious,which might imply that he's saying that it's mostly, if not entirely, untrue. That might be the case, but then again he could have just said it was untrue and he didn't say that. What he did say, however, is that he doesn't like spoilers. While this may seem odd for the director who's most recent trailer appeared to give away the entire movie, Snyder says that's not the case. Even if you've seen the trailer, you can rest easy, as there is much more we have not seen in then finished film. Says Snyder I have the benefit of seeing the movie. It's cool that think it's too much, and I appreciate people not wanting to know, but there's plenty that they don't know. There's a lot of movie that's not in the trailer. In the process of calling the Batman v Superman Reddit review hilarious, Snyder goes on to talk about how he hates it when spoilers come out. The director would much rather that fans see the movie mostly blind. While he understands that some fans may wish to find the answers before hand, he wants his movies to be mysteries going in. If you're, as an audience member, exploring these articles, looking for answers to questions that you have, maybe you're okay with knowing before you go. It's like an individual taste. But like I said, I want people to see the movie without knowing.Spoilers are a topic that mean different things to different people. While most try to avoid them to some degree, the need to solve the mystery is a nearly universal human experience. We have an inclination to want to know the truth, even while also wanting to be surprised. For most of us getting some information is good, but getting all the information is bad, of course, only getting the details that you want can be difficult."
"The theatrical is choppy, poorly edited, hard to follow, with some really good moments mixed in their. The extended is much more fluent and is much easier to follow, it does have a long runtime, which might make it seem a bit dragging on, but if you like long films done right, like Lord of the Rings, you will like this movie as long as you get into the characters and story. Speaking of which, the story starts out perfectly showing Bruce Wayne as a character, and it is very powerful. There are several moments in this movie that are powerful, emotional, and shocking. Characters. Batman is my favorite fictional character of all time, and believe me when I say, Ben Affleck as Batman was perfect, he had the charisma, the anger, and the look of being through some bad stuff Gal Gadot also does perfect as Wonder Woman, but if you want to really see how good she does, go watch the Wonder Woman movie. Henry Call as Superman. I really don't like it when people say Christopher Reeves is better. Don't get me wrong, Reeves does great, but can you imagine him as Superman in this movie? I wouldn't like it. It would be like Adam West playing Batman in The Dark Knight. Henry Cavill does great in this role, I can say everything about him as I said with Ben Affleck. Jesse Eisenberg as Luthor. I thought it was different in a good way. I've heard a criticism for him as being too much like Joker, but is that a bad thing? Joker is my favorite villain, so to see Superman have an enemy that crazy, but still hold the values Luthor needs to be Luthor, I think it is great. The thing I thought this movie was lacking in the first and second acts was humor, at least good humor. If there was more humor, I would've given this movie a ten because it would give a more relaxing feel to the parts that needed it. All in all though, this movie was awesome, it had powerful moments, it was badass, and just plain fun. It had a great story arc and does its job very well."

"*I will be talking about the Ultimate Edition of the film* This was one of the most anticipated CBM of all time. Ever since the arrival and subsequent success of Marvel's The Avengers people have wondered when will DC launch its own cinematic universe, one of the main reasons being the opportunity to finally see titans such as Batman and Superman share the screen together: the ultimate nerd dream. On 2016, the moment finally came for BvS to be released AND.. it performed poorly. Not only did critical reception left a lot to be desired, but fan reactions where surprisingly split after its cinematic debut. People either loved it and called Zack a genius, or hated it and called him a hack. Me, personally, I found myself with middle of the road feelings, for sure, but more leaning towards the negative side with subsequent viewings. The theatrical cut of the film showcased amazing performances, incredible visuals, and action set pieces that seemed like comic book panels come to life, in a good way. However, when it comes to its narrative structure and more technical aspects like editing, the film was seriously flawed. More plot holes than Age of Ultron, questionable character decisions, random editing that lacked cohesion and focus, and forced dramatic moments that lacked any impact because the attempts at character development ranged from limited to nonexistent, especially when it comes to Superman's character. I thought it was a 5/10 movie at best. As such, I was kind of skeptical about the idea of a 30 minute longer version. I say kind of because I know how Zack works. I remember Watchmen being vastly improved with its director's cut, so in a way I was expecting BvS to perform in a similar manner, but I also feared those 30 minutes wold be just there to amplify action and discredit storytelling issues. Oh boy, I'm so glad I was proved wrong. The ultimate cut of the film was infuriating, but not because it was awful, but because it questions the sanity of WB executives and editors and makes you wonder what were they thinking during the editing process. What I got out of the Ultimate Edition was a thought-provoking deconstruction of two very iconic superheroes that gave spotlight to the struggles both of them face when they aren't fighting crime. What I got was an extremely well produced character study on both Batman and Superman in a cynical world, a world dangerously close to our own. We meet Batman as a ruthless, worn out hero that has seen the failure behind his ideals and witnessed some truly horrifying things in his life. Superman, on the other hand, is portrayed as a godlike figure that seeks to do good in the world, but finds himself emotionally conflicted once he realized that every good deed he does leaves behind a trail of destruction (most of it due to Luthor's antics). In my opinion, this is a hugely original approach, one that distances itself from the rest of the competition and delivers a dark, somber, yet relevant superhero movie that understands both characters and gives them real human struggles to deal with. I felt invested in both of them, and hoped that by the end of the film both could find a way to redeem themselves. Their character arcs were very well established during the first two acts of the movie, and by the time we get to the titular climactic battle the emotion behind the jaw-dropping action is intensified. Lex Luthor as a villain was also given more time to develop with this new edition. One of the main criticisms with the original version was the fact that his plan relied too much on conveniences, and the character's mannerisms and mad-scientist attitude was annoying, and that goes without saying his motivations were unclear. Not only do we spend more time understanding his hate for any godlike figure and thus his hatred for Superman, but the added scenes allowed us to witness his entire plan come to fruition. It sells the cold, manipulative, calculating attributes of his comic counterpart. The acting is spot on. Every actor owns his/her role, from Cavill's Superman, to Ben Affleck as Batman, Eisenberg as Luthor, and Gadot as Wonder Woman, whose scenes are brief, but are more than enough to sell the strong and ferocious warrior that she is. Cinematography is stunning, and miles above that of Man of Steel's. And the soundtrack by Zimmer and Junkie XL? Perfect, just perfect. When it comes to flaws, the film still has some of those. The Martha moment, while serving as a pivotal character moment for Batman, felt off in execution, and its understandable that many people got mad at it. If your main complaint about BvS the first time around was its bleak tone and subject matter, this film is still not for you. I understand most were expecting to see the heroes being the most iconic versions of themselves, clashing in an elongated battle and evoking the same feelings The Avengers gave audiences back in 2012. In that sense, the film will remain divisive, but at least I have the comfort of saying that, at the very least, the film is competently made."

"This film was amazing. Ben Affleck was easily the best part of this movie, he brought his a-game as Batman. The chemistry between Affleck & Irons was outstanding. Gal Gadot did a great job as Wonder Woman. The fight between Batman & Superman was awesome. The final fight with Doomsday was outstanding in every way possible. However, there is only one problem with this film and that's Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor. He was sadly missed cast in this role, but then again it's really the fault of Warner Bros. Studios. Overall, this film deliver on almost every level. I highly recommend that you watch the extended version of this film."

"I know I know. I saw it in theaters too, and felt like it could've been so much better. While the Batman element was good, the narrative felt fractured, and the third act was just one long stunt scene. Superman was relegated to a supporting character, and other characters didn't get a chance to shine. And then I chanced on the ultimate cut. Calling it 30 mins of \"extra\" footage is unfair to Zack Snyder because it's exactly these 30 mins that makes the movie a worthy one. What I can say about the theatrical cut is this - It had the blockbuster elements - music, visuals, stunts, CGI. But, it lacked the human elements. The first 20 mins of the movie had it, but not after that. The extended cut in comparison has a flow to the narrative. There are no disjointed scenes, everything flows smoothly, and there's connective tissue. Superman gets to spend some time with his father, and mother. Clark Kent does some investigative journalism. Superman helps the people after the blast. Lois Lane doesn't jump to conclusions, she gets to the bottom of the crime. Lex Luthor apparently had a coherent plan - everything is explained pretty well. Wonder Woman was already good, so there's no change there :) Also, the \"Martha\" scene seems better executed, because it is a few seconds longer, and there's time to breathe it in. So, here's my take on this movie - The theatrical cut was junk. Get the Bluray for ultimate edition, and you shall not be disappointed. I've seen it so many more times now, and it's the definitive cut. It is the movie we deserve. It's a unique take on Batman, and Superman. It's a gritty take on the superhero movie genre, and definitely the best DCEU movie, and the best DC movie since The Dark Knight.P.S. Yes it's dark. We're adults, and we should appreciate mature film making without intentionally silly moments. It attempts to be philosophical, and something deep instead of just trying to make you chuckle."

"This is one of the best superhero movies ever made. Zack Snyder is a magician behind the camera.The reason behind so many complaints is the fact that Warner Bros. marketed this movie as a fight between Batman and Superman. That's not what it is. It's a movie about the origins of the Justice League.The cinematography, the acting and the score are all second to none. This film is phenomenal.P.S: watch the 3 hour extended cut that Snyder intended you to see, not the 2 and a half hour movie that Warner Bros. decided would be better for theaters."

"I don't care what the critics say, this is a very well-done movie. I'll start my review by listing what I like about the movie.1.) Ben Affleck is the best batman to me and it is not close. He pulls off the role of an aging batman extremely well. Also, Zack Snyder's vision of batman is legit. I have always hated batman up until this adaptation of him. Instead of being a conflicted and idealistic batman, this batman is dark, gritty, and 100% a badass. His equipment is decked out with machine guns and he has no aversion to killing people. In fact, he probably kills about 50 criminal by the time this movie is over. The warehouse scene is the coolest batman scene in any movie.2.) The development of a grudge between batman and superman is pulled off flawlessly. It actually makes sense why batman dislikes superman. Then, when they do fight it is about the coolest thing you can expect to see from a superhero film. 3.) I disagree with a lot of people about Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor. In my opinion, he played his role to perfection. 4.) B v S sets up Wonder Woman and Justice League with Gal Gadot's cameo as Wonder Woman and short clips of Aquaman, the Flash, and Cyborg. B v S is one of my favorite superhero films and rewatching it never gets old."

"The theatrical cut of this film is garbage which is why I rated it eight stars instead of nine. The first time I watched this film I didn't like it (not straight out hate but didn't like). Character motivations didn't make any sense, Lex was annoying as s***, editing was sloppy, and it was overly dark and broody for an action superhero movie. A year + a half, five Marvel films, a ton of bad reviews and a Justice League later a thought popped into my head: \"what if I watched BVS again\". This time I didn't have trailers ruining the best moments, I only vaguely remembered the film, and I was conditioned to look at it negatively but something unexpected happened: I actually loved it. Superman was just a normal person that tried to make a difference cause he could that others imposed their own beliefs on. Lex Luthor was a genius that couldn't stand his powerlessness compared to Superman or more accurately a super being. As Alfred said \"The fever, the rage, the feeling of powerlessness that turns good men... cruel\" and you see the same thought process in Batman. Batman, just like Lex Luthor feels powerless in the midst of a god-being and just like Lex he attempts to destroy him so he can get his sense of power back but unlike Lex, Batman learns something. I what is one of the corniest lines of the movie Superman says, \"Martha\" when he knows he can't win against Batman in a late desperate attempt to save his mother. Not only does this name connect with Bruce Wayne but it also shows what really matters to a man of steel: it isn't power, it isn't fame or anything else, it is his Mother and on a broader scale it is people. Lex (who doesn't care about people at all) knows he doesn't have the power so he creates something from his blood and the remains of Zod: A Doomsday for Superman. Not only does this film have depth but it also doesn't always explain it to you which is rare in a blockbuster action superhero flick normally cater to semi-comic book fans and people that want to shove popcorn in their mouths. This film rewards you for really noticing the details while still having massive explosions. One of my favorites is how Lex has all of Batman's branded killed which is why he isn't afraid of the branding at the end or Grandma's Peach Tea as a way of scaring the s*** out of someone. Of course, this film isn't perfect and I do have personal dislikes. The Batman V Superman fight was slow and pretty boring especially after watching such an amazing fight in Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 2 (If you haven't watched the animated Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 1 and 2 you are sorely missing out on something fantastic). Also, the addition of Wonder Woman who pretty much steals a hacker thing, gives it back and then suits up and fights against a giant monster thing. Not to say I don't like Wonder Woman (She is one of my favorite Superheroes of all time who showed not only can woman kick a** but they also don't need to be ashamed of their sexuality or gender) but she wasn't really that helpful to the plot and just brought in to expand the universe which was well done through Lex's superhuman hunting files. Also, the post-apocalyptic scene that was just a dream could have been cut but nothing is perfect except movies like Citizen Kane which isn't a lot of fun to watch cause it is too perfect. So to summarize, the theatrical cut is bad, the ultimate cut is Amazing and the other cut is meh. Please give it a second chance because it deserves it and save a good director from losing grace because of something he didn't do."
"I really liked it, don't know what all the hate is about. I'm actually a Marvel fan from when I was 7 or so, but Superman and Batman together in 1 movie? Just great. And personally I like Ben Affleck even better than Christian Bale as Batman. So just watch and enjoy, I know I did!"

"That's right. We have been waiting for these two heroes to finally meet and fight against each other. This movie is so good in both plot and special effects.Henry Cavill and Ben Affleck have performed well in their acting stages. They are the best superhero actors and they have filmed their fighting scenes very well. The movie starts to show the conflict between the lives of the heroes and now they have blamed each other for it. This movie is amazing and sets up a good plot for Dawn Justice."

"Actually...I didn't know what to expect. When you see Wonder Woman, you know it will be off of Wonder Woman and off of a Wonder Woman story, but with Batman V Superman, I was like, \"hmmmm, so who is this about?\" It was pretty obvious that it would feature many characters, but I thought the introduction to Batman was amazing. Ben Affleck nailed the part, not only as Batman but also as Bruce Wayne. He is my Batman. Henry Cavill continued to be super as the Man of Steel. And he is my Super - Man. A dark story? Yes, without a doubt. Could it have had a few more jokes? Sure. But not all movies or stories need to have jokes when certain events are serious. I really hope people can see this review and take another look at the movie, because, I loved it. I really hope the ratings can go up, eventually. And P.S, this movie is the perfect set up to Justice League."

"I'll start by making it clear I have only ever seen the Ultimate Edition. I'm aware of what was cut out for the theatrical release, so I will concede up front that most of the criticisms about pacing, editing, and missing bits of plot at release were merited.With that caveat out of the way, I must reiterate that this was bar-none the boldest superhero movie I have ever seen. To me, it was arguably the best as well, though \"best\" shouldn't be taken to mean \"most enjoyable.\" That honor easily goes to \"Thor: Ragnarok.\" What makes BvS stand out among other films in the genre is that it takes two characters who have been done to death since the 1970s and brings them up to date. I recently tried to watch \"Superman: The Movie\" for the first time in a number of years, and while it was still good and Reeves will always be iconic, I just couldn't take it seriously. I'll put it this way: If the story in BvS was \"stupid\" in your view but Superman turning back time by spinning the earth backward on its axis didn't seem like one of the dumbest things you have ever seen -in any movie from any genre- to the extent that it outright ruins the movie for you, then your opinion about BvS isn't worth much. Nostalgic bias was always going to be a problem for this movie, and the way people reacted to and reviewed \"Man of Steel\" was telling in this regard.That brings me to Zack Snyder's take on Superman. You know, that guy whose status as the first extraterrestrial ever encountered by humanity was a total non-issue in the old movies. Apparently, Snyder has a similar view to my own in that his take on the Man of Steel makes his being an alien a core piece of his identity. He may look like any other (absurdly attractive) person, but he knows what he is, and that makes him perpetually uncertain of where he fits in this world. He is essentially good and really does care about people, but he struggles to truly empathize with the likes of us. To be human is to be frail, and that is not something he can easily relate to. This is the root of his conflict with Batman.Just as Clark struggles to genuinely relate to most people, Snyder's Batman either refuses to or otherwise just can't relate to Superman. He doesn't see him as anything but a threat regardless of Superman's clear good intentions. Remember, a small group of Kryptonians were able to bring humanity to the brink of extinction in less than a day, and Bruce Wayne is nothing if not a realist. He didn't know the guy from Kansas. He only knew the god from another world.While Batman's anger toward and fear of Superman are readily apparent from the start, Superman's inability to imagine things from Bruce Wayne's perspective only becomes truly apparent during their first real interaction. This reminded me of the animated version of the \"world's finest\" storyline, where Superman judges Batman harshly for using fear tactics and threats of violence (also, actual violence) to get the job done. Superman wasn't willing to consider what it would take for a human man to fight criminals and save innocents, or what that life would do to him over time. Just as Batman didn't see the guy from Kansas, Superman didn't see the man who lives his life trapped in one brutal, unthinkably traumatic moment (this was beautifully conveyed during the film's opening moments), and had spent his whole adult life bearing witness to humanity at its absolute worst.The conflict between these two characters is as old as human history. They want the same things, but they can't understand one another. So they fight. And what a fight it was.Watching a fight between, say, Captain America and Iron Man was, to me, more frustrating than anything because each understood the other's perspective perfectly. The fight between Batman and Superman in BvS was genuinely gut-wrenching, as intended, because they would have understood one another if either had tried. The whole sequence hilighted Batman's tactical prowess and ability to control a situation. Maybe the most badass thing about the fight was that it ended exactly where Batman planned. That brings me to the big elephant in the room named \"Martha.\"I can't recall exactly which YouTuber put it this way, but if you thought the \"save Martha\" exchange was about their mothers having the same name, you had your brain turned off. The brain-on people have explained this to death, but it bears repeating. This was the moment when Superman became humanized to Batman. He was about to die, and his only concern was for his adoptive human mother. He still believed that the man about to take his life would do the right thing. Even with the cowl on, there was no mistaking the look on Batman's face. It was the look of shame, guilt, and sudden uncertainty that says \"What am I doing?\" Turns out even the most brutal, angry version of Bruce Wayne is better than Tony Stark at knowing right from wrong. At knowing that he had gone too far.From there, the third act was a series of truly impressive (albeit mostly CGI) fight sequences, beginning with what I regard as the undisputed champion of Batman fights. Nothing in the Nolan movies (and especially nothing in the Burton movies) even came close. Go ahead, try to convince yourself that Batman and Bane taking turns punching one another in the face until Bane's mask broke was a good fight sequence. No, this was a fight straight out of \"Arkham Knight,\" and it was glorious. The battle against Doomsday really was one for the books. From the moment Wonder Woman arrived accompanied by the intense sounds of Tina Guo's electric cello to Superman's tragic, heroic death at the hands of Doomsday, I was glued to the screen. Sure, the mere presence of Doomsday spoiled the end to a degree, but watching the Man of Steel laboring to carry that kryptonite spear towards certain death was no less impactful. A brief word on Jesse Eisenberg's take on Lex Luthor. At least one other reviewer on this site already said it best when they pointed out that this was his origin story. If you consider his scheme objectively, he is actually one of the more formidable incarnations of the character. If we're lucky, we'll eventually get to see a Snyder Cut of \"Justice League\" and find out where this story was actually meant to go. For the record, Joss Whedon and Danny Elfman both should have said \"no\" to taking a dump on someone else's art."
"BATMAN V SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE brings a fantastic surprise to a smash-hit team-up with one of the worlds most beloved DC Comics' icons of all time. The movie delivers spectacular casting, and fantastic acting with different characters having their shine in each scenes.The story follows Clark Kent/Superman who becomes a threat, after the destruction in Metropolis in Man Of Steel.(2013). Batman/Bruce Wayne sees him as a threat and begins his war on Superman.The movie brings spectacular storytelling, it tells the complications of human against alien who are on the same side, and the first meeting of Batman and Superman. The story of Bruce Wayne, with his many years of The Caped Crusader, sends him on a spiral of \"out of control\", sheer anger, and builds tension to wanting to defeat the Man of Steel. Snyder has fantastically gave this storytelling an exciting nod to the comics.Lex Luthor, played by Jesse Einsberg, delivers a very interesting performance, but very differently by him showing is his \"origin\" before he becomes a bald foe to the Man of Steel. He shows that his love of \"god vs man\" terrorises mankind when he ultimately creates Doomsday, and Batman realises Superman's inner heroism.It packs so many great \"out of nowhere\" excitement, including a first-look of the fearful Wonder Woman a.k.a. Diana Prince, played by Gal Gadot, and a fresh-new glimpse of the superhero DC canon: The Justice League.WATCH THIS MOVIE! The critics are out of their mind. It's a fun-packed action adventure which still keeps the movie enjoyable until it's final minutes of the movie. It's a FANTASTIC MOVIE! BEN AFFLECK AS BATMAN... is Incredible!A 10/10 overall!"
"I want to go on record as saying that this is a truly thrilling cinematic experience in so many ways. If pressed, I guess I could acknowledge that there were a couple ... let's say \"clumsy\" moments. And in a film that runs to three hours, that hardly seems like a significant issue, certainly not enough to rate it with fewer than 9 stars.This film has everything. There is dramatic tension right from the start. There is a magnificent story arc that picks up quite seamlessly from 'Man of Steel' and propels the viewer not only into the life of Clark Kent/Superman but also of Bruce Wayne/Batman.The villain is no mere cartoon of a villain; he is truly thoroughly (and apparently irrevocably) diabolical. He is a psychopath, and you wish for his death over and over and over. You want Superman to reduce him to ash with the power of his eyes.I have read a number of viewers' reviews, and it seems that the people who disliked the film / gave it a low rating had rather unfair and unrealistic expectations of it. That is, their own prejudices about how the plot could/should unfold or what the character development could/should be, etc. ruined the film for them. And that is a shame.My thought is: I settle into my seat, wait for the lights to dim, and then I wait to be transported by the film. I accept it, lock, stock, and barrel.As another reviewer remarked, I love how the film begins from the point of view of Bruce Wayne as he is among people on the ground who have fallen victim to the attack of Zod and the other Kryptonians.Why would Bruce Wayne not like Superman? Why would the good people of Earth hurl insults at Superman and burn him in effigy (on the news)? Because the good people of Earth just got catapulted into a new reality in which there are not only extraterrestrial beings (surprise!) but they are also superman! And a group of them are hell-bent on destroying humankind and taking the planet for themselves.It is difficult to see Superman as separate from the whole Kryptonian Krew.It seems that many moviegoers forgot that Bruce Wayne is also human. Sure, he's a hero, but he is flawed.. Just like the rest of us. He is a vigilante, after all.He has let his vigilantism get the better of him. HE is actually the one working outside the boundaries of the law, not Superman. It is the clear head of Alfred that shows us that he has gone into a rather dark place, that he has not seen what is really going on (in Luthor's scheme), and so he chooses to embark on his own scheme scheme to take out the alien invader. He is (allegedly) thinking of the future: if he wipes out the all-powerful alien, then it can't turn on humankind in the future. At least, he convinces himself of that.A philosophical question is raised in the film: should Clark Kent have remained a simple man from Kansas and never have become the Superman? Should he just let people die and let calamities happen? The question is answered for us in the character of Diana Prince/Wonder Woman. She withdrew from mankind (her exact words) and just sat around watching. Watching while people died horrible deaths all around her. So, should Superman have done the same? Do these special beings, these 'metahumans', have some kind of moral imperative to intervene, or should they be allowed to be regular people, too? It seems that humans want it both ways.It seems that humans are saying: \"Don't be a superalien ... except when I and my friends and family are in trouble. Then come save us.\""

"Batman v Superman: Ultimate Edition: If your looking for a quick, cheap thrill then you might not enjoy this film at the time. This movies theatrical version was butchered by WB and in doing so reshaped the story leaving numerous plot holes. So the Ultimate Edition is the full story and the one worth seeing. Watch 'Man of Steel' before seeing this movie. There is much to claw through here, so much so that the audience might easily find themselves exhausted from the overall aggression of the film. However, a lot of the story does work. The action is good, and the emotion feels real most of the time.This film is about Superman trying to become Superman. Trying to help the world, save people, find a place in this world not as an outcast, and yet is looked at has a threat by many. Superman is not from this world, yet He is trying to be human, find a place in this world, be excepted by earths people, and come into his destiny.This film is also about Batman being Batman for 20 years and losing faith in humanity, and fearing Superman, what Superman can do with his powers. Great film, great plot, great visuals. ---Yidioo"
"I didn't see the film in the theaters and just bought the \"Extended Edition \" on Amazon. I never properly saw Man of Steel- i think I rented it and watched it when already exhausted and fell asleep. I saw the mediocre user reviews and horrible reviews from critics of this film.They really have it wrong. This is the very best either Batman or Superman. It has a different take, on things. Much darker then earlier films even darker then the Christopher Nolan Batman films.First of all Christopher Nolan is an Executive Producer. So how bad could it be? I loved Sucker Punch and Zack Snyder was involved with that. So how bad could this be? Hans Zimmer did the music, so how bad could it be?I remember watching the old Superman TV shows and reading the Superman and Batman comics as a little kid and loved them, but i wouldn't call myself a \"fan boy\" of comic universes, like so many younger people today. As an older adult I will admit my favorite TV show of all time was Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but watched it on DVD only after it had finished. I saw the second of the Dark Knight series in the theater, but the other two, I watched on DVD. They were great, but not my favorite films like so many people. i also loved the first couple Superman and Batman films in the older series. Regardless, i was not waiting with baited breath to see Man of Steel or this one.I'm more of a serious film fan, who can watch Stanley Kubrick films over and over and my favorite films in the last twenty years, are Eyes Wide Shut and Intersteller, both of which i've watched multiple times.So, with that said, take it from me, the critics have this film very wrong, just as critics hated 2001: A Space Odyssey when it first came out. This film will have lasting appreciation.Surprised how much I liked Ben Afleck's Batman. it was hard to get into Henry Cavil's scrawnier looking Superman, but it grew on me. Amy Adams was great as Lois Lane, The Gal Gadol Wonder Women was amazing. Lex Luther was terrific, like Nolan's Joker. Jeremy Irons was the best Alfred ever. Holly Hunter and Diane Lane was good too. The movie had bad reviews but made a billion dollars. Hopefully everyone buys the Ultimate Edition and it breaks sales records and the film is re-appreciated. I have no idea what scenes this Ultimate Edition added, but it is pretty perfect. Now I can't wait for Wonder Woman and the Justice League and as soon as I finish writing this am going to watch Man of Steal. I'm into it now!I can only surmise that the bad reviews stem from too much expectations of the rigid fan boy types and the radical changes in tone, we see in this film.Total masterpiece of cinema, but I have a few criticisms. There are a few hollow scenes of typical Idiot cops and authorities getting everything wrong in a cliché type way and it has a few filler scenes of that type and a few moments here and there that felt rushed and cheesy. Maybe not everything restored into the Ultimate Edition should have been. I wish there had been more Kevin Costner scenes."

"The whole entire Batman V Superman movie was great and yes even though it felt slow to the majority of the people who watched it but to me I enjoyed every part and every scene of Batman V Superman and when it got to the fight scenes both batman VS Superman and the Doomsday fight it brought so much drama, intensity, and epic performances. So with that being said I give this movie a good 10/10 because it really did go to my expectations and it brought a powerful performance and a powerful yet epic introduction to the upcoming Justice League."

"When I first wrote a review for this movie a year ago exclaiming my excitement for the film, I had been high off a fresh dose of live-action DC superheroes playing out the beloved comic book stories that I had grown up on. It was all playing out before my eyes and coming to life. After a few months had passed, I began to notice things about the movie that I disliked: little gaps in the story, things that didn't add up, etc. My original rating of a 10 / 10 dropped to an 8 /10. But today it has gone back up to a 10. The extended version of the film not only rectifies the gaps but also silences critics.Many claimed that the movie was too dark or that it just didn't make sense. To those people, I say: \"Pick up a comic book!\" Many of the critics of this particular film were part of the superhero bandwagon that formed when Marvel began its spree of Avengers-related films. In fact, its estimated that over 60% of people who go to see 'superhero' genre films have never picked up a comic book in their life. I would argue that similar numbers could figure to those which view the CW televised DC Universe shows. People complain that DC comics is just too dark but the fact is that these movies are based upon actual comics which are meant to be dark (ex: The Dark Knight Returns, Injustice, etc.). Its like complaining that Game of Thrones (the TV series) sucks because they kill off too many characters. Read the books! Its frustrating to see such a beautiful work of art like Batman V Superman criticized by those ignorant to its universe and its meaning. This movie is in fact a catalyst that opens numerous doorways and leaves true fans in awe of the possibilities for future movies. But regardless of whether or not people choose to educate themselves, this film's DVD/Blu-ray extended version puts the theater release to shame. All of the plot holes and gaps are filled in 30 minutes of extended footage scattered throughout the film. The movie ultimately becomes more complete and people will wish that the movie had shown the full 3 hours of footage in its theatrical debut. As a major DC comics fan, I will of course pick up on things that a comics fan would not, but someone who does not read comics would learn to appreciate this film in its entirety with the extended version. Get your hands on a copy today or find it on Netflix or the internet somewhere!"

"I ignored the bad reviews and watched anyways. This film had a lot to live up to after Civil War was released and I went into this film expecting the worst. It ended up to be the best Superhero film of 2016 to me. One complaint was that this film was more concerned about universe building than telling a great story than Civil War but for me it was the other way around; Civil War felt like a build up to something else and to be honest, I felt that way when I saw the other MCU films. Batman vs Superman however not only had a great story, but it also felt a lot more consistent than Civil War. This film was way more diverse with the cast than the MCU but unlike the MCU, I felt like this film doesn't go overboard with the SJW stuff like the MCU films or The Star Wars Sequel films do. The Visuals were AMAZING, The Score by Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL was AMAZING as well, The Tone is just right as I actually felt for the characters emotionally, The Cinematography kept my eyes glued to the screen, and the script felt really Intelligent and Complex and despite people calling the writing confusing, I was able to piece it together with no problem whatsoever. This film is similar to Empire Strikes back in terms of popularity so over time after the other movies are released, this movie would probably be more popular.This film was way better than I Expected and deserves another chance.

"Its shame to see what critics and marvel fans did to this movie and targeted Zack Snyder for it. I have seen this movie more than 25 times till date. And i enjoy this movie as much as i enjoyed the first time. The fans who have read DC comics, wouldn't be disappointed in this movie. Its dark movie, yes it is. Because the title shows the intense situation at hand. Two superheroes about to rip each other apart for whatever reasons that brought them to this stage. Yes it had to be dark and intense.Only marvel can be stupid enough to show an alien invasion where humans are loosing the battle and the super heroes are cracking jokes while battles as if they are playing ping pong. a person playing Call of Duty game is more serious while playing than the marvel heroes fighting aliens."

"Last week some news came out from somebody online who had claimed to have seen a finished version of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. If you were like me, you've been leery of checking it out because you weren't sure how much might actually be true. Now Zack Snyder has spoken out about the spoiler-filled post, although his response doesn't really clear anything up.In a word, to MTV, he called the post \"hilarious,which might imply that he's saying that it's mostly, if not entirely, untrue. That might be the case, but then again he could have just said it was untrue and he didn't say that. What he did say, however, is that he doesn't like spoilers. While this may seem odd for the director who's most recent trailer appeared to give away the entire movie, Snyder says that's not the case. Even if you've seen the trailer, you can rest easy, as there is much more we have not seen in then finished film. Says Snyder I have the benefit of seeing the movie. It's cool that think it's too much, and I appreciate people not wanting to know, but there's plenty that they don't know. There's a lot of movie that's not in the trailer. In the process of calling the Batman v Superman Reddit review hilarious, Snyder goes on to talk about how he hates it when spoilers come out. The director would much rather that fans see the movie mostly blind. While he understands that some fans may wish to find the answers before hand, he wants his movies to be mysteries going in. If you're, as an audience member, exploring these articles, looking for answers to questions that you have, maybe you're okay with knowing before you go. It's like an individual taste. But like I said, I want people to see the movie without knowing.Spoilers are a topic that mean different things to different people. While most try to avoid them to some degree, the need to solve the mystery is a nearly universal human experience. We have an inclination to want to know the truth, even while also wanting to be surprised. For most of us getting some information is good, but getting all the information is bad, of course, only getting the details that you want can be difficult."
"The theatrical is choppy, poorly edited, hard to follow, with some really good moments mixed in their. The extended is much more fluent and is much easier to follow, it does have a long runtime, which might make it seem a bit dragging on, but if you like long films done right, like Lord of the Rings, you will like this movie as long as you get into the characters and story. Speaking of which, the story starts out perfectly showing Bruce Wayne as a character, and it is very powerful. There are several moments in this movie that are powerful, emotional, and shocking. Characters. Batman is my favorite fictional character of all time, and believe me when I say, Ben Affleck as Batman was perfect, he had the charisma, the anger, and the look of being through some bad stuff Gal Gadot also does perfect as Wonder Woman, but if you want to really see how good she does, go watch the Wonder Woman movie. Henry Call as Superman. I really don't like it when people say Christopher Reeves is better. Don't get me wrong, Reeves does great, but can you imagine him as Superman in this movie? I wouldn't like it. It would be like Adam West playing Batman in The Dark Knight. Henry Cavill does great in this role, I can say everything about him as I said with Ben Affleck. Jesse Eisenberg as Luthor. I thought it was different in a good way. I've heard a criticism for him as being too much like Joker, but is that a bad thing? Joker is my favorite villain, so to see Superman have an enemy that crazy, but still hold the values Luthor needs to be Luthor, I think it is great. The thing I thought this movie was lacking in the first and second acts was humor, at least good humor. If there was more humor, I would've given this movie a ten because it would give a more relaxing feel to the parts that needed it. All in all though, this movie was awesome, it had powerful moments, it was badass, and just plain fun. It had a great story arc and does its job very well."

"*I will be talking about the Ultimate Edition of the film* This was one of the most anticipated CBM of all time. Ever since the arrival and subsequent success of Marvel's The Avengers people have wondered when will DC launch its own cinematic universe, one of the main reasons being the opportunity to finally see titans such as Batman and Superman share the screen together: the ultimate nerd dream. On 2016, the moment finally came for BvS to be released AND.. it performed poorly. Not only did critical reception left a lot to be desired, but fan reactions where surprisingly split after its cinematic debut. People either loved it and called Zack a genius, or hated it and called him a hack. Me, personally, I found myself with middle of the road feelings, for sure, but more leaning towards the negative side with subsequent viewings. The theatrical cut of the film showcased amazing performances, incredible visuals, and action set pieces that seemed like comic book panels come to life, in a good way. However, when it comes to its narrative structure and more technical aspects like editing, the film was seriously flawed. More plot holes than Age of Ultron, questionable character decisions, random editing that lacked cohesion and focus, and forced dramatic moments that lacked any impact because the attempts at character development ranged from limited to nonexistent, especially when it comes to Superman's character. I thought it was a 5/10 movie at best. As such, I was kind of skeptical about the idea of a 30 minute longer version. I say kind of because I know how Zack works. I remember Watchmen being vastly improved with its director's cut, so in a way I was expecting BvS to perform in a similar manner, but I also feared those 30 minutes wold be just there to amplify action and discredit storytelling issues. Oh boy, I'm so glad I was proved wrong. The ultimate cut of the film was infuriating, but not because it was awful, but because it questions the sanity of WB executives and editors and makes you wonder what were they thinking during the editing process. What I got out of the Ultimate Edition was a thought-provoking deconstruction of two very iconic superheroes that gave spotlight to the struggles both of them face when they aren't fighting crime. What I got was an extremely well produced character study on both Batman and Superman in a cynical world, a world dangerously close to our own. We meet Batman as a ruthless, worn out hero that has seen the failure behind his ideals and witnessed some truly horrifying things in his life. Superman, on the other hand, is portrayed as a godlike figure that seeks to do good in the world, but finds himself emotionally conflicted once he realized that every good deed he does leaves behind a trail of destruction (most of it due to Luthor's antics). In my opinion, this is a hugely original approach, one that distances itself from the rest of the competition and delivers a dark, somber, yet relevant superhero movie that understands both characters and gives them real human struggles to deal with. I felt invested in both of them, and hoped that by the end of the film both could find a way to redeem themselves. Their character arcs were very well established during the first two acts of the movie, and by the time we get to the titular climactic battle the emotion behind the jaw-dropping action is intensified. Lex Luthor as a villain was also given more time to develop with this new edition. One of the main criticisms with the original version was the fact that his plan relied too much on conveniences, and the character's mannerisms and mad-scientist attitude was annoying, and that goes without saying his motivations were unclear. Not only do we spend more time understanding his hate for any godlike figure and thus his hatred for Superman, but the added scenes allowed us to witness his entire plan come to fruition. It sells the cold, manipulative, calculating attributes of his comic counterpart. The acting is spot on. Every actor owns his/her role, from Cavill's Superman, to Ben Affleck as Batman, Eisenberg as Luthor, and Gadot as Wonder Woman, whose scenes are brief, but are more than enough to sell the strong and ferocious warrior that she is. Cinematography is stunning, and miles above that of Man of Steel's. And the soundtrack by Zimmer and Junkie XL? Perfect, just perfect. When it comes to flaws, the film still has some of those. The Martha moment, while serving as a pivotal character moment for Batman, felt off in execution, and its understandable that many people got mad at it. If your main complaint about BvS the first time around was its bleak tone and subject matter, this film is still not for you. I understand most were expecting to see the heroes being the most iconic versions of themselves, clashing in an elongated battle and evoking the same feelings The Avengers gave audiences back in 2012. In that sense, the film will remain divisive, but at least I have the comfort of saying that, at the very least, the film is competently made."

"This film was amazing. Ben Affleck was easily the best part of this movie, he brought his a-game as Batman. The chemistry between Affleck & Irons was outstanding. Gal Gadot did a great job as Wonder Woman. The fight between Batman & Superman was awesome. The final fight with Doomsday was outstanding in every way possible. However, there is only one problem with this film and that's Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor. He was sadly missed cast in this role, but then again it's really the fault of Warner Bros. Studios. Overall, this film deliver on almost every level. I highly recommend that you watch the extended version of this film."

"I know I know. I saw it in theaters too, and felt like it could've been so much better. While the Batman element was good, the narrative felt fractured, and the third act was just one long stunt scene. Superman was relegated to a supporting character, and other characters didn't get a chance to shine. And then I chanced on the ultimate cut. Calling it 30 mins of \"extra\" footage is unfair to Zack Snyder because it's exactly these 30 mins that makes the movie a worthy one. What I can say about the theatrical cut is this - It had the blockbuster elements - music, visuals, stunts, CGI. But, it lacked the human elements. The first 20 mins of the movie had it, but not after that. The extended cut in comparison has a flow to the narrative. There are no disjointed scenes, everything flows smoothly, and there's connective tissue. Superman gets to spend some time with his father, and mother. Clark Kent does some investigative journalism. Superman helps the people after the blast. Lois Lane doesn't jump to conclusions, she gets to the bottom of the crime. Lex Luthor apparently had a coherent plan - everything is explained pretty well. Wonder Woman was already good, so there's no change there :) Also, the \"Martha\" scene seems better executed, because it is a few seconds longer, and there's time to breathe it in. So, here's my take on this movie - The theatrical cut was junk. Get the Bluray for ultimate edition, and you shall not be disappointed. I've seen it so many more times now, and it's the definitive cut. It is the movie we deserve. It's a unique take on Batman, and Superman. It's a gritty take on the superhero movie genre, and definitely the best DCEU movie, and the best DC movie since The Dark Knight.P.S. Yes it's dark. We're adults, and we should appreciate mature film making without intentionally silly moments. It attempts to be philosophical, and something deep instead of just trying to make you chuckle."

"This is one of the best superhero movies ever made. Zack Snyder is a magician behind the camera.The reason behind so many complaints is the fact that Warner Bros. marketed this movie as a fight between Batman and Superman. That's not what it is. It's a movie about the origins of the Justice League.The cinematography, the acting and the score are all second to none. This film is phenomenal.P.S: watch the 3 hour extended cut that Snyder intended you to see, not the 2 and a half hour movie that Warner Bros. decided would be better for theaters."

"I don't care what the critics say, this is a very well-done movie. I'll start my review by listing what I like about the movie.1.) Ben Affleck is the best batman to me and it is not close. He pulls off the role of an aging batman extremely well. Also, Zack Snyder's vision of batman is legit. I have always hated batman up until this adaptation of him. Instead of being a conflicted and idealistic batman, this batman is dark, gritty, and 100% a badass. His equipment is decked out with machine guns and he has no aversion to killing people. In fact, he probably kills about 50 criminal by the time this movie is over. The warehouse scene is the coolest batman scene in any movie.2.) The development of a grudge between batman and superman is pulled off flawlessly. It actually makes sense why batman dislikes superman. Then, when they do fight it is about the coolest thing you can expect to see from a superhero film. 3.) I disagree with a lot of people about Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor. In my opinion, he played his role to perfection. 4.) B v S sets up Wonder Woman and Justice League with Gal Gadot's cameo as Wonder Woman and short clips of Aquaman, the Flash, and Cyborg. B v S is one of my favorite superhero films and rewatching it never gets old."

"The theatrical cut of this film is garbage which is why I rated it eight stars instead of nine. The first time I watched this film I didn't like it (not straight out hate but didn't like). Character motivations didn't make any sense, Lex was annoying as s***, editing was sloppy, and it was overly dark and broody for an action superhero movie. A year + a half, five Marvel films, a ton of bad reviews and a Justice League later a thought popped into my head: \"what if I watched BVS again\". This time I didn't have trailers ruining the best moments, I only vaguely remembered the film, and I was conditioned to look at it negatively but something unexpected happened: I actually loved it. Superman was just a normal person that tried to make a difference cause he could that others imposed their own beliefs on. Lex Luthor was a genius that couldn't stand his powerlessness compared to Superman or more accurately a super being. As Alfred said \"The fever, the rage, the feeling of powerlessness that turns good men... cruel\" and you see the same thought process in Batman. Batman, just like Lex Luthor feels powerless in the midst of a god-being and just like Lex he attempts to destroy him so he can get his sense of power back but unlike Lex, Batman learns something. I what is one of the corniest lines of the movie Superman says, \"Martha\" when he knows he can't win against Batman in a late desperate attempt to save his mother. Not only does this name connect with Bruce Wayne but it also shows what really matters to a man of steel: it isn't power, it isn't fame or anything else, it is his Mother and on a broader scale it is people. Lex (who doesn't care about people at all) knows he doesn't have the power so he creates something from his blood and the remains of Zod: A Doomsday for Superman. Not only does this film have depth but it also doesn't always explain it to you which is rare in a blockbuster action superhero flick normally cater to semi-comic book fans and people that want to shove popcorn in their mouths. This film rewards you for really noticing the details while still having massive explosions. One of my favorites is how Lex has all of Batman's branded killed which is why he isn't afraid of the branding at the end or Grandma's Peach Tea as a way of scaring the s*** out of someone. Of course, this film isn't perfect and I do have personal dislikes. The Batman V Superman fight was slow and pretty boring especially after watching such an amazing fight in Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 2 (If you haven't watched the animated Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 1 and 2 you are sorely missing out on something fantastic). Also, the addition of Wonder Woman who pretty much steals a hacker thing, gives it back and then suits up and fights against a giant monster thing. Not to say I don't like Wonder Woman (She is one of my favorite Superheroes of all time who showed not only can woman kick a** but they also don't need to be ashamed of their sexuality or gender) but she wasn't really that helpful to the plot and just brought in to expand the universe which was well done through Lex's superhuman hunting files. Also, the post-apocalyptic scene that was just a dream could have been cut but nothing is perfect except movies like Citizen Kane which isn't a lot of fun to watch cause it is too perfect. So to summarize, the theatrical cut is bad, the ultimate cut is Amazing and the other cut is meh. Please give it a second chance because it deserves it and save a good director from losing grace because of something he didn't do."
"I really liked it, don't know what all the hate is about. I'm actually a Marvel fan from when I was 7 or so, but Superman and Batman together in 1 movie? Just great. And personally I like Ben Affleck even better than Christian Bale as Batman. So just watch and enjoy, I know I did!"

"That's right. We have been waiting for these two heroes to finally meet and fight against each other. This movie is so good in both plot and special effects.Henry Cavill and Ben Affleck have performed well in their acting stages. They are the best superhero actors and they have filmed their fighting scenes very well. The movie starts to show the conflict between the lives of the heroes and now they have blamed each other for it. This movie is amazing and sets up a good plot for Dawn Justice."

"Actually...I didn't know what to expect. When you see Wonder Woman, you know it will be off of Wonder Woman and off of a Wonder Woman story, but with Batman V Superman, I was like, \"hmmmm, so who is this about?\" It was pretty obvious that it would feature many characters, but I thought the introduction to Batman was amazing. Ben Affleck nailed the part, not only as Batman but also as Bruce Wayne. He is my Batman. Henry Cavill continued to be super as the Man of Steel. And he is my Super - Man. A dark story? Yes, without a doubt. Could it have had a few more jokes? Sure. But not all movies or stories need to have jokes when certain events are serious. I really hope people can see this review and take another look at the movie, because, I loved it. I really hope the ratings can go up, eventually. And P.S, this movie is the perfect set up to Justice League."

"I'll start by making it clear I have only ever seen the Ultimate Edition. I'm aware of what was cut out for the theatrical release, so I will concede up front that most of the criticisms about pacing, editing, and missing bits of plot at release were merited.With that caveat out of the way, I must reiterate that this was bar-none the boldest superhero movie I have ever seen. To me, it was arguably the best as well, though \"best\" shouldn't be taken to mean \"most enjoyable.\" That honor easily goes to \"Thor: Ragnarok.\" What makes BvS stand out among other films in the genre is that it takes two characters who have been done to death since the 1970s and brings them up to date. I recently tried to watch \"Superman: The Movie\" for the first time in a number of years, and while it was still good and Reeves will always be iconic, I just couldn't take it seriously. I'll put it this way: If the story in BvS was \"stupid\" in your view but Superman turning back time by spinning the earth backward on its axis didn't seem like one of the dumbest things you have ever seen -in any movie from any genre- to the extent that it outright ruins the movie for you, then your opinion about BvS isn't worth much. Nostalgic bias was always going to be a problem for this movie, and the way people reacted to and reviewed \"Man of Steel\" was telling in this regard.That brings me to Zack Snyder's take on Superman. You know, that guy whose status as the first extraterrestrial ever encountered by humanity was a total non-issue in the old movies. Apparently, Snyder has a similar view to my own in that his take on the Man of Steel makes his being an alien a core piece of his identity. He may look like any other (absurdly attractive) person, but he knows what he is, and that makes him perpetually uncertain of where he fits in this world. He is essentially good and really does care about people, but he struggles to truly empathize with the likes of us. To be human is to be frail, and that is not something he can easily relate to. This is the root of his conflict with Batman.Just as Clark struggles to genuinely relate to most people, Snyder's Batman either refuses to or otherwise just can't relate to Superman. He doesn't see him as anything but a threat regardless of Superman's clear good intentions. Remember, a small group of Kryptonians were able to bring humanity to the brink of extinction in less than a day, and Bruce Wayne is nothing if not a realist. He didn't know the guy from Kansas. He only knew the god from another world.While Batman's anger toward and fear of Superman are readily apparent from the start, Superman's inability to imagine things from Bruce Wayne's perspective only becomes truly apparent during their first real interaction. This reminded me of the animated version of the \"world's finest\" storyline, where Superman judges Batman harshly for using fear tactics and threats of violence (also, actual violence) to get the job done. Superman wasn't willing to consider what it would take for a human man to fight criminals and save innocents, or what that life would do to him over time. Just as Batman didn't see the guy from Kansas, Superman didn't see the man who lives his life trapped in one brutal, unthinkably traumatic moment (this was beautifully conveyed during the film's opening moments), and had spent his whole adult life bearing witness to humanity at its absolute worst.The conflict between these two characters is as old as human history. They want the same things, but they can't understand one another. So they fight. And what a fight it was.Watching a fight between, say, Captain America and Iron Man was, to me, more frustrating than anything because each understood the other's perspective perfectly. The fight between Batman and Superman in BvS was genuinely gut-wrenching, as intended, because they would have understood one another if either had tried. The whole sequence hilighted Batman's tactical prowess and ability to control a situation. Maybe the most badass thing about the fight was that it ended exactly where Batman planned. That brings me to the big elephant in the room named \"Martha.\"I can't recall exactly which YouTuber put it this way, but if you thought the \"save Martha\" exchange was about their mothers having the same name, you had your brain turned off. The brain-on people have explained this to death, but it bears repeating. This was the moment when Superman became humanized to Batman. He was about to die, and his only concern was for his adoptive human mother. He still believed that the man about to take his life would do the right thing. Even with the cowl on, there was no mistaking the look on Batman's face. It was the look of shame, guilt, and sudden uncertainty that says \"What am I doing?\" Turns out even the most brutal, angry version of Bruce Wayne is better than Tony Stark at knowing right from wrong. At knowing that he had gone too far.From there, the third act was a series of truly impressive (albeit mostly CGI) fight sequences, beginning with what I regard as the undisputed champion of Batman fights. Nothing in the Nolan movies (and especially nothing in the Burton movies) even came close. Go ahead, try to convince yourself that Batman and Bane taking turns punching one another in the face until Bane's mask broke was a good fight sequence. No, this was a fight straight out of \"Arkham Knight,\" and it was glorious. The battle against Doomsday really was one for the books. From the moment Wonder Woman arrived accompanied by the intense sounds of Tina Guo's electric cello to Superman's tragic, heroic death at the hands of Doomsday, I was glued to the screen. Sure, the mere presence of Doomsday spoiled the end to a degree, but watching the Man of Steel laboring to carry that kryptonite spear towards certain death was no less impactful. A brief word on Jesse Eisenberg's take on Lex Luthor. At least one other reviewer on this site already said it best when they pointed out that this was his origin story. If you consider his scheme objectively, he is actually one of the more formidable incarnations of the character. If we're lucky, we'll eventually get to see a Snyder Cut of \"Justice League\" and find out where this story was actually meant to go. For the record, Joss Whedon and Danny Elfman both should have said \"no\" to taking a dump on someone else's art."
"BATMAN V SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE brings a fantastic surprise to a smash-hit team-up with one of the worlds most beloved DC Comics' icons of all time. The movie delivers spectacular casting, and fantastic acting with different characters having their shine in each scenes.The story follows Clark Kent/Superman who becomes a threat, after the destruction in Metropolis in Man Of Steel.(2013). Batman/Bruce Wayne sees him as a threat and begins his war on Superman.The movie brings spectacular storytelling, it tells the complications of human against alien who are on the same side, and the first meeting of Batman and Superman. The story of Bruce Wayne, with his many years of The Caped Crusader, sends him on a spiral of \"out of control\", sheer anger, and builds tension to wanting to defeat the Man of Steel. Snyder has fantastically gave this storytelling an exciting nod to the comics.Lex Luthor, played by Jesse Einsberg, delivers a very interesting performance, but very differently by him showing is his \"origin\" before he becomes a bald foe to the Man of Steel. He shows that his love of \"god vs man\" terrorises mankind when he ultimately creates Doomsday, and Batman realises Superman's inner heroism.It packs so many great \"out of nowhere\" excitement, including a first-look of the fearful Wonder Woman a.k.a. Diana Prince, played by Gal Gadot, and a fresh-new glimpse of the superhero DC canon: The Justice League.WATCH THIS MOVIE! The critics are out of their mind. It's a fun-packed action adventure which still keeps the movie enjoyable until it's final minutes of the movie. It's a FANTASTIC MOVIE! BEN AFFLECK AS BATMAN... is Incredible!A 10/10 overall!"
"I want to go on record as saying that this is a truly thrilling cinematic experience in so many ways. If pressed, I guess I could acknowledge that there were a couple ... let's say \"clumsy\" moments. And in a film that runs to three hours, that hardly seems like a significant issue, certainly not enough to rate it with fewer than 9 stars.This film has everything. There is dramatic tension right from the start. There is a magnificent story arc that picks up quite seamlessly from 'Man of Steel' and propels the viewer not only into the life of Clark Kent/Superman but also of Bruce Wayne/Batman.The villain is no mere cartoon of a villain; he is truly thoroughly (and apparently irrevocably) diabolical. He is a psychopath, and you wish for his death over and over and over. You want Superman to reduce him to ash with the power of his eyes.I have read a number of viewers' reviews, and it seems that the people who disliked the film / gave it a low rating had rather unfair and unrealistic expectations of it. That is, their own prejudices about how the plot could/should unfold or what the character development could/should be, etc. ruined the film for them. And that is a shame.My thought is: I settle into my seat, wait for the lights to dim, and then I wait to be transported by the film. I accept it, lock, stock, and barrel.As another reviewer remarked, I love how the film begins from the point of view of Bruce Wayne as he is among people on the ground who have fallen victim to the attack of Zod and the other Kryptonians.Why would Bruce Wayne not like Superman? Why would the good people of Earth hurl insults at Superman and burn him in effigy (on the news)? Because the good people of Earth just got catapulted into a new reality in which there are not only extraterrestrial beings (surprise!) but they are also superman! And a group of them are hell-bent on destroying humankind and taking the planet for themselves.It is difficult to see Superman as separate from the whole Kryptonian Krew.It seems that many moviegoers forgot that Bruce Wayne is also human. Sure, he's a hero, but he is flawed.. Just like the rest of us. He is a vigilante, after all.He has let his vigilantism get the better of him. HE is actually the one working outside the boundaries of the law, not Superman. It is the clear head of Alfred that shows us that he has gone into a rather dark place, that he has not seen what is really going on (in Luthor's scheme), and so he chooses to embark on his own scheme scheme to take out the alien invader. He is (allegedly) thinking of the future: if he wipes out the all-powerful alien, then it can't turn on humankind in the future. At least, he convinces himself of that.A philosophical question is raised in the film: should Clark Kent have remained a simple man from Kansas and never have become the Superman? Should he just let people die and let calamities happen? The question is answered for us in the character of Diana Prince/Wonder Woman. She withdrew from mankind (her exact words) and just sat around watching. Watching while people died horrible deaths all around her. So, should Superman have done the same? Do these special beings, these 'metahumans', have some kind of moral imperative to intervene, or should they be allowed to be regular people, too? It seems that humans want it both ways.It seems that humans are saying: \"Don't be a superalien ... except when I and my friends and family are in trouble. Then come save us.\""

"Batman v Superman: Ultimate Edition: If your looking for a quick, cheap thrill then you might not enjoy this film at the time. This movies theatrical version was butchered by WB and in doing so reshaped the story leaving numerous plot holes. So the Ultimate Edition is the full story and the one worth seeing. Watch 'Man of Steel' before seeing this movie. There is much to claw through here, so much so that the audience might easily find themselves exhausted from the overall aggression of the film. However, a lot of the story does work. The action is good, and the emotion feels real most of the time.This film is about Superman trying to become Superman. Trying to help the world, save people, find a place in this world not as an outcast, and yet is looked at has a threat by many. Superman is not from this world, yet He is trying to be human, find a place in this world, be excepted by earths people, and come into his destiny.This film is also about Batman being Batman for 20 years and losing faith in humanity, and fearing Superman, what Superman can do with his powers. Great film, great plot, great visuals. ---Yidioo"
"I didn't see the film in the theaters and just bought the \"Extended Edition \" on Amazon. I never properly saw Man of Steel- i think I rented it and watched it when already exhausted and fell asleep. I saw the mediocre user reviews and horrible reviews from critics of this film.They really have it wrong. This is the very best either Batman or Superman. It has a different take, on things. Much darker then earlier films even darker then the Christopher Nolan Batman films.First of all Christopher Nolan is an Executive Producer. So how bad could it be? I loved Sucker Punch and Zack Snyder was involved with that. So how bad could this be? Hans Zimmer did the music, so how bad could it be?I remember watching the old Superman TV shows and reading the Superman and Batman comics as a little kid and loved them, but i wouldn't call myself a \"fan boy\" of comic universes, like so many younger people today. As an older adult I will admit my favorite TV show of all time was Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but watched it on DVD only after it had finished. I saw the second of the Dark Knight series in the theater, but the other two, I watched on DVD. They were great, but not my favorite films like so many people. i also loved the first couple Superman and Batman films in the older series. Regardless, i was not waiting with baited breath to see Man of Steel or this one.I'm more of a serious film fan, who can watch Stanley Kubrick films over and over and my favorite films in the last twenty years, are Eyes Wide Shut and Intersteller, both of which i've watched multiple times.So, with that said, take it from me, the critics have this film very wrong, just as critics hated 2001: A Space Odyssey when it first came out. This film will have lasting appreciation.Surprised how much I liked Ben Afleck's Batman. it was hard to get into Henry Cavil's scrawnier looking Superman, but it grew on me. Amy Adams was great as Lois Lane, The Gal Gadol Wonder Women was amazing. Lex Luther was terrific, like Nolan's Joker. Jeremy Irons was the best Alfred ever. Holly Hunter and Diane Lane was good too. The movie had bad reviews but made a billion dollars. Hopefully everyone buys the Ultimate Edition and it breaks sales records and the film is re-appreciated. I have no idea what scenes this Ultimate Edition added, but it is pretty perfect. Now I can't wait for Wonder Woman and the Justice League and as soon as I finish writing this am going to watch Man of Steal. I'm into it now!I can only surmise that the bad reviews stem from too much expectations of the rigid fan boy types and the radical changes in tone, we see in this film.Total masterpiece of cinema, but I have a few criticisms. There are a few hollow scenes of typical Idiot cops and authorities getting everything wrong in a cliché type way and it has a few filler scenes of that type and a few moments here and there that felt rushed and cheesy. Maybe not everything restored into the Ultimate Edition should have been. I wish there had been more Kevin Costner scenes."

"The whole entire Batman V Superman movie was great and yes even though it felt slow to the majority of the people who watched it but to me I enjoyed every part and every scene of Batman V Superman and when it got to the fight scenes both batman VS Superman and the Doomsday fight it brought so much drama, intensity, and epic performances. So with that being said I give this movie a good 10/10 because it really did go to my expectations and it brought a powerful performance and a powerful yet epic introduction to the upcoming Justice League."

"When I first wrote a review for this movie a year ago exclaiming my excitement for the film, I had been high off a fresh dose of live-action DC superheroes playing out the beloved comic book stories that I had grown up on. It was all playing out before my eyes and coming to life. After a few months had passed, I began to notice things about the movie that I disliked: little gaps in the story, things that didn't add up, etc. My original rating of a 10 / 10 dropped to an 8 /10. But today it has gone back up to a 10. The extended version of the film not only rectifies the gaps but also silences critics.Many claimed that the movie was too dark or that it just didn't make sense. To those people, I say: \"Pick up a comic book!\" Many of the critics of this particular film were part of the superhero bandwagon that formed when Marvel began its spree of Avengers-related films. In fact, its estimated that over 60% of people who go to see 'superhero' genre films have never picked up a comic book in their life. I would argue that similar numbers could figure to those which view the CW televised DC Universe shows. People complain that DC comics is just too dark but the fact is that these movies are based upon actual comics which are meant to be dark (ex: The Dark Knight Returns, Injustice, etc.). Its like complaining that Game of Thrones (the TV series) sucks because they kill off too many characters. Read the books! Its frustrating to see such a beautiful work of art like Batman V Superman criticized by those ignorant to its universe and its meaning. This movie is in fact a catalyst that opens numerous doorways and leaves true fans in awe of the possibilities for future movies. But regardless of whether or not people choose to educate themselves, this film's DVD/Blu-ray extended version puts the theater release to shame. All of the plot holes and gaps are filled in 30 minutes of extended footage scattered throughout the film. The movie ultimately becomes more complete and people will wish that the movie had shown the full 3 hours of footage in its theatrical debut. As a major DC comics fan, I will of course pick up on things that a comics fan would not, but someone who does not read comics would learn to appreciate this film in its entirety with the extended version. Get your hands on a copy today or find it on Netflix or the internet somewhere!"

"I ignored the bad reviews and watched anyways. This film had a lot to live up to after Civil War was released and I went into this film expecting the worst. It ended up to be the best Superhero film of 2016 to me. One complaint was that this film was more concerned about universe building than telling a great story than Civil War but for me it was the other way around; Civil War felt like a build up to something else and to be honest, I felt that way when I saw the other MCU films. Batman vs Superman however not only had a great story, but it also felt a lot more consistent than Civil War. This film was way more diverse with the cast than the MCU but unlike the MCU, I felt like this film doesn't go overboard with the SJW stuff like the MCU films or The Star Wars Sequel films do. The Visuals were AMAZING, The Score by Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL was AMAZING as well, The Tone is just right as I actually felt for the characters emotionally, The Cinematography kept my eyes glued to the screen, and the script felt really Intelligent and Complex and despite people calling the writing confusing, I was able to piece it together with no problem whatsoever. This film is similar to Empire Strikes back in terms of popularity so over time after the other movies are released, this movie would probably be more popular.This film was way better than I Expected and deserves another chance.

"Its shame to see what critics and marvel fans did to this movie and targeted Zack Snyder for it. I have seen this movie more than 25 times till date. And i enjoy this movie as much as i enjoyed the first time. The fans who have read DC comics, wouldn't be disappointed in this movie. Its dark movie, yes it is. Because the title shows the intense situation at hand. Two superheroes about to rip each other apart for whatever reasons that brought them to this stage. Yes it had to be dark and intense.Only marvel can be stupid enough to show an alien invasion where humans are loosing the battle and the super heroes are cracking jokes while battles as if they are playing ping pong. a person playing Call of Duty game is more serious while playing than the marvel heroes fighting aliens."

"Last week some news came out from somebody online who had claimed to have seen a finished version of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. If you were like me, you've been leery of checking it out because you weren't sure how much might actually be true. Now Zack Snyder has spoken out about the spoiler-filled post, although his response doesn't really clear anything up.In a word, to MTV, he called the post \"hilarious,which might imply that he's saying that it's mostly, if not entirely, untrue. That might be the case, but then again he could have just said it was untrue and he didn't say that. What he did say, however, is that he doesn't like spoilers. While this may seem odd for the director who's most recent trailer appeared to give away the entire movie, Snyder says that's not the case. Even if you've seen the trailer, you can rest easy, as there is much more we have not seen in then finished film. Says Snyder I have the benefit of seeing the movie. It's cool that think it's too much, and I appreciate people not wanting to know, but there's plenty that they don't know. There's a lot of movie that's not in the trailer. In the process of calling the Batman v Superman Reddit review hilarious, Snyder goes on to talk about how he hates it when spoilers come out. The director would much rather that fans see the movie mostly blind. While he understands that some fans may wish to find the answers before hand, he wants his movies to be mysteries going in. If you're, as an audience member, exploring these articles, looking for answers to questions that you have, maybe you're okay with knowing before you go. It's like an individual taste. But like I said, I want people to see the movie without knowing.Spoilers are a topic that mean different things to different people. While most try to avoid them to some degree, the need to solve the mystery is a nearly universal human experience. We have an inclination to want to know the truth, even while also wanting to be surprised. For most of us getting some information is good, but getting all the information is bad, of course, only getting the details that you want can be difficult."
"The theatrical is choppy, poorly edited, hard to follow, with some really good moments mixed in their. The extended is much more fluent and is much easier to follow, it does have a long runtime, which might make it seem a bit dragging on, but if you like long films done right, like Lord of the Rings, you will like this movie as long as you get into the characters and story. Speaking of which, the story starts out perfectly showing Bruce Wayne as a character, and it is very powerful. There are several moments in this movie that are powerful, emotional, and shocking. Characters. Batman is my favorite fictional character of all time, and believe me when I say, Ben Affleck as Batman was perfect, he had the charisma, the anger, and the look of being through some bad stuff Gal Gadot also does perfect as Wonder Woman, but if you want to really see how good she does, go watch the Wonder Woman movie. Henry Call as Superman. I really don't like it when people say Christopher Reeves is better. Don't get me wrong, Reeves does great, but can you imagine him as Superman in this movie? I wouldn't like it. It would be like Adam West playing Batman in The Dark Knight. Henry Cavill does great in this role, I can say everything about him as I said with Ben Affleck. Jesse Eisenberg as Luthor. I thought it was different in a good way. I've heard a criticism for him as being too much like Joker, but is that a bad thing? Joker is my favorite villain, so to see Superman have an enemy that crazy, but still hold the values Luthor needs to be Luthor, I think it is great. The thing I thought this movie was lacking in the first and second acts was humor, at least good humor. If there was more humor, I would've given this movie a ten because it would give a more relaxing feel to the parts that needed it. All in all though, this movie was awesome, it had powerful moments, it was badass, and just plain fun. It had a great story arc and does its job very well."

"*I will be talking about the Ultimate Edition of the film* This was one of the most anticipated CBM of all time. Ever since the arrival and subsequent success of Marvel's The Avengers people have wondered when will DC launch its own cinematic universe, one of the main reasons being the opportunity to finally see titans such as Batman and Superman share the screen together: the ultimate nerd dream. On 2016, the moment finally came for BvS to be released AND.. it performed poorly. Not only did critical reception left a lot to be desired, but fan reactions where surprisingly split after its cinematic debut. People either loved it and called Zack a genius, or hated it and called him a hack. Me, personally, I found myself with middle of the road feelings, for sure, but more leaning towards the negative side with subsequent viewings. The theatrical cut of the film showcased amazing performances, incredible visuals, and action set pieces that seemed like comic book panels come to life, in a good way. However, when it comes to its narrative structure and more technical aspects like editing, the film was seriously flawed. More plot holes than Age of Ultron, questionable character decisions, random editing that lacked cohesion and focus, and forced dramatic moments that lacked any impact because the attempts at character development ranged from limited to nonexistent, especially when it comes to Superman's character. I thought it was a 5/10 movie at best. As such, I was kind of skeptical about the idea of a 30 minute longer version. I say kind of because I know how Zack works. I remember Watchmen being vastly improved with its director's cut, so in a way I was expecting BvS to perform in a similar manner, but I also feared those 30 minutes wold be just there to amplify action and discredit storytelling issues. Oh boy, I'm so glad I was proved wrong. The ultimate cut of the film was infuriating, but not because it was awful, but because it questions the sanity of WB executives and editors and makes you wonder what were they thinking during the editing process. What I got out of the Ultimate Edition was a thought-provoking deconstruction of two very iconic superheroes that gave spotlight to the struggles both of them face when they aren't fighting crime. What I got was an extremely well produced character study on both Batman and Superman in a cynical world, a world dangerously close to our own. We meet Batman as a ruthless, worn out hero that has seen the failure behind his ideals and witnessed some truly horrifying things in his life. Superman, on the other hand, is portrayed as a godlike figure that seeks to do good in the world, but finds himself emotionally conflicted once he realized that every good deed he does leaves behind a trail of destruction (most of it due to Luthor's antics). In my opinion, this is a hugely original approach, one that distances itself from the rest of the competition and delivers a dark, somber, yet relevant superhero movie that understands both characters and gives them real human struggles to deal with. I felt invested in both of them, and hoped that by the end of the film both could find a way to redeem themselves. Their character arcs were very well established during the first two acts of the movie, and by the time we get to the titular climactic battle the emotion behind the jaw-dropping action is intensified. Lex Luthor as a villain was also given more time to develop with this new edition. One of the main criticisms with the original version was the fact that his plan relied too much on conveniences, and the character's mannerisms and mad-scientist attitude was annoying, and that goes without saying his motivations were unclear. Not only do we spend more time understanding his hate for any godlike figure and thus his hatred for Superman, but the added scenes allowed us to witness his entire plan come to fruition. It sells the cold, manipulative, calculating attributes of his comic counterpart. The acting is spot on. Every actor owns his/her role, from Cavill's Superman, to Ben Affleck as Batman, Eisenberg as Luthor, and Gadot as Wonder Woman, whose scenes are brief, but are more than enough to sell the strong and ferocious warrior that she is. Cinematography is stunning, and miles above that of Man of Steel's. And the soundtrack by Zimmer and Junkie XL? Perfect, just perfect. When it comes to flaws, the film still has some of those. The Martha moment, while serving as a pivotal character moment for Batman, felt off in execution, and its understandable that many people got mad at it. If your main complaint about BvS the first time around was its bleak tone and subject matter, this film is still not for you. I understand most were expecting to see the heroes being the most iconic versions of themselves, clashing in an elongated battle and evoking the same feelings The Avengers gave audiences back in 2012. In that sense, the film will remain divisive, but at least I have the comfort of saying that, at the very least, the film is competently made."

"This film was amazing. Ben Affleck was easily the best part of this movie, he brought his a-game as Batman. The chemistry between Affleck & Irons was outstanding. Gal Gadot did a great job as Wonder Woman. The fight between Batman & Superman was awesome. The final fight with Doomsday was outstanding in every way possible. However, there is only one problem with this film and that's Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor. He was sadly missed cast in this role, but then again it's really the fault of Warner Bros. Studios. Overall, this film deliver on almost every level. I highly recommend that you watch the extended version of this film."

"I know I know. I saw it in theaters too, and felt like it could've been so much better. While the Batman element was good, the narrative felt fractured, and the third act was just one long stunt scene. Superman was relegated to a supporting character, and other characters didn't get a chance to shine. And then I chanced on the ultimate cut. Calling it 30 mins of \"extra\" footage is unfair to Zack Snyder because it's exactly these 30 mins that makes the movie a worthy one. What I can say about the theatrical cut is this - It had the blockbuster elements - music, visuals, stunts, CGI. But, it lacked the human elements. The first 20 mins of the movie had it, but not after that. The extended cut in comparison has a flow to the narrative. There are no disjointed scenes, everything flows smoothly, and there's connective tissue. Superman gets to spend some time with his father, and mother. Clark Kent does some investigative journalism. Superman helps the people after the blast. Lois Lane doesn't jump to conclusions, she gets to the bottom of the crime. Lex Luthor apparently had a coherent plan - everything is explained pretty well. Wonder Woman was already good, so there's no change there :) Also, the \"Martha\" scene seems better executed, because it is a few seconds longer, and there's time to breathe it in. So, here's my take on this movie - The theatrical cut was junk. Get the Bluray for ultimate edition, and you shall not be disappointed. I've seen it so many more times now, and it's the definitive cut. It is the movie we deserve. It's a unique take on Batman, and Superman. It's a gritty take on the superhero movie genre, and definitely the best DCEU movie, and the best DC movie since The Dark Knight.P.S. Yes it's dark. We're adults, and we should appreciate mature film making without intentionally silly moments. It attempts to be philosophical, and something deep instead of just trying to make you chuckle."

"This is one of the best superhero movies ever made. Zack Snyder is a magician behind the camera.The reason behind so many complaints is the fact that Warner Bros. marketed this movie as a fight between Batman and Superman. That's not what it is. It's a movie about the origins of the Justice League.The cinematography, the acting and the score are all second to none. This film is phenomenal.P.S: watch the 3 hour extended cut that Snyder intended you to see, not the 2 and a half hour movie that Warner Bros. decided would be better for theaters."

"I don't care what the critics say, this is a very well-done movie. I'll start my review by listing what I like about the movie.1.) Ben Affleck is the best batman to me and it is not close. He pulls off the role of an aging batman extremely well. Also, Zack Snyder's vision of batman is legit. I have always hated batman up until this adaptation of him. Instead of being a conflicted and idealistic batman, this batman is dark, gritty, and 100% a badass. His equipment is decked out with machine guns and he has no aversion to killing people. In fact, he probably kills about 50 criminal by the time this movie is over. The warehouse scene is the coolest batman scene in any movie.2.) The development of a grudge between batman and superman is pulled off flawlessly. It actually makes sense why batman dislikes superman. Then, when they do fight it is about the coolest thing you can expect to see from a superhero film. 3.) I disagree with a lot of people about Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor. In my opinion, he played his role to perfection. 4.) B v S sets up Wonder Woman and Justice League with Gal Gadot's cameo as Wonder Woman and short clips of Aquaman, the Flash, and Cyborg. B v S is one of my favorite superhero films and rewatching it never gets old."

"The theatrical cut of this film is garbage which is why I rated it eight stars instead of nine. The first time I watched this film I didn't like it (not straight out hate but didn't like). Character motivations didn't make any sense, Lex was annoying as s***, editing was sloppy, and it was overly dark and broody for an action superhero movie. A year + a half, five Marvel films, a ton of bad reviews and a Justice League later a thought popped into my head: \"what if I watched BVS again\". This time I didn't have trailers ruining the best moments, I only vaguely remembered the film, and I was conditioned to look at it negatively but something unexpected happened: I actually loved it. Superman was just a normal person that tried to make a difference cause he could that others imposed their own beliefs on. Lex Luthor was a genius that couldn't stand his powerlessness compared to Superman or more accurately a super being. As Alfred said \"The fever, the rage, the feeling of powerlessness that turns good men... cruel\" and you see the same thought process in Batman. Batman, just like Lex Luthor feels powerless in the midst of a god-being and just like Lex he attempts to destroy him so he can get his sense of power back but unlike Lex, Batman learns something. I what is one of the corniest lines of the movie Superman says, \"Martha\" when he knows he can't win against Batman in a late desperate attempt to save his mother. Not only does this name connect with Bruce Wayne but it also shows what really matters to a man of steel: it isn't power, it isn't fame or anything else, it is his Mother and on a broader scale it is people. Lex (who doesn't care about people at all) knows he doesn't have the power so he creates something from his blood and the remains of Zod: A Doomsday for Superman. Not only does this film have depth but it also doesn't always explain it to you which is rare in a blockbuster action superhero flick normally cater to semi-comic book fans and people that want to shove popcorn in their mouths. This film rewards you for really noticing the details while still having massive explosions. One of my favorites is how Lex has all of Batman's branded killed which is why he isn't afraid of the branding at the end or Grandma's Peach Tea as a way of scaring the s*** out of someone. Of course, this film isn't perfect and I do have personal dislikes. The Batman V Superman fight was slow and pretty boring especially after watching such an amazing fight in Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 2 (If you haven't watched the animated Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 1 and 2 you are sorely missing out on something fantastic). Also, the addition of Wonder Woman who pretty much steals a hacker thing, gives it back and then suits up and fights against a giant monster thing. Not to say I don't like Wonder Woman (She is one of my favorite Superheroes of all time who showed not only can woman kick a** but they also don't need to be ashamed of their sexuality or gender) but she wasn't really that helpful to the plot and just brought in to expand the universe which was well done through Lex's superhuman hunting files. Also, the post-apocalyptic scene that was just a dream could have been cut but nothing is perfect except movies like Citizen Kane which isn't a lot of fun to watch cause it is too perfect. So to summarize, the theatrical cut is bad, the ultimate cut is Amazing and the other cut is meh. Please give it a second chance because it deserves it and save a good director from losing grace because of something he didn't do."
"I really liked it, don't know what all the hate is about. I'm actually a Marvel fan from when I was 7 or so, but Superman and Batman together in 1 movie? Just great. And personally I like Ben Affleck even better than Christian Bale as Batman. So just watch and enjoy, I know I did!"

"That's right. We have been waiting for these two heroes to finally meet and fight against each other. This movie is so good in both plot and special effects.Henry Cavill and Ben Affleck have performed well in their acting stages. They are the best superhero actors and they have filmed their fighting scenes very well. The movie starts to show the conflict between the lives of the heroes and now they have blamed each other for it. This movie is amazing and sets up a good plot for Dawn Justice."

"Actually...I didn't know what to expect. When you see Wonder Woman, you know it will be off of Wonder Woman and off of a Wonder Woman story, but with Batman V Superman, I was like, \"hmmmm, so who is this about?\" It was pretty obvious that it would feature many characters, but I thought the introduction to Batman was amazing. Ben Affleck nailed the part, not only as Batman but also as Bruce Wayne. He is my Batman. Henry Cavill continued to be super as the Man of Steel. And he is my Super - Man. A dark story? Yes, without a doubt. Could it have had a few more jokes? Sure. But not all movies or stories need to have jokes when certain events are serious. I really hope people can see this review and take another look at the movie, because, I loved it. I really hope the ratings can go up, eventually. And P.S, this movie is the perfect set up to Justice League."

"I'll start by making it clear I have only ever seen the Ultimate Edition. I'm aware of what was cut out for the theatrical release, so I will concede up front that most of the criticisms about pacing, editing, and missing bits of plot at release were merited.With that caveat out of the way, I must reiterate that this was bar-none the boldest superhero movie I have ever seen. To me, it was arguably the best as well, though \"best\" shouldn't be taken to mean \"most enjoyable.\" That honor easily goes to \"Thor: Ragnarok.\" What makes BvS stand out among other films in the genre is that it takes two characters who have been done to death since the 1970s and brings them up to date. I recently tried to watch \"Superman: The Movie\" for the first time in a number of years, and while it was still good and Reeves will always be iconic, I just couldn't take it seriously. I'll put it this way: If the story in BvS was \"stupid\" in your view but Superman turning back time by spinning the earth backward on its axis didn't seem like one of the dumbest things you have ever seen -in any movie from any genre- to the extent that it outright ruins the movie for you, then your opinion about BvS isn't worth much. Nostalgic bias was always going to be a problem for this movie, and the way people reacted to and reviewed \"Man of Steel\" was telling in this regard.That brings me to Zack Snyder's take on Superman. You know, that guy whose status as the first extraterrestrial ever encountered by humanity was a total non-issue in the old movies. Apparently, Snyder has a similar view to my own in that his take on the Man of Steel makes his being an alien a core piece of his identity. He may look like any other (absurdly attractive) person, but he knows what he is, and that makes him perpetually uncertain of where he fits in this world. He is essentially good and really does care about people, but he struggles to truly empathize with the likes of us. To be human is to be frail, and that is not something he can easily relate to. This is the root of his conflict with Batman.Just as Clark struggles to genuinely relate to most people, Snyder's Batman either refuses to or otherwise just can't relate to Superman. He doesn't see him as anything but a threat regardless of Superman's clear good intentions. Remember, a small group of Kryptonians were able to bring humanity to the brink of extinction in less than a day, and Bruce Wayne is nothing if not a realist. He didn't know the guy from Kansas. He only knew the god from another world.While Batman's anger toward and fear of Superman are readily apparent from the start, Superman's inability to imagine things from Bruce Wayne's perspective only becomes truly apparent during their first real interaction. This reminded me of the animated version of the \"world's finest\" storyline, where Superman judges Batman harshly for using fear tactics and threats of violence (also, actual violence) to get the job done. Superman wasn't willing to consider what it would take for a human man to fight criminals and save innocents, or what that life would do to him over time. Just as Batman didn't see the guy from Kansas, Superman didn't see the man who lives his life trapped in one brutal, unthinkably traumatic moment (this was beautifully conveyed during the film's opening moments), and had spent his whole adult life bearing witness to humanity at its absolute worst.The conflict between these two characters is as old as human history. They want the same things, but they can't understand one another. So they fight. And what a fight it was.Watching a fight between, say, Captain America and Iron Man was, to me, more frustrating than anything because each understood the other's perspective perfectly. The fight between Batman and Superman in BvS was genuinely gut-wrenching, as intended, because they would have understood one another if either had tried. The whole sequence hilighted Batman's tactical prowess and ability to control a situation. Maybe the most badass thing about the fight was that it ended exactly where Batman planned. That brings me to the big elephant in the room named \"Martha.\"I can't recall exactly which YouTuber put it this way, but if you thought the \"save Martha\" exchange was about their mothers having the same name, you had your brain turned off. The brain-on people have explained this to death, but it bears repeating. This was the moment when Superman became humanized to Batman. He was about to die, and his only concern was for his adoptive human mother. He still believed that the man about to take his life would do the right thing. Even with the cowl on, there was no mistaking the look on Batman's face. It was the look of shame, guilt, and sudden uncertainty that says \"What am I doing?\" Turns out even the most brutal, angry version of Bruce Wayne is better than Tony Stark at knowing right from wrong. At knowing that he had gone too far.From there, the third act was a series of truly impressive (albeit mostly CGI) fight sequences, beginning with what I regard as the undisputed champion of Batman fights. Nothing in the Nolan movies (and especially nothing in the Burton movies) even came close. Go ahead, try to convince yourself that Batman and Bane taking turns punching one another in the face until Bane's mask broke was a good fight sequence. No, this was a fight straight out of \"Arkham Knight,\" and it was glorious. The battle against Doomsday really was one for the books. From the moment Wonder Woman arrived accompanied by the intense sounds of Tina Guo's electric cello to Superman's tragic, heroic death at the hands of Doomsday, I was glued to the screen. Sure, the mere presence of Doomsday spoiled the end to a degree, but watching the Man of Steel laboring to carry that kryptonite spear towards certain death was no less impactful. A brief word on Jesse Eisenberg's take on Lex Luthor. At least one other reviewer on this site already said it best when they pointed out that this was his origin story. If you consider his scheme objectively, he is actually one of the more formidable incarnations of the character. If we're lucky, we'll eventually get to see a Snyder Cut of \"Justice League\" and find out where this story was actually meant to go. For the record, Joss Whedon and Danny Elfman both should have said \"no\" to taking a dump on someone else's art."
"BATMAN V SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE brings a fantastic surprise to a smash-hit team-up with one of the worlds most beloved DC Comics' icons of all time. The movie delivers spectacular casting, and fantastic acting with different characters having their shine in each scenes.The story follows Clark Kent/Superman who becomes a threat, after the destruction in Metropolis in Man Of Steel.(2013). Batman/Bruce Wayne sees him as a threat and begins his war on Superman.The movie brings spectacular storytelling, it tells the complications of human against alien who are on the same side, and the first meeting of Batman and Superman. The story of Bruce Wayne, with his many years of The Caped Crusader, sends him on a spiral of \"out of control\", sheer anger, and builds tension to wanting to defeat the Man of Steel. Snyder has fantastically gave this storytelling an exciting nod to the comics.Lex Luthor, played by Jesse Einsberg, delivers a very interesting performance, but very differently by him showing is his \"origin\" before he becomes a bald foe to the Man of Steel. He shows that his love of \"god vs man\" terrorises mankind when he ultimately creates Doomsday, and Batman realises Superman's inner heroism.It packs so many great \"out of nowhere\" excitement, including a first-look of the fearful Wonder Woman a.k.a. Diana Prince, played by Gal Gadot, and a fresh-new glimpse of the superhero DC canon: The Justice League.WATCH THIS MOVIE! The critics are out of their mind. It's a fun-packed action adventure which still keeps the movie enjoyable until it's final minutes of the movie. It's a FANTASTIC MOVIE! BEN AFFLECK AS BATMAN... is Incredible!A 10/10 overall!"
"I want to go on record as saying that this is a truly thrilling cinematic experience in so many ways. If pressed, I guess I could acknowledge that there were a couple ... let's say \"clumsy\" moments. And in a film that runs to three hours, that hardly seems like a significant issue, certainly not enough to rate it with fewer than 9 stars.This film has everything. There is dramatic tension right from the start. There is a magnificent story arc that picks up quite seamlessly from 'Man of Steel' and propels the viewer not only into the life of Clark Kent/Superman but also of Bruce Wayne/Batman.The villain is no mere cartoon of a villain; he is truly thoroughly (and apparently irrevocably) diabolical. He is a psychopath, and you wish for his death over and over and over. You want Superman to reduce him to ash with the power of his eyes.I have read a number of viewers' reviews, and it seems that the people who disliked the film / gave it a low rating had rather unfair and unrealistic expectations of it. That is, their own prejudices about how the plot could/should unfold or what the character development could/should be, etc. ruined the film for them. And that is a shame.My thought is: I settle into my seat, wait for the lights to dim, and then I wait to be transported by the film. I accept it, lock, stock, and barrel.As another reviewer remarked, I love how the film begins from the point of view of Bruce Wayne as he is among people on the ground who have fallen victim to the attack of Zod and the other Kryptonians.Why would Bruce Wayne not like Superman? Why would the good people of Earth hurl insults at Superman and burn him in effigy (on the news)? Because the good people of Earth just got catapulted into a new reality in which there are not only extraterrestrial beings (surprise!) but they are also superman! And a group of them are hell-bent on destroying humankind and taking the planet for themselves.It is difficult to see Superman as separate from the whole Kryptonian Krew.It seems that many moviegoers forgot that Bruce Wayne is also human. Sure, he's a hero, but he is flawed.. Just like the rest of us. He is a vigilante, after all.He has let his vigilantism get the better of him. HE is actually the one working outside the boundaries of the law, not Superman. It is the clear head of Alfred that shows us that he has gone into a rather dark place, that he has not seen what is really going on (in Luthor's scheme), and so he chooses to embark on his own scheme scheme to take out the alien invader. He is (allegedly) thinking of the future: if he wipes out the all-powerful alien, then it can't turn on humankind in the future. At least, he convinces himself of that.A philosophical question is raised in the film: should Clark Kent have remained a simple man from Kansas and never have become the Superman? Should he just let people die and let calamities happen? The question is answered for us in the character of Diana Prince/Wonder Woman. She withdrew from mankind (her exact words) and just sat around watching. Watching while people died horrible deaths all around her. So, should Superman have done the same? Do these special beings, these 'metahumans', have some kind of moral imperative to intervene, or should they be allowed to be regular people, too? It seems that humans want it both ways.It seems that humans are saying: \"Don't be a superalien ... except when I and my friends and family are in trouble. Then come save us.\""

"Batman v Superman: Ultimate Edition: If your looking for a quick, cheap thrill then you might not enjoy this film at the time. This movies theatrical version was butchered by WB and in doing so reshaped the story leaving numerous plot holes. So the Ultimate Edition is the full story and the one worth seeing. Watch 'Man of Steel' before seeing this movie. There is much to claw through here, so much so that the audience might easily find themselves exhausted from the overall aggression of the film. However, a lot of the story does work. The action is good, and the emotion feels real most of the time.This film is about Superman trying to become Superman. Trying to help the world, save people, find a place in this world not as an outcast, and yet is looked at has a threat by many. Superman is not from this world, yet He is trying to be human, find a place in this world, be excepted by earths people, and come into his destiny.This film is also about Batman being Batman for 20 years and losing faith in humanity, and fearing Superman, what Superman can do with his powers. Great film, great plot, great visuals. ---Yidioo"
"I didn't see the film in the theaters and just bought the \"Extended Edition \" on Amazon. I never properly saw Man of Steel- i think I rented it and watched it when already exhausted and fell asleep. I saw the mediocre user reviews and horrible reviews from critics of this film.They really have it wrong. This is the very best either Batman or Superman. It has a different take, on things. Much darker then earlier films even darker then the Christopher Nolan Batman films.First of all Christopher Nolan is an Executive Producer. So how bad could it be? I loved Sucker Punch and Zack Snyder was involved with that. So how bad could this be? Hans Zimmer did the music, so how bad could it be?I remember watching the old Superman TV shows and reading the Superman and Batman comics as a little kid and loved them, but i wouldn't call myself a \"fan boy\" of comic universes, like so many younger people today. As an older adult I will admit my favorite TV show of all time was Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but watched it on DVD only after it had finished. I saw the second of the Dark Knight series in the theater, but the other two, I watched on DVD. They were great, but not my favorite films like so many people. i also loved the first couple Superman and Batman films in the older series. Regardless, i was not waiting with baited breath to see Man of Steel or this one.I'm more of a serious film fan, who can watch Stanley Kubrick films over and over and my favorite films in the last twenty years, are Eyes Wide Shut and Intersteller, both of which i've watched multiple times.So, with that said, take it from me, the critics have this film very wrong, just as critics hated 2001: A Space Odyssey when it first came out. This film will have lasting appreciation.Surprised how much I liked Ben Afleck's Batman. it was hard to get into Henry Cavil's scrawnier looking Superman, but it grew on me. Amy Adams was great as Lois Lane, The Gal Gadol Wonder Women was amazing. Lex Luther was terrific, like Nolan's Joker. Jeremy Irons was the best Alfred ever. Holly Hunter and Diane Lane was good too. The movie had bad reviews but made a billion dollars. Hopefully everyone buys the Ultimate Edition and it breaks sales records and the film is re-appreciated. I have no idea what scenes this Ultimate Edition added, but it is pretty perfect. Now I can't wait for Wonder Woman and the Justice League and as soon as I finish writing this am going to watch Man of Steal. I'm into it now!I can only surmise that the bad reviews stem from too much expectations of the rigid fan boy types and the radical changes in tone, we see in this film.Total masterpiece of cinema, but I have a few criticisms. There are a few hollow scenes of typical Idiot cops and authorities getting everything wrong in a cliché type way and it has a few filler scenes of that type and a few moments here and there that felt rushed and cheesy. Maybe not everything restored into the Ultimate Edition should have been. I wish there had been more Kevin Costner scenes."

"The whole entire Batman V Superman movie was great and yes even though it felt slow to the majority of the people who watched it but to me I enjoyed every part and every scene of Batman V Superman and when it got to the fight scenes both batman VS Superman and the Doomsday fight it brought so much drama, intensity, and epic performances. So with that being said I give this movie a good 10/10 because it really did go to my expectations and it brought a powerful performance and a powerful yet epic introduction to the upcoming Justice League."

"Zack Snyder not only understands the characters but he also understands how to craft a real amazing movie for fans - honestly blew me away (extended cut) Brilliant!Don't believe what the internet is telling you to think - take this from a person who has worked in the comic book industry - this is amazing!"

"When I first wrote a review for this movie a year ago exclaiming my excitement for the film, I had been high off a fresh dose of live-action DC superheroes playing out the beloved comic book stories that I had grown up on. It was all playing out before my eyes and coming to life. After a few months had passed, I began to notice things about the movie that I disliked: little gaps in the story, things that didn't add up, etc. My original rating of a 10 / 10 dropped to an 8 /10. But today it has gone back up to a 10. The extended version of the film not only rectifies the gaps but also silences critics.Many claimed that the movie was too dark or that it just didn't make sense. To those people, I say: \"Pick up a comic book!\" Many of the critics of this particular film were part of the superhero bandwagon that formed when Marvel began its spree of Avengers-related films. In fact, its estimated that over 60% of people who go to see 'superhero' genre films have never picked up a comic book in their life. I would argue that similar numbers could figure to those which view the CW televised DC Universe shows. People complain that DC comics is just too dark but the fact is that these movies are based upon actual comics which are meant to be dark (ex: The Dark Knight Returns, Injustice, etc.). Its like complaining that Game of Thrones (the TV series) sucks because they kill off too many characters. Read the books! Its frustrating to see such a beautiful work of art like Batman V Superman criticized by those ignorant to its universe and its meaning. This movie is in fact a catalyst that opens numerous doorways and leaves true fans in awe of the possibilities for future movies. But regardless of whether or not people choose to educate themselves, this film's DVD/Blu-ray extended version puts the theater release to shame. All of the plot holes and gaps are filled in 30 minutes of extended footage scattered throughout the film. The movie ultimately becomes more complete and people will wish that the movie had shown the full 3 hours of footage in its theatrical debut. As a major DC comics fan, I will of course pick up on things that a comics fan would not, but someone who does not read comics would learn to appreciate this film in its entirety with the extended version. Get your hands on a copy today or find it on Netflix or the internet somewhere!"

"I ignored the bad reviews and watched anyways. This film had a lot to live up to after Civil War was released and I went into this film expecting the worst. It ended up to be the best Superhero film of 2016 to me. One complaint was that this film was more concerned about universe building than telling a great story than Civil War but for me it was the other way around; Civil War felt like a build up to something else and to be honest, I felt that way when I saw the other MCU films. Batman vs Superman however not only had a great story, but it also felt a lot more consistent than Civil War. This film was way more diverse with the cast than the MCU but unlike the MCU, I felt like this film doesn't go overboard with the SJW stuff like the MCU films or The Star Wars Sequel films do. The Visuals were AMAZING, The Score by Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL was AMAZING as well, The Tone is just right as I actually felt for the characters emotionally, The Cinematography kept my eyes glued to the screen, and the script felt really Intelligent and Complex and despite people calling the writing confusing, I was able to piece it together with no problem whatsoever. This film is similar to Empire Strikes back in terms of popularity so over time after the other movies are released, this movie would probably be more popular.This film was way better than I Expected and deserves another chance.

"Its shame to see what critics and marvel fans did to this movie and targeted Zack Snyder for it. I have seen this movie more than 25 times till date. And i enjoy this movie as much as i enjoyed the first time. The fans who have read DC comics, wouldn't be disappointed in this movie. Its dark movie, yes it is. Because the title shows the intense situation at hand. Two superheroes about to rip each other apart for whatever reasons that brought them to this stage. Yes it had to be dark and intense.Only marvel can be stupid enough to show an alien invasion where humans are loosing the battle and the super heroes are cracking jokes while battles as if they are playing ping pong. a person playing Call of Duty game is more serious while playing than the marvel heroes fighting aliens."

"Last week some news came out from somebody online who had claimed to have seen a finished version of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. If you were like me, you've been leery of checking it out because you weren't sure how much might actually be true. Now Zack Snyder has spoken out about the spoiler-filled post, although his response doesn't really clear anything up.In a word, to MTV, he called the post \"hilarious,which might imply that he's saying that it's mostly, if not entirely, untrue. That might be the case, but then again he could have just said it was untrue and he didn't say that. What he did say, however, is that he doesn't like spoilers. While this may seem odd for the director who's most recent trailer appeared to give away the entire movie, Snyder says that's not the case. Even if you've seen the trailer, you can rest easy, as there is much more we have not seen in then finished film. Says Snyder I have the benefit of seeing the movie. It's cool that think it's too much, and I appreciate people not wanting to know, but there's plenty that they don't know. There's a lot of movie that's not in the trailer. In the process of calling the Batman v Superman Reddit review hilarious, Snyder goes on to talk about how he hates it when spoilers come out. The director would much rather that fans see the movie mostly blind. While he understands that some fans may wish to find the answers before hand, he wants his movies to be mysteries going in. If you're, as an audience member, exploring these articles, looking for answers to questions that you have, maybe you're okay with knowing before you go. It's like an individual taste. But like I said, I want people to see the movie without knowing.Spoilers are a topic that mean different things to different people. While most try to avoid them to some degree, the need to solve the mystery is a nearly universal human experience. We have an inclination to want to know the truth, even while also wanting to be surprised. For most of us getting some information is good, but getting all the information is bad, of course, only getting the details that you want can be difficult."
"The theatrical is choppy, poorly edited, hard to follow, with some really good moments mixed in their. The extended is much more fluent and is much easier to follow, it does have a long runtime, which might make it seem a bit dragging on, but if you like long films done right, like Lord of the Rings, you will like this movie as long as you get into the characters and story. Speaking of which, the story starts out perfectly showing Bruce Wayne as a character, and it is very powerful. There are several moments in this movie that are powerful, emotional, and shocking. Characters. Batman is my favorite fictional character of all time, and believe me when I say, Ben Affleck as Batman was perfect, he had the charisma, the anger, and the look of being through some bad stuff Gal Gadot also does perfect as Wonder Woman, but if you want to really see how good she does, go watch the Wonder Woman movie. Henry Call as Superman. I really don't like it when people say Christopher Reeves is better. Don't get me wrong, Reeves does great, but can you imagine him as Superman in this movie? I wouldn't like it. It would be like Adam West playing Batman in The Dark Knight. Henry Cavill does great in this role, I can say everything about him as I said with Ben Affleck. Jesse Eisenberg as Luthor. I thought it was different in a good way. I've heard a criticism for him as being too much like Joker, but is that a bad thing? Joker is my favorite villain, so to see Superman have an enemy that crazy, but still hold the values Luthor needs to be Luthor, I think it is great. The thing I thought this movie was lacking in the first and second acts was humor, at least good humor. If there was more humor, I would've given this movie a ten because it would give a more relaxing feel to the parts that needed it. All in all though, this movie was awesome, it had powerful moments, it was badass, and just plain fun. It had a great story arc and does its job very well."

"*I will be talking about the Ultimate Edition of the film* This was one of the most anticipated CBM of all time. Ever since the arrival and subsequent success of Marvel's The Avengers people have wondered when will DC launch its own cinematic universe, one of the main reasons being the opportunity to finally see titans such as Batman and Superman share the screen together: the ultimate nerd dream. On 2016, the moment finally came for BvS to be released AND.. it performed poorly. Not only did critical reception left a lot to be desired, but fan reactions where surprisingly split after its cinematic debut. People either loved it and called Zack a genius, or hated it and called him a hack. Me, personally, I found myself with middle of the road feelings, for sure, but more leaning towards the negative side with subsequent viewings. The theatrical cut of the film showcased amazing performances, incredible visuals, and action set pieces that seemed like comic book panels come to life, in a good way. However, when it comes to its narrative structure and more technical aspects like editing, the film was seriously flawed. More plot holes than Age of Ultron, questionable character decisions, random editing that lacked cohesion and focus, and forced dramatic moments that lacked any impact because the attempts at character development ranged from limited to nonexistent, especially when it comes to Superman's character. I thought it was a 5/10 movie at best. As such, I was kind of skeptical about the idea of a 30 minute longer version. I say kind of because I know how Zack works. I remember Watchmen being vastly improved with its director's cut, so in a way I was expecting BvS to perform in a similar manner, but I also feared those 30 minutes wold be just there to amplify action and discredit storytelling issues. Oh boy, I'm so glad I was proved wrong. The ultimate cut of the film was infuriating, but not because it was awful, but because it questions the sanity of WB executives and editors and makes you wonder what were they thinking during the editing process. What I got out of the Ultimate Edition was a thought-provoking deconstruction of two very iconic superheroes that gave spotlight to the struggles both of them face when they aren't fighting crime. What I got was an extremely well produced character study on both Batman and Superman in a cynical world, a world dangerously close to our own. We meet Batman as a ruthless, worn out hero that has seen the failure behind his ideals and witnessed some truly horrifying things in his life. Superman, on the other hand, is portrayed as a godlike figure that seeks to do good in the world, but finds himself emotionally conflicted once he realized that every good deed he does leaves behind a trail of destruction (most of it due to Luthor's antics). In my opinion, this is a hugely original approach, one that distances itself from the rest of the competition and delivers a dark, somber, yet relevant superhero movie that understands both characters and gives them real human struggles to deal with. I felt invested in both of them, and hoped that by the end of the film both could find a way to redeem themselves. Their character arcs were very well established during the first two acts of the movie, and by the time we get to the titular climactic battle the emotion behind the jaw-dropping action is intensified. Lex Luthor as a villain was also given more time to develop with this new edition. One of the main criticisms with the original version was the fact that his plan relied too much on conveniences, and the character's mannerisms and mad-scientist attitude was annoying, and that goes without saying his motivations were unclear. Not only do we spend more time understanding his hate for any godlike figure and thus his hatred for Superman, but the added scenes allowed us to witness his entire plan come to fruition. It sells the cold, manipulative, calculating attributes of his comic counterpart. The acting is spot on. Every actor owns his/her role, from Cavill's Superman, to Ben Affleck as Batman, Eisenberg as Luthor, and Gadot as Wonder Woman, whose scenes are brief, but are more than enough to sell the strong and ferocious warrior that she is. Cinematography is stunning, and miles above that of Man of Steel's. And the soundtrack by Zimmer and Junkie XL? Perfect, just perfect. When it comes to flaws, the film still has some of those. The Martha moment, while serving as a pivotal character moment for Batman, felt off in execution, and its understandable that many people got mad at it. If your main complaint about BvS the first time around was its bleak tone and subject matter, this film is still not for you. I understand most were expecting to see the heroes being the most iconic versions of themselves, clashing in an elongated battle and evoking the same feelings The Avengers gave audiences back in 2012. In that sense, the film will remain divisive, but at least I have the comfort of saying that, at the very least, the film is competently made."

"This film was amazing. Ben Affleck was easily the best part of this movie, he brought his a-game as Batman. The chemistry between Affleck & Irons was outstanding. Gal Gadot did a great job as Wonder Woman. The fight between Batman & Superman was awesome. The final fight with Doomsday was outstanding in every way possible. However, there is only one problem with this film and that's Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor. He was sadly missed cast in this role, but then again it's really the fault of Warner Bros. Studios. Overall, this film deliver on almost every level. I highly recommend that you watch the extended version of this film."

"I know I know. I saw it in theaters too, and felt like it could've been so much better. While the Batman element was good, the narrative felt fractured, and the third act was just one long stunt scene. Superman was relegated to a supporting character, and other characters didn't get a chance to shine. And then I chanced on the ultimate cut. Calling it 30 mins of \"extra\" footage is unfair to Zack Snyder because it's exactly these 30 mins that makes the movie a worthy one. What I can say about the theatrical cut is this - It had the blockbuster elements - music, visuals, stunts, CGI. But, it lacked the human elements. The first 20 mins of the movie had it, but not after that. The extended cut in comparison has a flow to the narrative. There are no disjointed scenes, everything flows smoothly, and there's connective tissue. Superman gets to spend some time with his father, and mother. Clark Kent does some investigative journalism. Superman helps the people after the blast. Lois Lane doesn't jump to conclusions, she gets to the bottom of the crime. Lex Luthor apparently had a coherent plan - everything is explained pretty well. Wonder Woman was already good, so there's no change there :) Also, the \"Martha\" scene seems better executed, because it is a few seconds longer, and there's time to breathe it in. So, here's my take on this movie - The theatrical cut was junk. Get the Bluray for ultimate edition, and you shall not be disappointed. I've seen it so many more times now, and it's the definitive cut. It is the movie we deserve. It's a unique take on Batman, and Superman. It's a gritty take on the superhero movie genre, and definitely the best DCEU movie, and the best DC movie since The Dark Knight.P.S. Yes it's dark. We're adults, and we should appreciate mature film making without intentionally silly moments. It attempts to be philosophical, and something deep instead of just trying to make you chuckle."

"This is one of the best superhero movies ever made. Zack Snyder is a magician behind the camera.The reason behind so many complaints is the fact that Warner Bros. marketed this movie as a fight between Batman and Superman. That's not what it is. It's a movie about the origins of the Justice League.The cinematography, the acting and the score are all second to none. This film is phenomenal.P.S: watch the 3 hour extended cut that Snyder intended you to see, not the 2 and a half hour movie that Warner Bros. decided would be better for theaters."

"I don't care what the critics say, this is a very well-done movie. I'll start my review by listing what I like about the movie.1.) Ben Affleck is the best batman to me and it is not close. He pulls off the role of an aging batman extremely well. Also, Zack Snyder's vision of batman is legit. I have always hated batman up until this adaptation of him. Instead of being a conflicted and idealistic batman, this batman is dark, gritty, and 100% a badass. His equipment is decked out with machine guns and he has no aversion to killing people. In fact, he probably kills about 50 criminal by the time this movie is over. The warehouse scene is the coolest batman scene in any movie.2.) The development of a grudge between batman and superman is pulled off flawlessly. It actually makes sense why batman dislikes superman. Then, when they do fight it is about the coolest thing you can expect to see from a superhero film. 3.) I disagree with a lot of people about Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor. In my opinion, he played his role to perfection. 4.) B v S sets up Wonder Woman and Justice League with Gal Gadot's cameo as Wonder Woman and short clips of Aquaman, the Flash, and Cyborg. B v S is one of my favorite superhero films and rewatching it never gets old."

"The theatrical cut of this film is garbage which is why I rated it eight stars instead of nine. The first time I watched this film I didn't like it (not straight out hate but didn't like). Character motivations didn't make any sense, Lex was annoying as s***, editing was sloppy, and it was overly dark and broody for an action superhero movie. A year + a half, five Marvel films, a ton of bad reviews and a Justice League later a thought popped into my head: \"what if I watched BVS again\". This time I didn't have trailers ruining the best moments, I only vaguely remembered the film, and I was conditioned to look at it negatively but something unexpected happened: I actually loved it. Superman was just a normal person that tried to make a difference cause he could that others imposed their own beliefs on. Lex Luthor was a genius that couldn't stand his powerlessness compared to Superman or more accurately a super being. As Alfred said \"The fever, the rage, the feeling of powerlessness that turns good men... cruel\" and you see the same thought process in Batman. Batman, just like Lex Luthor feels powerless in the midst of a god-being and just like Lex he attempts to destroy him so he can get his sense of power back but unlike Lex, Batman learns something. I what is one of the corniest lines of the movie Superman says, \"Martha\" when he knows he can't win against Batman in a late desperate attempt to save his mother. Not only does this name connect with Bruce Wayne but it also shows what really matters to a man of steel: it isn't power, it isn't fame or anything else, it is his Mother and on a broader scale it is people. Lex (who doesn't care about people at all) knows he doesn't have the power so he creates something from his blood and the remains of Zod: A Doomsday for Superman. Not only does this film have depth but it also doesn't always explain it to you which is rare in a blockbuster action superhero flick normally cater to semi-comic book fans and people that want to shove popcorn in their mouths. This film rewards you for really noticing the details while still having massive explosions. One of my favorites is how Lex has all of Batman's branded killed which is why he isn't afraid of the branding at the end or Grandma's Peach Tea as a way of scaring the s*** out of someone. Of course, this film isn't perfect and I do have personal dislikes. The Batman V Superman fight was slow and pretty boring especially after watching such an amazing fight in Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 2 (If you haven't watched the animated Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 1 and 2 you are sorely missing out on something fantastic). Also, the addition of Wonder Woman who pretty much steals a hacker thing, gives it back and then suits up and fights against a giant monster thing. Not to say I don't like Wonder Woman (She is one of my favorite Superheroes of all time who showed not only can woman kick a** but they also don't need to be ashamed of their sexuality or gender) but she wasn't really that helpful to the plot and just brought in to expand the universe which was well done through Lex's superhuman hunting files. Also, the post-apocalyptic scene that was just a dream could have been cut but nothing is perfect except movies like Citizen Kane which isn't a lot of fun to watch cause it is too perfect. So to summarize, the theatrical cut is bad, the ultimate cut is Amazing and the other cut is meh. Please give it a second chance because it deserves it and save a good director from losing grace because of something he didn't do."
"I really liked it, don't know what all the hate is about. I'm actually a Marvel fan from when I was 7 or so, but Superman and Batman together in 1 movie? Just great. And personally I like Ben Affleck even better than Christian Bale as Batman. So just watch and enjoy, I know I did!"

"That's right. We have been waiting for these two heroes to finally meet and fight against each other. This movie is so good in both plot and special effects.Henry Cavill and Ben Affleck have performed well in their acting stages. They are the best superhero actors and they have filmed their fighting scenes very well. The movie starts to show the conflict between the lives of the heroes and now they have blamed each other for it. This movie is amazing and sets up a good plot for Dawn Justice."

"Actually...I didn't know what to expect. When you see Wonder Woman, you know it will be off of Wonder Woman and off of a Wonder Woman story, but with Batman V Superman, I was like, \"hmmmm, so who is this about?\" It was pretty obvious that it would feature many characters, but I thought the introduction to Batman was amazing. Ben Affleck nailed the part, not only as Batman but also as Bruce Wayne. He is my Batman. Henry Cavill continued to be super as the Man of Steel. And he is my Super - Man. A dark story? Yes, without a doubt. Could it have had a few more jokes? Sure. But not all movies or stories need to have jokes when certain events are serious. I really hope people can see this review and take another look at the movie, because, I loved it. I really hope the ratings can go up, eventually. And P.S, this movie is the perfect set up to Justice League."

"I'll start by making it clear I have only ever seen the Ultimate Edition. I'm aware of what was cut out for the theatrical release, so I will concede up front that most of the criticisms about pacing, editing, and missing bits of plot at release were merited.With that caveat out of the way, I must reiterate that this was bar-none the boldest superhero movie I have ever seen. To me, it was arguably the best as well, though \"best\" shouldn't be taken to mean \"most enjoyable.\" That honor easily goes to \"Thor: Ragnarok.\" What makes BvS stand out among other films in the genre is that it takes two characters who have been done to death since the 1970s and brings them up to date. I recently tried to watch \"Superman: The Movie\" for the first time in a number of years, and while it was still good and Reeves will always be iconic, I just couldn't take it seriously. I'll put it this way: If the story in BvS was \"stupid\" in your view but Superman turning back time by spinning the earth backward on its axis didn't seem like one of the dumbest things you have ever seen -in any movie from any genre- to the extent that it outright ruins the movie for you, then your opinion about BvS isn't worth much. Nostalgic bias was always going to be a problem for this movie, and the way people reacted to and reviewed \"Man of Steel\" was telling in this regard.That brings me to Zack Snyder's take on Superman. You know, that guy whose status as the first extraterrestrial ever encountered by humanity was a total non-issue in the old movies. Apparently, Snyder has a similar view to my own in that his take on the Man of Steel makes his being an alien a core piece of his identity. He may look like any other (absurdly attractive) person, but he knows what he is, and that makes him perpetually uncertain of where he fits in this world. He is essentially good and really does care about people, but he struggles to truly empathize with the likes of us. To be human is to be frail, and that is not something he can easily relate to. This is the root of his conflict with Batman.Just as Clark struggles to genuinely relate to most people, Snyder's Batman either refuses to or otherwise just can't relate to Superman. He doesn't see him as anything but a threat regardless of Superman's clear good intentions. Remember, a small group of Kryptonians were able to bring humanity to the brink of extinction in less than a day, and Bruce Wayne is nothing if not a realist. He didn't know the guy from Kansas. He only knew the god from another world.While Batman's anger toward and fear of Superman are readily apparent from the start, Superman's inability to imagine things from Bruce Wayne's perspective only becomes truly apparent during their first real interaction. This reminded me of the animated version of the \"world's finest\" storyline, where Superman judges Batman harshly for using fear tactics and threats of violence (also, actual violence) to get the job done. Superman wasn't willing to consider what it would take for a human man to fight criminals and save innocents, or what that life would do to him over time. Just as Batman didn't see the guy from Kansas, Superman didn't see the man who lives his life trapped in one brutal, unthinkably traumatic moment (this was beautifully conveyed during the film's opening moments), and had spent his whole adult life bearing witness to humanity at its absolute worst.The conflict between these two characters is as old as human history. They want the same things, but they can't understand one another. So they fight. And what a fight it was.Watching a fight between, say, Captain America and Iron Man was, to me, more frustrating than anything because each understood the other's perspective perfectly. The fight between Batman and Superman in BvS was genuinely gut-wrenching, as intended, because they would have understood one another if either had tried. The whole sequence hilighted Batman's tactical prowess and ability to control a situation. Maybe the most badass thing about the fight was that it ended exactly where Batman planned. That brings me to the big elephant in the room named \"Martha.\"I can't recall exactly which YouTuber put it this way, but if you thought the \"save Martha\" exchange was about their mothers having the same name, you had your brain turned off. The brain-on people have explained this to death, but it bears repeating. This was the moment when Superman became humanized to Batman. He was about to die, and his only concern was for his adoptive human mother. He still believed that the man about to take his life would do the right thing. Even with the cowl on, there was no mistaking the look on Batman's face. It was the look of shame, guilt, and sudden uncertainty that says \"What am I doing?\" Turns out even the most brutal, angry version of Bruce Wayne is better than Tony Stark at knowing right from wrong. At knowing that he had gone too far.From there, the third act was a series of truly impressive (albeit mostly CGI) fight sequences, beginning with what I regard as the undisputed champion of Batman fights. Nothing in the Nolan movies (and especially nothing in the Burton movies) even came close. Go ahead, try to convince yourself that Batman and Bane taking turns punching one another in the face until Bane's mask broke was a good fight sequence. No, this was a fight straight out of \"Arkham Knight,\" and it was glorious. The battle against Doomsday really was one for the books. From the moment Wonder Woman arrived accompanied by the intense sounds of Tina Guo's electric cello to Superman's tragic, heroic death at the hands of Doomsday, I was glued to the screen. Sure, the mere presence of Doomsday spoiled the end to a degree, but watching the Man of Steel laboring to carry that kryptonite spear towards certain death was no less impactful. A brief word on Jesse Eisenberg's take on Lex Luthor. At least one other reviewer on this site already said it best when they pointed out that this was his origin story. If you consider his scheme objectively, he is actually one of the more formidable incarnations of the character. If we're lucky, we'll eventually get to see a Snyder Cut of \"Justice League\" and find out where this story was actually meant to go. For the record, Joss Whedon and Danny Elfman both should have said \"no\" to taking a dump on someone else's art."
"BATMAN V SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE brings a fantastic surprise to a smash-hit team-up with one of the worlds most beloved DC Comics' icons of all time. The movie delivers spectacular casting, and fantastic acting with different characters having their shine in each scenes.The story follows Clark Kent/Superman who becomes a threat, after the destruction in Metropolis in Man Of Steel.(2013). Batman/Bruce Wayne sees him as a threat and begins his war on Superman.The movie brings spectacular storytelling, it tells the complications of human against alien who are on the same side, and the first meeting of Batman and Superman. The story of Bruce Wayne, with his many years of The Caped Crusader, sends him on a spiral of \"out of control\", sheer anger, and builds tension to wanting to defeat the Man of Steel. Snyder has fantastically gave this storytelling an exciting nod to the comics.Lex Luthor, played by Jesse Einsberg, delivers a very interesting performance, but very differently by him showing is his \"origin\" before he becomes a bald foe to the Man of Steel. He shows that his love of \"god vs man\" terrorises mankind when he ultimately creates Doomsday, and Batman realises Superman's inner heroism.It packs so many great \"out of nowhere\" excitement, including a first-look of the fearful Wonder Woman a.k.a. Diana Prince, played by Gal Gadot, and a fresh-new glimpse of the superhero DC canon: The Justice League.WATCH THIS MOVIE! The critics are out of their mind. It's a fun-packed action adventure which still keeps the movie enjoyable until it's final minutes of the movie. It's a FANTASTIC MOVIE! BEN AFFLECK AS BATMAN... is Incredible!A 10/10 overall!"
"I want to go on record as saying that this is a truly thrilling cinematic experience in so many ways. If pressed, I guess I could acknowledge that there were a couple ... let's say \"clumsy\" moments. And in a film that runs to three hours, that hardly seems like a significant issue, certainly not enough to rate it with fewer than 9 stars.This film has everything. There is dramatic tension right from the start. There is a magnificent story arc that picks up quite seamlessly from 'Man of Steel' and propels the viewer not only into the life of Clark Kent/Superman but also of Bruce Wayne/Batman.The villain is no mere cartoon of a villain; he is truly thoroughly (and apparently irrevocably) diabolical. He is a psychopath, and you wish for his death over and over and over. You want Superman to reduce him to ash with the power of his eyes.I have read a number of viewers' reviews, and it seems that the people who disliked the film / gave it a low rating had rather unfair and unrealistic expectations of it. That is, their own prejudices about how the plot could/should unfold or what the character development could/should be, etc. ruined the film for them. And that is a shame.My thought is: I settle into my seat, wait for the lights to dim, and then I wait to be transported by the film. I accept it, lock, stock, and barrel.As another reviewer remarked, I love how the film begins from the point of view of Bruce Wayne as he is among people on the ground who have fallen victim to the attack of Zod and the other Kryptonians.Why would Bruce Wayne not like Superman? Why would the good people of Earth hurl insults at Superman and burn him in effigy (on the news)? Because the good people of Earth just got catapulted into a new reality in which there are not only extraterrestrial beings (surprise!) but they are also superman! And a group of them are hell-bent on destroying humankind and taking the planet for themselves.It is difficult to see Superman as separate from the whole Kryptonian Krew.It seems that many moviegoers forgot that Bruce Wayne is also human. Sure, he's a hero, but he is flawed.. Just like the rest of us. He is a vigilante, after all.He has let his vigilantism get the better of him. HE is actually the one working outside the boundaries of the law, not Superman. It is the clear head of Alfred that shows us that he has gone into a rather dark place, that he has not seen what is really going on (in Luthor's scheme), and so he chooses to embark on his own scheme scheme to take out the alien invader. He is (allegedly) thinking of the future: if he wipes out the all-powerful alien, then it can't turn on humankind in the future. At least, he convinces himself of that.A philosophical question is raised in the film: should Clark Kent have remained a simple man from Kansas and never have become the Superman? Should he just let people die and let calamities happen? The question is answered for us in the character of Diana Prince/Wonder Woman. She withdrew from mankind (her exact words) and just sat around watching. Watching while people died horrible deaths all around her. So, should Superman have done the same? Do these special beings, these 'metahumans', have some kind of moral imperative to intervene, or should they be allowed to be regular people, too? It seems that humans want it both ways.It seems that humans are saying: \"Don't be a superalien ... except when I and my friends and family are in trouble. Then come save us.\""

"Batman v Superman: Ultimate Edition: If your looking for a quick, cheap thrill then you might not enjoy this film at the time. This movies theatrical version was butchered by WB and in doing so reshaped the story leaving numerous plot holes. So the Ultimate Edition is the full story and the one worth seeing. Watch 'Man of Steel' before seeing this movie. There is much to claw through here, so much so that the audience might easily find themselves exhausted from the overall aggression of the film. However, a lot of the story does work. The action is good, and the emotion feels real most of the time.This film is about Superman trying to become Superman. Trying to help the world, save people, find a place in this world not as an outcast, and yet is looked at has a threat by many. Superman is not from this world, yet He is trying to be human, find a place in this world, be excepted by earths people, and come into his destiny.This film is also about Batman being Batman for 20 years and losing faith in humanity, and fearing Superman, what Superman can do with his powers. Great film, great plot, great visuals. ---Yidioo"
"I didn't see the film in the theaters and just bought the \"Extended Edition \" on Amazon. I never properly saw Man of Steel- i think I rented it and watched it when already exhausted and fell asleep. I saw the mediocre user reviews and horrible reviews from critics of this film.They really have it wrong. This is the very best either Batman or Superman. It has a different take, on things. Much darker then earlier films even darker then the Christopher Nolan Batman films.First of all Christopher Nolan is an Executive Producer. So how bad could it be? I loved Sucker Punch and Zack Snyder was involved with that. So how bad could this be? Hans Zimmer did the music, so how bad could it be?I remember watching the old Superman TV shows and reading the Superman and Batman comics as a little kid and loved them, but i wouldn't call myself a \"fan boy\" of comic universes, like so many younger people today. As an older adult I will admit my favorite TV show of all time was Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but watched it on DVD only after it had finished. I saw the second of the Dark Knight series in the theater, but the other two, I watched on DVD. They were great, but not my favorite films like so many people. i also loved the first couple Superman and Batman films in the older series. Regardless, i was not waiting with baited breath to see Man of Steel or this one.I'm more of a serious film fan, who can watch Stanley Kubrick films over and over and my favorite films in the last twenty years, are Eyes Wide Shut and Intersteller, both of which i've watched multiple times.So, with that said, take it from me, the critics have this film very wrong, just as critics hated 2001: A Space Odyssey when it first came out. This film will have lasting appreciation.Surprised how much I liked Ben Afleck's Batman. it was hard to get into Henry Cavil's scrawnier looking Superman, but it grew on me. Amy Adams was great as Lois Lane, The Gal Gadol Wonder Women was amazing. Lex Luther was terrific, like Nolan's Joker. Jeremy Irons was the best Alfred ever. Holly Hunter and Diane Lane was good too. The movie had bad reviews but made a billion dollars. Hopefully everyone buys the Ultimate Edition and it breaks sales records and the film is re-appreciated. I have no idea what scenes this Ultimate Edition added, but it is pretty perfect. Now I can't wait for Wonder Woman and the Justice League and as soon as I finish writing this am going to watch Man of Steal. I'm into it now!I can only surmise that the bad reviews stem from too much expectations of the rigid fan boy types and the radical changes in tone, we see in this film.Total masterpiece of cinema, but I have a few criticisms. There are a few hollow scenes of typical Idiot cops and authorities getting everything wrong in a cliché type way and it has a few filler scenes of that type and a few moments here and there that felt rushed and cheesy. Maybe not everything restored into the Ultimate Edition should have been. I wish there had been more Kevin Costner scenes."

"The whole entire Batman V Superman movie was great and yes even though it felt slow to the majority of the people who watched it but to me I enjoyed every part and every scene of Batman V Superman and when it got to the fight scenes both batman VS Superman and the Doomsday fight it brought so much drama, intensity, and epic performances. So with that being said I give this movie a good 10/10 because it really did go to my expectations and it brought a powerful performance and a powerful yet epic introduction to the upcoming Justice League."

"Zack Snyder not only understands the characters but he also understands how to craft a real amazing movie for fans - honestly blew me away (extended cut) Brilliant!Don't believe what the internet is telling you to think - take this from a person who has worked in the comic book industry - this is amazing!"

"When I first wrote a review for this movie a year ago exclaiming my excitement for the film, I had been high off a fresh dose of live-action DC superheroes playing out the beloved comic book stories that I had grown up on. It was all playing out before my eyes and coming to life. After a few months had passed, I began to notice things about the movie that I disliked: little gaps in the story, things that didn't add up, etc. My original rating of a 10 / 10 dropped to an 8 /10. But today it has gone back up to a 10. The extended version of the film not only rectifies the gaps but also silences critics.Many claimed that the movie was too dark or that it just didn't make sense. To those people, I say: \"Pick up a comic book!\" Many of the critics of this particular film were part of the superhero bandwagon that formed when Marvel began its spree of Avengers-related films. In fact, its estimated that over 60% of people who go to see 'superhero' genre films have never picked up a comic book in their life. I would argue that similar numbers could figure to those which view the CW televised DC Universe shows. People complain that DC comics is just too dark but the fact is that these movies are based upon actual comics which are meant to be dark (ex: The Dark Knight Returns, Injustice, etc.). Its like complaining that Game of Thrones (the TV series) sucks because they kill off too many characters. Read the books! Its frustrating to see such a beautiful work of art like Batman V Superman criticized by those ignorant to its universe and its meaning. This movie is in fact a catalyst that opens numerous doorways and leaves true fans in awe of the possibilities for future movies. But regardless of whether or not people choose to educate themselves, this film's DVD/Blu-ray extended version puts the theater release to shame. All of the plot holes and gaps are filled in 30 minutes of extended footage scattered throughout the film. The movie ultimately becomes more complete and people will wish that the movie had shown the full 3 hours of footage in its theatrical debut. As a major DC comics fan, I will of course pick up on things that a comics fan would not, but someone who does not read comics would learn to appreciate this film in its entirety with the extended version. Get your hands on a copy today or find it on Netflix or the internet somewhere!"

"I ignored the bad reviews and watched anyways. This film had a lot to live up to after Civil War was released and I went into this film expecting the worst. It ended up to be the best Superhero film of 2016 to me. One complaint was that this film was more concerned about universe building than telling a great story than Civil War but for me it was the other way around; Civil War felt like a build up to something else and to be honest, I felt that way when I saw the other MCU films. Batman vs Superman however not only had a great story, but it also felt a lot more consistent than Civil War. This film was way more diverse with the cast than the MCU but unlike the MCU, I felt like this film doesn't go overboard with the SJW stuff like the MCU films or The Star Wars Sequel films do. The Visuals were AMAZING, The Score by Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL was AMAZING as well, The Tone is just right as I actually felt for the characters emotionally, The Cinematography kept my eyes glued to the screen, and the script felt really Intelligent and Complex and despite people calling the writing confusing, I was able to piece it together with no problem whatsoever. This film is similar to Empire Strikes back in terms of popularity so over time after the other movies are released, this movie would probably be more popular.This film was way better than I Expected and deserves another chance.

"Its shame to see what critics and marvel fans did to this movie and targeted Zack Snyder for it. I have seen this movie more than 25 times till date. And i enjoy this movie as much as i enjoyed the first time. The fans who have read DC comics, wouldn't be disappointed in this movie. Its dark movie, yes it is. Because the title shows the intense situation at hand. Two superheroes about to rip each other apart for whatever reasons that brought them to this stage. Yes it had to be dark and intense.Only marvel can be stupid enough to show an alien invasion where humans are loosing the battle and the super heroes are cracking jokes while battles as if they are playing ping pong. a person playing Call of Duty game is more serious while playing than the marvel heroes fighting aliens."

"Last week some news came out from somebody online who had claimed to have seen a finished version of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. If you were like me, you've been leery of checking it out because you weren't sure how much might actually be true. Now Zack Snyder has spoken out about the spoiler-filled post, although his response doesn't really clear anything up.In a word, to MTV, he called the post \"hilarious,which might imply that he's saying that it's mostly, if not entirely, untrue. That might be the case, but then again he could have just said it was untrue and he didn't say that. What he did say, however, is that he doesn't like spoilers. While this may seem odd for the director who's most recent trailer appeared to give away the entire movie, Snyder says that's not the case. Even if you've seen the trailer, you can rest easy, as there is much more we have not seen in then finished film. Says Snyder I have the benefit of seeing the movie. It's cool that think it's too much, and I appreciate people not wanting to know, but there's plenty that they don't know. There's a lot of movie that's not in the trailer. In the process of calling the Batman v Superman Reddit review hilarious, Snyder goes on to talk about how he hates it when spoilers come out. The director would much rather that fans see the movie mostly blind. While he understands that some fans may wish to find the answers before hand, he wants his movies to be mysteries going in. If you're, as an audience member, exploring these articles, looking for answers to questions that you have, maybe you're okay with knowing before you go. It's like an individual taste. But like I said, I want people to see the movie without knowing.Spoilers are a topic that mean different things to different people. While most try to avoid them to some degree, the need to solve the mystery is a nearly universal human experience. We have an inclination to want to know the truth, even while also wanting to be surprised. For most of us getting some information is good, but getting all the information is bad, of course, only getting the details that you want can be difficult."
"The theatrical is choppy, poorly edited, hard to follow, with some really good moments mixed in their. The extended is much more fluent and is much easier to follow, it does have a long runtime, which might make it seem a bit dragging on, but if you like long films done right, like Lord of the Rings, you will like this movie as long as you get into the characters and story. Speaking of which, the story starts out perfectly showing Bruce Wayne as a character, and it is very powerful. There are several moments in this movie that are powerful, emotional, and shocking. Characters. Batman is my favorite fictional character of all time, and believe me when I say, Ben Affleck as Batman was perfect, he had the charisma, the anger, and the look of being through some bad stuff Gal Gadot also does perfect as Wonder Woman, but if you want to really see how good she does, go watch the Wonder Woman movie. Henry Call as Superman. I really don't like it when people say Christopher Reeves is better. Don't get me wrong, Reeves does great, but can you imagine him as Superman in this movie? I wouldn't like it. It would be like Adam West playing Batman in The Dark Knight. Henry Cavill does great in this role, I can say everything about him as I said with Ben Affleck. Jesse Eisenberg as Luthor. I thought it was different in a good way. I've heard a criticism for him as being too much like Joker, but is that a bad thing? Joker is my favorite villain, so to see Superman have an enemy that crazy, but still hold the values Luthor needs to be Luthor, I think it is great. The thing I thought this movie was lacking in the first and second acts was humor, at least good humor. If there was more humor, I would've given this movie a ten because it would give a more relaxing feel to the parts that needed it. All in all though, this movie was awesome, it had powerful moments, it was badass, and just plain fun. It had a great story arc and does its job very well."

"*I will be talking about the Ultimate Edition of the film* This was one of the most anticipated CBM of all time. Ever since the arrival and subsequent success of Marvel's The Avengers people have wondered when will DC launch its own cinematic universe, one of the main reasons being the opportunity to finally see titans such as Batman and Superman share the screen together: the ultimate nerd dream. On 2016, the moment finally came for BvS to be released AND.. it performed poorly. Not only did critical reception left a lot to be desired, but fan reactions where surprisingly split after its cinematic debut. People either loved it and called Zack a genius, or hated it and called him a hack. Me, personally, I found myself with middle of the road feelings, for sure, but more leaning towards the negative side with subsequent viewings. The theatrical cut of the film showcased amazing performances, incredible visuals, and action set pieces that seemed like comic book panels come to life, in a good way. However, when it comes to its narrative structure and more technical aspects like editing, the film was seriously flawed. More plot holes than Age of Ultron, questionable character decisions, random editing that lacked cohesion and focus, and forced dramatic moments that lacked any impact because the attempts at character development ranged from limited to nonexistent, especially when it comes to Superman's character. I thought it was a 5/10 movie at best. As such, I was kind of skeptical about the idea of a 30 minute longer version. I say kind of because I know how Zack works. I remember Watchmen being vastly improved with its director's cut, so in a way I was expecting BvS to perform in a similar manner, but I also feared those 30 minutes wold be just there to amplify action and discredit storytelling issues. Oh boy, I'm so glad I was proved wrong. The ultimate cut of the film was infuriating, but not because it was awful, but because it questions the sanity of WB executives and editors and makes you wonder what were they thinking during the editing process. What I got out of the Ultimate Edition was a thought-provoking deconstruction of two very iconic superheroes that gave spotlight to the struggles both of them face when they aren't fighting crime. What I got was an extremely well produced character study on both Batman and Superman in a cynical world, a world dangerously close to our own. We meet Batman as a ruthless, worn out hero that has seen the failure behind his ideals and witnessed some truly horrifying things in his life. Superman, on the other hand, is portrayed as a godlike figure that seeks to do good in the world, but finds himself emotionally conflicted once he realized that every good deed he does leaves behind a trail of destruction (most of it due to Luthor's antics). In my opinion, this is a hugely original approach, one that distances itself from the rest of the competition and delivers a dark, somber, yet relevant superhero movie that understands both characters and gives them real human struggles to deal with. I felt invested in both of them, and hoped that by the end of the film both could find a way to redeem themselves. Their character arcs were very well established during the first two acts of the movie, and by the time we get to the titular climactic battle the emotion behind the jaw-dropping action is intensified. Lex Luthor as a villain was also given more time to develop with this new edition. One of the main criticisms with the original version was the fact that his plan relied too much on conveniences, and the character's mannerisms and mad-scientist attitude was annoying, and that goes without saying his motivations were unclear. Not only do we spend more time understanding his hate for any godlike figure and thus his hatred for Superman, but the added scenes allowed us to witness his entire plan come to fruition. It sells the cold, manipulative, calculating attributes of his comic counterpart. The acting is spot on. Every actor owns his/her role, from Cavill's Superman, to Ben Affleck as Batman, Eisenberg as Luthor, and Gadot as Wonder Woman, whose scenes are brief, but are more than enough to sell the strong and ferocious warrior that she is. Cinematography is stunning, and miles above that of Man of Steel's. And the soundtrack by Zimmer and Junkie XL? Perfect, just perfect. When it comes to flaws, the film still has some of those. The Martha moment, while serving as a pivotal character moment for Batman, felt off in execution, and its understandable that many people got mad at it. If your main complaint about BvS the first time around was its bleak tone and subject matter, this film is still not for you. I understand most were expecting to see the heroes being the most iconic versions of themselves, clashing in an elongated battle and evoking the same feelings The Avengers gave audiences back in 2012. In that sense, the film will remain divisive, but at least I have the comfort of saying that, at the very least, the film is competently made."

"This film was amazing. Ben Affleck was easily the best part of this movie, he brought his a-game as Batman. The chemistry between Affleck & Irons was outstanding. Gal Gadot did a great job as Wonder Woman. The fight between Batman & Superman was awesome. The final fight with Doomsday was outstanding in every way possible. However, there is only one problem with this film and that's Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor. He was sadly missed cast in this role, but then again it's really the fault of Warner Bros. Studios. Overall, this film deliver on almost every level. I highly recommend that you watch the extended version of this film."

"I know I know. I saw it in theaters too, and felt like it could've been so much better. While the Batman element was good, the narrative felt fractured, and the third act was just one long stunt scene. Superman was relegated to a supporting character, and other characters didn't get a chance to shine. And then I chanced on the ultimate cut. Calling it 30 mins of \"extra\" footage is unfair to Zack Snyder because it's exactly these 30 mins that makes the movie a worthy one. What I can say about the theatrical cut is this - It had the blockbuster elements - music, visuals, stunts, CGI. But, it lacked the human elements. The first 20 mins of the movie had it, but not after that. The extended cut in comparison has a flow to the narrative. There are no disjointed scenes, everything flows smoothly, and there's connective tissue. Superman gets to spend some time with his father, and mother. Clark Kent does some investigative journalism. Superman helps the people after the blast. Lois Lane doesn't jump to conclusions, she gets to the bottom of the crime. Lex Luthor apparently had a coherent plan - everything is explained pretty well. Wonder Woman was already good, so there's no change there :) Also, the \"Martha\" scene seems better executed, because it is a few seconds longer, and there's time to breathe it in. So, here's my take on this movie - The theatrical cut was junk. Get the Bluray for ultimate edition, and you shall not be disappointed. I've seen it so many more times now, and it's the definitive cut. It is the movie we deserve. It's a unique take on Batman, and Superman. It's a gritty take on the superhero movie genre, and definitely the best DCEU movie, and the best DC movie since The Dark Knight.P.S. Yes it's dark. We're adults, and we should appreciate mature film making without intentionally silly moments. It attempts to be philosophical, and something deep instead of just trying to make you chuckle."

"This is one of the best superhero movies ever made. Zack Snyder is a magician behind the camera.The reason behind so many complaints is the fact that Warner Bros. marketed this movie as a fight between Batman and Superman. That's not what it is. It's a movie about the origins of the Justice League.The cinematography, the acting and the score are all second to none. This film is phenomenal.P.S: watch the 3 hour extended cut that Snyder intended you to see, not the 2 and a half hour movie that Warner Bros. decided would be better for theaters."

"I don't care what the critics say, this is a very well-done movie. I'll start my review by listing what I like about the movie.1.) Ben Affleck is the best batman to me and it is not close. He pulls off the role of an aging batman extremely well. Also, Zack Snyder's vision of batman is legit. I have always hated batman up until this adaptation of him. Instead of being a conflicted and idealistic batman, this batman is dark, gritty, and 100% a badass. His equipment is decked out with machine guns and he has no aversion to killing people. In fact, he probably kills about 50 criminal by the time this movie is over. The warehouse scene is the coolest batman scene in any movie.2.) The development of a grudge between batman and superman is pulled off flawlessly. It actually makes sense why batman dislikes superman. Then, when they do fight it is about the coolest thing you can expect to see from a superhero film. 3.) I disagree with a lot of people about Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor. In my opinion, he played his role to perfection. 4.) B v S sets up Wonder Woman and Justice League with Gal Gadot's cameo as Wonder Woman and short clips of Aquaman, the Flash, and Cyborg. B v S is one of my favorite superhero films and rewatching it never gets old."

"The theatrical cut of this film is garbage which is why I rated it eight stars instead of nine. The first time I watched this film I didn't like it (not straight out hate but didn't like). Character motivations didn't make any sense, Lex was annoying as s***, editing was sloppy, and it was overly dark and broody for an action superhero movie. A year + a half, five Marvel films, a ton of bad reviews and a Justice League later a thought popped into my head: \"what if I watched BVS again\". This time I didn't have trailers ruining the best moments, I only vaguely remembered the film, and I was conditioned to look at it negatively but something unexpected happened: I actually loved it. Superman was just a normal person that tried to make a difference cause he could that others imposed their own beliefs on. Lex Luthor was a genius that couldn't stand his powerlessness compared to Superman or more accurately a super being. As Alfred said \"The fever, the rage, the feeling of powerlessness that turns good men... cruel\" and you see the same thought process in Batman. Batman, just like Lex Luthor feels powerless in the midst of a god-being and just like Lex he attempts to destroy him so he can get his sense of power back but unlike Lex, Batman learns something. I what is one of the corniest lines of the movie Superman says, \"Martha\" when he knows he can't win against Batman in a late desperate attempt to save his mother. Not only does this name connect with Bruce Wayne but it also shows what really matters to a man of steel: it isn't power, it isn't fame or anything else, it is his Mother and on a broader scale it is people. Lex (who doesn't care about people at all) knows he doesn't have the power so he creates something from his blood and the remains of Zod: A Doomsday for Superman. Not only does this film have depth but it also doesn't always explain it to you which is rare in a blockbuster action superhero flick normally cater to semi-comic book fans and people that want to shove popcorn in their mouths. This film rewards you for really noticing the details while still having massive explosions. One of my favorites is how Lex has all of Batman's branded killed which is why he isn't afraid of the branding at the end or Grandma's Peach Tea as a way of scaring the s*** out of someone. Of course, this film isn't perfect and I do have personal dislikes. The Batman V Superman fight was slow and pretty boring especially after watching such an amazing fight in Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 2 (If you haven't watched the animated Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 1 and 2 you are sorely missing out on something fantastic). Also, the addition of Wonder Woman who pretty much steals a hacker thing, gives it back and then suits up and fights against a giant monster thing. Not to say I don't like Wonder Woman (She is one of my favorite Superheroes of all time who showed not only can woman kick a** but they also don't need to be ashamed of their sexuality or gender) but she wasn't really that helpful to the plot and just brought in to expand the universe which was well done through Lex's superhuman hunting files. Also, the post-apocalyptic scene that was just a dream could have been cut but nothing is perfect except movies like Citizen Kane which isn't a lot of fun to watch cause it is too perfect. So to summarize, the theatrical cut is bad, the ultimate cut is Amazing and the other cut is meh. Please give it a second chance because it deserves it and save a good director from losing grace because of something he didn't do."
"I really liked it, don't know what all the hate is about. I'm actually a Marvel fan from when I was 7 or so, but Superman and Batman together in 1 movie? Just great. And personally I like Ben Affleck even better than Christian Bale as Batman. So just watch and enjoy, I know I did!"

"That's right. We have been waiting for these two heroes to finally meet and fight against each other. This movie is so good in both plot and special effects.Henry Cavill and Ben Affleck have performed well in their acting stages. They are the best superhero actors and they have filmed their fighting scenes very well. The movie starts to show the conflict between the lives of the heroes and now they have blamed each other for it. This movie is amazing and sets up a good plot for Dawn Justice."

"Actually...I didn't know what to expect. When you see Wonder Woman, you know it will be off of Wonder Woman and off of a Wonder Woman story, but with Batman V Superman, I was like, \"hmmmm, so who is this about?\" It was pretty obvious that it would feature many characters, but I thought the introduction to Batman was amazing. Ben Affleck nailed the part, not only as Batman but also as Bruce Wayne. He is my Batman. Henry Cavill continued to be super as the Man of Steel. And he is my Super - Man. A dark story? Yes, without a doubt. Could it have had a few more jokes? Sure. But not all movies or stories need to have jokes when certain events are serious. I really hope people can see this review and take another look at the movie, because, I loved it. I really hope the ratings can go up, eventually. And P.S, this movie is the perfect set up to Justice League."

"This film is crucial to the extended universe that DC is trying to build, but it feels highly derivative of better stories and continues to demonstrate the misuse of the iconic characters mentioned in the title. Plus Jesse Eisenberg feels wildly mis-casted."

"I'll start by making it clear I have only ever seen the Ultimate Edition. I'm aware of what was cut out for the theatrical release, so I will concede up front that most of the criticisms about pacing, editing, and missing bits of plot at release were merited.With that caveat out of the way, I must reiterate that this was bar-none the boldest superhero movie I have ever seen. To me, it was arguably the best as well, though \"best\" shouldn't be taken to mean \"most enjoyable.\" That honor easily goes to \"Thor: Ragnarok.\" What makes BvS stand out among other films in the genre is that it takes two characters who have been done to death since the 1970s and brings them up to date. I recently tried to watch \"Superman: The Movie\" for the first time in a number of years, and while it was still good and Reeves will always be iconic, I just couldn't take it seriously. I'll put it this way: If the story in BvS was \"stupid\" in your view but Superman turning back time by spinning the earth backward on its axis didn't seem like one of the dumbest things you have ever seen -in any movie from any genre- to the extent that it outright ruins the movie for you, then your opinion about BvS isn't worth much. Nostalgic bias was always going to be a problem for this movie, and the way people reacted to and reviewed \"Man of Steel\" was telling in this regard.That brings me to Zack Snyder's take on Superman. You know, that guy whose status as the first extraterrestrial ever encountered by humanity was a total non-issue in the old movies. Apparently, Snyder has a similar view to my own in that his take on the Man of Steel makes his being an alien a core piece of his identity. He may look like any other (absurdly attractive) person, but he knows what he is, and that makes him perpetually uncertain of where he fits in this world. He is essentially good and really does care about people, but he struggles to truly empathize with the likes of us. To be human is to be frail, and that is not something he can easily relate to. This is the root of his conflict with Batman.Just as Clark struggles to genuinely relate to most people, Snyder's Batman either refuses to or otherwise just can't relate to Superman. He doesn't see him as anything but a threat regardless of Superman's clear good intentions. Remember, a small group of Kryptonians were able to bring humanity to the brink of extinction in less than a day, and Bruce Wayne is nothing if not a realist. He didn't know the guy from Kansas. He only knew the god from another world.While Batman's anger toward and fear of Superman are readily apparent from the start, Superman's inability to imagine things from Bruce Wayne's perspective only becomes truly apparent during their first real interaction. This reminded me of the animated version of the \"world's finest\" storyline, where Superman judges Batman harshly for using fear tactics and threats of violence (also, actual violence) to get the job done. Superman wasn't willing to consider what it would take for a human man to fight criminals and save innocents, or what that life would do to him over time. Just as Batman didn't see the guy from Kansas, Superman didn't see the man who lives his life trapped in one brutal, unthinkably traumatic moment (this was beautifully conveyed during the film's opening moments), and had spent his whole adult life bearing witness to humanity at its absolute worst.The conflict between these two characters is as old as human history. They want the same things, but they can't understand one another. So they fight. And what a fight it was.Watching a fight between, say, Captain America and Iron Man was, to me, more frustrating than anything because each understood the other's perspective perfectly. The fight between Batman and Superman in BvS was genuinely gut-wrenching, as intended, because they would have understood one another if either had tried. The whole sequence hilighted Batman's tactical prowess and ability to control a situation. Maybe the most badass thing about the fight was that it ended exactly where Batman planned. That brings me to the big elephant in the room named \"Martha.\"I can't recall exactly which YouTuber put it this way, but if you thought the \"save Martha\" exchange was about their mothers having the same name, you had your brain turned off. The brain-on people have explained this to death, but it bears repeating. This was the moment when Superman became humanized to Batman. He was about to die, and his only concern was for his adoptive human mother. He still believed that the man about to take his life would do the right thing. Even with the cowl on, there was no mistaking the look on Batman's face. It was the look of shame, guilt, and sudden uncertainty that says \"What am I doing?\" Turns out even the most brutal, angry version of Bruce Wayne is better than Tony Stark at knowing right from wrong. At knowing that he had gone too far.From there, the third act was a series of truly impressive (albeit mostly CGI) fight sequences, beginning with what I regard as the undisputed champion of Batman fights. Nothing in the Nolan movies (and especially nothing in the Burton movies) even came close. Go ahead, try to convince yourself that Batman and Bane taking turns punching one another in the face until Bane's mask broke was a good fight sequence. No, this was a fight straight out of \"Arkham Knight,\" and it was glorious. The battle against Doomsday really was one for the books. From the moment Wonder Woman arrived accompanied by the intense sounds of Tina Guo's electric cello to Superman's tragic, heroic death at the hands of Doomsday, I was glued to the screen. Sure, the mere presence of Doomsday spoiled the end to a degree, but watching the Man of Steel laboring to carry that kryptonite spear towards certain death was no less impactful. A brief word on Jesse Eisenberg's take on Lex Luthor. At least one other reviewer on this site already said it best when they pointed out that this was his origin story. If you consider his scheme objectively, he is actually one of the more formidable incarnations of the character. If we're lucky, we'll eventually get to see a Snyder Cut of \"Justice League\" and find out where this story was actually meant to go. For the record, Joss Whedon and Danny Elfman both should have said \"no\" to taking a dump on someone else's art."
"BATMAN V SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE brings a fantastic surprise to a smash-hit team-up with one of the worlds most beloved DC Comics' icons of all time. The movie delivers spectacular casting, and fantastic acting with different characters having their shine in each scenes.The story follows Clark Kent/Superman who becomes a threat, after the destruction in Metropolis in Man Of Steel.(2013). Batman/Bruce Wayne sees him as a threat and begins his war on Superman.The movie brings spectacular storytelling, it tells the complications of human against alien who are on the same side, and the first meeting of Batman and Superman. The story of Bruce Wayne, with his many years of The Caped Crusader, sends him on a spiral of \"out of control\", sheer anger, and builds tension to wanting to defeat the Man of Steel. Snyder has fantastically gave this storytelling an exciting nod to the comics.Lex Luthor, played by Jesse Einsberg, delivers a very interesting performance, but very differently by him showing is his \"origin\" before he becomes a bald foe to the Man of Steel. He shows that his love of \"god vs man\" terrorises mankind when he ultimately creates Doomsday, and Batman realises Superman's inner heroism.It packs so many great \"out of nowhere\" excitement, including a first-look of the fearful Wonder Woman a.k.a. Diana Prince, played by Gal Gadot, and a fresh-new glimpse of the superhero DC canon: The Justice League.WATCH THIS MOVIE! The critics are out of their mind. It's a fun-packed action adventure which still keeps the movie enjoyable until it's final minutes of the movie. It's a FANTASTIC MOVIE! BEN AFFLECK AS BATMAN... is Incredible!A 10/10 overall!"
"I want to go on record as saying that this is a truly thrilling cinematic experience in so many ways. If pressed, I guess I could acknowledge that there were a couple ... let's say \"clumsy\" moments. And in a film that runs to three hours, that hardly seems like a significant issue, certainly not enough to rate it with fewer than 9 stars.This film has everything. There is dramatic tension right from the start. There is a magnificent story arc that picks up quite seamlessly from 'Man of Steel' and propels the viewer not only into the life of Clark Kent/Superman but also of Bruce Wayne/Batman.The villain is no mere cartoon of a villain; he is truly thoroughly (and apparently irrevocably) diabolical. He is a psychopath, and you wish for his death over and over and over. You want Superman to reduce him to ash with the power of his eyes.I have read a number of viewers' reviews, and it seems that the people who disliked the film / gave it a low rating had rather unfair and unrealistic expectations of it. That is, their own prejudices about how the plot could/should unfold or what the character development could/should be, etc. ruined the film for them. And that is a shame.My thought is: I settle into my seat, wait for the lights to dim, and then I wait to be transported by the film. I accept it, lock, stock, and barrel.As another reviewer remarked, I love how the film begins from the point of view of Bruce Wayne as he is among people on the ground who have fallen victim to the attack of Zod and the other Kryptonians.Why would Bruce Wayne not like Superman? Why would the good people of Earth hurl insults at Superman and burn him in effigy (on the news)? Because the good people of Earth just got catapulted into a new reality in which there are not only extraterrestrial beings (surprise!) but they are also superman! And a group of them are hell-bent on destroying humankind and taking the planet for themselves.It is difficult to see Superman as separate from the whole Kryptonian Krew.It seems that many moviegoers forgot that Bruce Wayne is also human. Sure, he's a hero, but he is flawed.. Just like the rest of us. He is a vigilante, after all.He has let his vigilantism get the better of him. HE is actually the one working outside the boundaries of the law, not Superman. It is the clear head of Alfred that shows us that he has gone into a rather dark place, that he has not seen what is really going on (in Luthor's scheme), and so he chooses to embark on his own scheme scheme to take out the alien invader. He is (allegedly) thinking of the future: if he wipes out the all-powerful alien, then it can't turn on humankind in the future. At least, he convinces himself of that.A philosophical question is raised in the film: should Clark Kent have remained a simple man from Kansas and never have become the Superman? Should he just let people die and let calamities happen? The question is answered for us in the character of Diana Prince/Wonder Woman. She withdrew from mankind (her exact words) and just sat around watching. Watching while people died horrible deaths all around her. So, should Superman have done the same? Do these special beings, these 'metahumans', have some kind of moral imperative to intervene, or should they be allowed to be regular people, too? It seems that humans want it both ways.It seems that humans are saying: \"Don't be a superalien ... except when I and my friends and family are in trouble. Then come save us.\""

"Batman v Superman: Ultimate Edition: If your looking for a quick, cheap thrill then you might not enjoy this film at the time. This movies theatrical version was butchered by WB and in doing so reshaped the story leaving numerous plot holes. So the Ultimate Edition is the full story and the one worth seeing. Watch 'Man of Steel' before seeing this movie. There is much to claw through here, so much so that the audience might easily find themselves exhausted from the overall aggression of the film. However, a lot of the story does work. The action is good, and the emotion feels real most of the time.This film is about Superman trying to become Superman. Trying to help the world, save people, find a place in this world not as an outcast, and yet is looked at has a threat by many. Superman is not from this world, yet He is trying to be human, find a place in this world, be excepted by earths people, and come into his destiny.This film is also about Batman being Batman for 20 years and losing faith in humanity, and fearing Superman, what Superman can do with his powers. Great film, great plot, great visuals. ---Yidioo"
"I didn't see the film in the theaters and just bought the \"Extended Edition \" on Amazon. I never properly saw Man of Steel- i think I rented it and watched it when already exhausted and fell asleep. I saw the mediocre user reviews and horrible reviews from critics of this film.They really have it wrong. This is the very best either Batman or Superman. It has a different take, on things. Much darker then earlier films even darker then the Christopher Nolan Batman films.First of all Christopher Nolan is an Executive Producer. So how bad could it be? I loved Sucker Punch and Zack Snyder was involved with that. So how bad could this be? Hans Zimmer did the music, so how bad could it be?I remember watching the old Superman TV shows and reading the Superman and Batman comics as a little kid and loved them, but i wouldn't call myself a \"fan boy\" of comic universes, like so many younger people today. As an older adult I will admit my favorite TV show of all time was Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but watched it on DVD only after it had finished. I saw the second of the Dark Knight series in the theater, but the other two, I watched on DVD. They were great, but not my favorite films like so many people. i also loved the first couple Superman and Batman films in the older series. Regardless, i was not waiting with baited breath to see Man of Steel or this one.I'm more of a serious film fan, who can watch Stanley Kubrick films over and over and my favorite films in the last twenty years, are Eyes Wide Shut and Intersteller, both of which i've watched multiple times.So, with that said, take it from me, the critics have this film very wrong, just as critics hated 2001: A Space Odyssey when it first came out. This film will have lasting appreciation.Surprised how much I liked Ben Afleck's Batman. it was hard to get into Henry Cavil's scrawnier looking Superman, but it grew on me. Amy Adams was great as Lois Lane, The Gal Gadol Wonder Women was amazing. Lex Luther was terrific, like Nolan's Joker. Jeremy Irons was the best Alfred ever. Holly Hunter and Diane Lane was good too. The movie had bad reviews but made a billion dollars. Hopefully everyone buys the Ultimate Edition and it breaks sales records and the film is re-appreciated. I have no idea what scenes this Ultimate Edition added, but it is pretty perfect. Now I can't wait for Wonder Woman and the Justice League and as soon as I finish writing this am going to watch Man of Steal. I'm into it now!I can only surmise that the bad reviews stem from too much expectations of the rigid fan boy types and the radical changes in tone, we see in this film.Total masterpiece of cinema, but I have a few criticisms. There are a few hollow scenes of typical Idiot cops and authorities getting everything wrong in a cliché type way and it has a few filler scenes of that type and a few moments here and there that felt rushed and cheesy. Maybe not everything restored into the Ultimate Edition should have been. I wish there had been more Kevin Costner scenes."

"The whole entire Batman V Superman movie was great and yes even though it felt slow to the majority of the people who watched it but to me I enjoyed every part and every scene of Batman V Superman and when it got to the fight scenes both batman VS Superman and the Doomsday fight it brought so much drama, intensity, and epic performances. So with that being said I give this movie a good 10/10 because it really did go to my expectations and it brought a powerful performance and a powerful yet epic introduction to the upcoming Justice League."

"When I first wrote a review for this movie a year ago exclaiming my excitement for the film, I had been high off a fresh dose of live-action DC superheroes playing out the beloved comic book stories that I had grown up on. It was all playing out before my eyes and coming to life. After a few months had passed, I began to notice things about the movie that I disliked: little gaps in the story, things that didn't add up, etc. My original rating of a 10 / 10 dropped to an 8 /10. But today it has gone back up to a 10. The extended version of the film not only rectifies the gaps but also silences critics.Many claimed that the movie was too dark or that it just didn't make sense. To those people, I say: \"Pick up a comic book!\" Many of the critics of this particular film were part of the superhero bandwagon that formed when Marvel began its spree of Avengers-related films. In fact, its estimated that over 60% of people who go to see 'superhero' genre films have never picked up a comic book in their life. I would argue that similar numbers could figure to those which view the CW televised DC Universe shows. People complain that DC comics is just too dark but the fact is that these movies are based upon actual comics which are meant to be dark (ex: The Dark Knight Returns, Injustice, etc.). Its like complaining that Game of Thrones (the TV series) sucks because they kill off too many characters. Read the books! Its frustrating to see such a beautiful work of art like Batman V Superman criticized by those ignorant to its universe and its meaning. This movie is in fact a catalyst that opens numerous doorways and leaves true fans in awe of the possibilities for future movies. But regardless of whether or not people choose to educate themselves, this film's DVD/Blu-ray extended version puts the theater release to shame. All of the plot holes and gaps are filled in 30 minutes of extended footage scattered throughout the film. The movie ultimately becomes more complete and people will wish that the movie had shown the full 3 hours of footage in its theatrical debut. As a major DC comics fan, I will of course pick up on things that a comics fan would not, but someone who does not read comics would learn to appreciate this film in its entirety with the extended version. Get your hands on a copy today or find it on Netflix or the internet somewhere!"

"I ignored the bad reviews and watched anyways. This film had a lot to live up to after Civil War was released and I went into this film expecting the worst. It ended up to be the best Superhero film of 2016 to me. One complaint was that this film was more concerned about universe building than telling a great story than Civil War but for me it was the other way around; Civil War felt like a build up to something else and to be honest, I felt that way when I saw the other MCU films. Batman vs Superman however not only had a great story, but it also felt a lot more consistent than Civil War. This film was way more diverse with the cast than the MCU but unlike the MCU, I felt like this film doesn't go overboard with the SJW stuff like the MCU films or The Star Wars Sequel films do. The Visuals were AMAZING, The Score by Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL was AMAZING as well, The Tone is just right as I actually felt for the characters emotionally, The Cinematography kept my eyes glued to the screen, and the script felt really Intelligent and Complex and despite people calling the writing confusing, I was able to piece it together with no problem whatsoever. This film is similar to Empire Strikes back in terms of popularity so over time after the other movies are released, this movie would probably be more popular.This film was way better than I Expected and deserves another chance.

"Its shame to see what critics and marvel fans did to this movie and targeted Zack Snyder for it. I have seen this movie more than 25 times till date. And i enjoy this movie as much as i enjoyed the first time. The fans who have read DC comics, wouldn't be disappointed in this movie. Its dark movie, yes it is. Because the title shows the intense situation at hand. Two superheroes about to rip each other apart for whatever reasons that brought them to this stage. Yes it had to be dark and intense.Only marvel can be stupid enough to show an alien invasion where humans are loosing the battle and the super heroes are cracking jokes while battles as if they are playing ping pong. a person playing Call of Duty game is more serious while playing than the marvel heroes fighting aliens."

"Last week some news came out from somebody online who had claimed to have seen a finished version of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. If you were like me, you've been leery of checking it out because you weren't sure how much might actually be true. Now Zack Snyder has spoken out about the spoiler-filled post, although his response doesn't really clear anything up.In a word, to MTV, he called the post \"hilarious,which might imply that he's saying that it's mostly, if not entirely, untrue. That might be the case, but then again he could have just said it was untrue and he didn't say that. What he did say, however, is that he doesn't like spoilers. While this may seem odd for the director who's most recent trailer appeared to give away the entire movie, Snyder says that's not the case. Even if you've seen the trailer, you can rest easy, as there is much more we have not seen in then finished film. Says Snyder I have the benefit of seeing the movie. It's cool that think it's too much, and I appreciate people not wanting to know, but there's plenty that they don't know. There's a lot of movie that's not in the trailer. In the process of calling the Batman v Superman Reddit review hilarious, Snyder goes on to talk about how he hates it when spoilers come out. The director would much rather that fans see the movie mostly blind. While he understands that some fans may wish to find the answers before hand, he wants his movies to be mysteries going in. If you're, as an audience member, exploring these articles, looking for answers to questions that you have, maybe you're okay with knowing before you go. It's like an individual taste. But like I said, I want people to see the movie without knowing.Spoilers are a topic that mean different things to different people. While most try to avoid them to some degree, the need to solve the mystery is a nearly universal human experience. We have an inclination to want to know the truth, even while also wanting to be surprised. For most of us getting some information is good, but getting all the information is bad, of course, only getting the details that you want can be difficult."
"The theatrical is choppy, poorly edited, hard to follow, with some really good moments mixed in their. The extended is much more fluent and is much easier to follow, it does have a long runtime, which might make it seem a bit dragging on, but if you like long films done right, like Lord of the Rings, you will like this movie as long as you get into the characters and story. Speaking of which, the story starts out perfectly showing Bruce Wayne as a character, and it is very powerful. There are several moments in this movie that are powerful, emotional, and shocking. Characters. Batman is my favorite fictional character of all time, and believe me when I say, Ben Affleck as Batman was perfect, he had the charisma, the anger, and the look of being through some bad stuff Gal Gadot also does perfect as Wonder Woman, but if you want to really see how good she does, go watch the Wonder Woman movie. Henry Call as Superman. I really don't like it when people say Christopher Reeves is better. Don't get me wrong, Reeves does great, but can you imagine him as Superman in this movie? I wouldn't like it. It would be like Adam West playing Batman in The Dark Knight. Henry Cavill does great in this role, I can say everything about him as I said with Ben Affleck. Jesse Eisenberg as Luthor. I thought it was different in a good way. I've heard a criticism for him as being too much like Joker, but is that a bad thing? Joker is my favorite villain, so to see Superman have an enemy that crazy, but still hold the values Luthor needs to be Luthor, I think it is great. The thing I thought this movie was lacking in the first and second acts was humor, at least good humor. If there was more humor, I would've given this movie a ten because it would give a more relaxing feel to the parts that needed it. All in all though, this movie was awesome, it had powerful moments, it was badass, and just plain fun. It had a great story arc and does its job very well."

"*I will be talking about the Ultimate Edition of the film* This was one of the most anticipated CBM of all time. Ever since the arrival and subsequent success of Marvel's The Avengers people have wondered when will DC launch its own cinematic universe, one of the main reasons being the opportunity to finally see titans such as Batman and Superman share the screen together: the ultimate nerd dream. On 2016, the moment finally came for BvS to be released AND.. it performed poorly. Not only did critical reception left a lot to be desired, but fan reactions where surprisingly split after its cinematic debut. People either loved it and called Zack a genius, or hated it and called him a hack. Me, personally, I found myself with middle of the road feelings, for sure, but more leaning towards the negative side with subsequent viewings. The theatrical cut of the film showcased amazing performances, incredible visuals, and action set pieces that seemed like comic book panels come to life, in a good way. However, when it comes to its narrative structure and more technical aspects like editing, the film was seriously flawed. More plot holes than Age of Ultron, questionable character decisions, random editing that lacked cohesion and focus, and forced dramatic moments that lacked any impact because the attempts at character development ranged from limited to nonexistent, especially when it comes to Superman's character. I thought it was a 5/10 movie at best. As such, I was kind of skeptical about the idea of a 30 minute longer version. I say kind of because I know how Zack works. I remember Watchmen being vastly improved with its director's cut, so in a way I was expecting BvS to perform in a similar manner, but I also feared those 30 minutes wold be just there to amplify action and discredit storytelling issues. Oh boy, I'm so glad I was proved wrong. The ultimate cut of the film was infuriating, but not because it was awful, but because it questions the sanity of WB executives and editors and makes you wonder what were they thinking during the editing process. What I got out of the Ultimate Edition was a thought-provoking deconstruction of two very iconic superheroes that gave spotlight to the struggles both of them face when they aren't fighting crime. What I got was an extremely well produced character study on both Batman and Superman in a cynical world, a world dangerously close to our own. We meet Batman as a ruthless, worn out hero that has seen the failure behind his ideals and witnessed some truly horrifying things in his life. Superman, on the other hand, is portrayed as a godlike figure that seeks to do good in the world, but finds himself emotionally conflicted once he realized that every good deed he does leaves behind a trail of destruction (most of it due to Luthor's antics). In my opinion, this is a hugely original approach, one that distances itself from the rest of the competition and delivers a dark, somber, yet relevant superhero movie that understands both characters and gives them real human struggles to deal with. I felt invested in both of them, and hoped that by the end of the film both could find a way to redeem themselves. Their character arcs were very well established during the first two acts of the movie, and by the time we get to the titular climactic battle the emotion behind the jaw-dropping action is intensified. Lex Luthor as a villain was also given more time to develop with this new edition. One of the main criticisms with the original version was the fact that his plan relied too much on conveniences, and the character's mannerisms and mad-scientist attitude was annoying, and that goes without saying his motivations were unclear. Not only do we spend more time understanding his hate for any godlike figure and thus his hatred for Superman, but the added scenes allowed us to witness his entire plan come to fruition. It sells the cold, manipulative, calculating attributes of his comic counterpart. The acting is spot on. Every actor owns his/her role, from Cavill's Superman, to Ben Affleck as Batman, Eisenberg as Luthor, and Gadot as Wonder Woman, whose scenes are brief, but are more than enough to sell the strong and ferocious warrior that she is. Cinematography is stunning, and miles above that of Man of Steel's. And the soundtrack by Zimmer and Junkie XL? Perfect, just perfect. When it comes to flaws, the film still has some of those. The Martha moment, while serving as a pivotal character moment for Batman, felt off in execution, and its understandable that many people got mad at it. If your main complaint about BvS the first time around was its bleak tone and subject matter, this film is still not for you. I understand most were expecting to see the heroes being the most iconic versions of themselves, clashing in an elongated battle and evoking the same feelings The Avengers gave audiences back in 2012. In that sense, the film will remain divisive, but at least I have the comfort of saying that, at the very least, the film is competently made."

"This film was amazing. Ben Affleck was easily the best part of this movie, he brought his a-game as Batman. The chemistry between Affleck & Irons was outstanding. Gal Gadot did a great job as Wonder Woman. The fight between Batman & Superman was awesome. The final fight with Doomsday was outstanding in every way possible. However, there is only one problem with this film and that's Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor. He was sadly missed cast in this role, but then again it's really the fault of Warner Bros. Studios. Overall, this film deliver on almost every level. I highly recommend that you watch the extended version of this film."

"I know I know. I saw it in theaters too, and felt like it could've been so much better. While the Batman element was good, the narrative felt fractured, and the third act was just one long stunt scene. Superman was relegated to a supporting character, and other characters didn't get a chance to shine. And then I chanced on the ultimate cut. Calling it 30 mins of \"extra\" footage is unfair to Zack Snyder because it's exactly these 30 mins that makes the movie a worthy one. What I can say about the theatrical cut is this - It had the blockbuster elements - music, visuals, stunts, CGI. But, it lacked the human elements. The first 20 mins of the movie had it, but not after that. The extended cut in comparison has a flow to the narrative. There are no disjointed scenes, everything flows smoothly, and there's connective tissue. Superman gets to spend some time with his father, and mother. Clark Kent does some investigative journalism. Superman helps the people after the blast. Lois Lane doesn't jump to conclusions, she gets to the bottom of the crime. Lex Luthor apparently had a coherent plan - everything is explained pretty well. Wonder Woman was already good, so there's no change there :) Also, the \"Martha\" scene seems better executed, because it is a few seconds longer, and there's time to breathe it in. So, here's my take on this movie - The theatrical cut was junk. Get the Bluray for ultimate edition, and you shall not be disappointed. I've seen it so many more times now, and it's the definitive cut. It is the movie we deserve. It's a unique take on Batman, and Superman. It's a gritty take on the superhero movie genre, and definitely the best DCEU movie, and the best DC movie since The Dark Knight.P.S. Yes it's dark. We're adults, and we should appreciate mature film making without intentionally silly moments. It attempts to be philosophical, and something deep instead of just trying to make you chuckle."

"This is one of the best superhero movies ever made. Zack Snyder is a magician behind the camera.The reason behind so many complaints is the fact that Warner Bros. marketed this movie as a fight between Batman and Superman. That's not what it is. It's a movie about the origins of the Justice League.The cinematography, the acting and the score are all second to none. This film is phenomenal.P.S: watch the 3 hour extended cut that Snyder intended you to see, not the 2 and a half hour movie that Warner Bros. decided would be better for theaters."

"I don't care what the critics say, this is a very well-done movie. I'll start my review by listing what I like about the movie.1.) Ben Affleck is the best batman to me and it is not close. He pulls off the role of an aging batman extremely well. Also, Zack Snyder's vision of batman is legit. I have always hated batman up until this adaptation of him. Instead of being a conflicted and idealistic batman, this batman is dark, gritty, and 100% a badass. His equipment is decked out with machine guns and he has no aversion to killing people. In fact, he probably kills about 50 criminal by the time this movie is over. The warehouse scene is the coolest batman scene in any movie.2.) The development of a grudge between batman and superman is pulled off flawlessly. It actually makes sense why batman dislikes superman. Then, when they do fight it is about the coolest thing you can expect to see from a superhero film. 3.) I disagree with a lot of people about Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor. In my opinion, he played his role to perfection. 4.) B v S sets up Wonder Woman and Justice League with Gal Gadot's cameo as Wonder Woman and short clips of Aquaman, the Flash, and Cyborg. B v S is one of my favorite superhero films and rewatching it never gets old."

"The theatrical cut of this film is garbage which is why I rated it eight stars instead of nine. The first time I watched this film I didn't like it (not straight out hate but didn't like). Character motivations didn't make any sense, Lex was annoying as s***, editing was sloppy, and it was overly dark and broody for an action superhero movie. A year + a half, five Marvel films, a ton of bad reviews and a Justice League later a thought popped into my head: \"what if I watched BVS again\". This time I didn't have trailers ruining the best moments, I only vaguely remembered the film, and I was conditioned to look at it negatively but something unexpected happened: I actually loved it. Superman was just a normal person that tried to make a difference cause he could that others imposed their own beliefs on. Lex Luthor was a genius that couldn't stand his powerlessness compared to Superman or more accurately a super being. As Alfred said \"The fever, the rage, the feeling of powerlessness that turns good men... cruel\" and you see the same thought process in Batman. Batman, just like Lex Luthor feels powerless in the midst of a god-being and just like Lex he attempts to destroy him so he can get his sense of power back but unlike Lex, Batman learns something. I what is one of the corniest lines of the movie Superman says, \"Martha\" when he knows he can't win against Batman in a late desperate attempt to save his mother. Not only does this name connect with Bruce Wayne but it also shows what really matters to a man of steel: it isn't power, it isn't fame or anything else, it is his Mother and on a broader scale it is people. Lex (who doesn't care about people at all) knows he doesn't have the power so he creates something from his blood and the remains of Zod: A Doomsday for Superman. Not only does this film have depth but it also doesn't always explain it to you which is rare in a blockbuster action superhero flick normally cater to semi-comic book fans and people that want to shove popcorn in their mouths. This film rewards you for really noticing the details while still having massive explosions. One of my favorites is how Lex has all of Batman's branded killed which is why he isn't afraid of the branding at the end or Grandma's Peach Tea as a way of scaring the s*** out of someone. Of course, this film isn't perfect and I do have personal dislikes. The Batman V Superman fight was slow and pretty boring especially after watching such an amazing fight in Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 2 (If you haven't watched the animated Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 1 and 2 you are sorely missing out on something fantastic). Also, the addition of Wonder Woman who pretty much steals a hacker thing, gives it back and then suits up and fights against a giant monster thing. Not to say I don't like Wonder Woman (She is one of my favorite Superheroes of all time who showed not only can woman kick a** but they also don't need to be ashamed of their sexuality or gender) but she wasn't really that helpful to the plot and just brought in to expand the universe which was well done through Lex's superhuman hunting files. Also, the post-apocalyptic scene that was just a dream could have been cut but nothing is perfect except movies like Citizen Kane which isn't a lot of fun to watch cause it is too perfect. So to summarize, the theatrical cut is bad, the ultimate cut is Amazing and the other cut is meh. Please give it a second chance because it deserves it and save a good director from losing grace because of something he didn't do."
"I really liked it, don't know what all the hate is about. I'm actually a Marvel fan from when I was 7 or so, but Superman and Batman together in 1 movie? Just great. And personally I like Ben Affleck even better than Christian Bale as Batman. So just watch and enjoy, I know I did!"

"That's right. We have been waiting for these two heroes to finally meet and fight against each other. This movie is so good in both plot and special effects.Henry Cavill and Ben Affleck have performed well in their acting stages. They are the best superhero actors and they have filmed their fighting scenes very well. The movie starts to show the conflict between the lives of the heroes and now they have blamed each other for it. This movie is amazing and sets up a good plot for Dawn Justice."

"Actually...I didn't know what to expect. When you see Wonder Woman, you know it will be off of Wonder Woman and off of a Wonder Woman story, but with Batman V Superman, I was like, \"hmmmm, so who is this about?\" It was pretty obvious that it would feature many characters, but I thought the introduction to Batman was amazing. Ben Affleck nailed the part, not only as Batman but also as Bruce Wayne. He is my Batman. Henry Cavill continued to be super as the Man of Steel. And he is my Super - Man. A dark story? Yes, without a doubt. Could it have had a few more jokes? Sure. But not all movies or stories need to have jokes when certain events are serious. I really hope people can see this review and take another look at the movie, because, I loved it. I really hope the ratings can go up, eventually. And P.S, this movie is the perfect set up to Justice League."

"I'll start by making it clear I have only ever seen the Ultimate Edition. I'm aware of what was cut out for the theatrical release, so I will concede up front that most of the criticisms about pacing, editing, and missing bits of plot at release were merited.With that caveat out of the way, I must reiterate that this was bar-none the boldest superhero movie I have ever seen. To me, it was arguably the best as well, though \"best\" shouldn't be taken to mean \"most enjoyable.\" That honor easily goes to \"Thor: Ragnarok.\" What makes BvS stand out among other films in the genre is that it takes two characters who have been done to death since the 1970s and brings them up to date. I recently tried to watch \"Superman: The Movie\" for the first time in a number of years, and while it was still good and Reeves will always be iconic, I just couldn't take it seriously. I'll put it this way: If the story in BvS was \"stupid\" in your view but Superman turning back time by spinning the earth backward on its axis didn't seem like one of the dumbest things you have ever seen -in any movie from any genre- to the extent that it outright ruins the movie for you, then your opinion about BvS isn't worth much. Nostalgic bias was always going to be a problem for this movie, and the way people reacted to and reviewed \"Man of Steel\" was telling in this regard.That brings me to Zack Snyder's take on Superman. You know, that guy whose status as the first extraterrestrial ever encountered by humanity was a total non-issue in the old movies. Apparently, Snyder has a similar view to my own in that his take on the Man of Steel makes his being an alien a core piece of his identity. He may look like any other (absurdly attractive) person, but he knows what he is, and that makes him perpetually uncertain of where he fits in this world. He is essentially good and really does care about people, but he struggles to truly empathize with the likes of us. To be human is to be frail, and that is not something he can easily relate to. This is the root of his conflict with Batman.Just as Clark struggles to genuinely relate to most people, Snyder's Batman either refuses to or otherwise just can't relate to Superman. He doesn't see him as anything but a threat regardless of Superman's clear good intentions. Remember, a small group of Kryptonians were able to bring humanity to the brink of extinction in less than a day, and Bruce Wayne is nothing if not a realist. He didn't know the guy from Kansas. He only knew the god from another world.While Batman's anger toward and fear of Superman are readily apparent from the start, Superman's inability to imagine things from Bruce Wayne's perspective only becomes truly apparent during their first real interaction. This reminded me of the animated version of the \"world's finest\" storyline, where Superman judges Batman harshly for using fear tactics and threats of violence (also, actual violence) to get the job done. Superman wasn't willing to consider what it would take for a human man to fight criminals and save innocents, or what that life would do to him over time. Just as Batman didn't see the guy from Kansas, Superman didn't see the man who lives his life trapped in one brutal, unthinkably traumatic moment (this was beautifully conveyed during the film's opening moments), and had spent his whole adult life bearing witness to humanity at its absolute worst.The conflict between these two characters is as old as human history. They want the same things, but they can't understand one another. So they fight. And what a fight it was.Watching a fight between, say, Captain America and Iron Man was, to me, more frustrating than anything because each understood the other's perspective perfectly. The fight between Batman and Superman in BvS was genuinely gut-wrenching, as intended, because they would have understood one another if either had tried. The whole sequence hilighted Batman's tactical prowess and ability to control a situation. Maybe the most badass thing about the fight was that it ended exactly where Batman planned. That brings me to the big elephant in the room named \"Martha.\"I can't recall exactly which YouTuber put it this way, but if you thought the \"save Martha\" exchange was about their mothers having the same name, you had your brain turned off. The brain-on people have explained this to death, but it bears repeating. This was the moment when Superman became humanized to Batman. He was about to die, and his only concern was for his adoptive human mother. He still believed that the man about to take his life would do the right thing. Even with the cowl on, there was no mistaking the look on Batman's face. It was the look of shame, guilt, and sudden uncertainty that says \"What am I doing?\" Turns out even the most brutal, angry version of Bruce Wayne is better than Tony Stark at knowing right from wrong. At knowing that he had gone too far.From there, the third act was a series of truly impressive (albeit mostly CGI) fight sequences, beginning with what I regard as the undisputed champion of Batman fights. Nothing in the Nolan movies (and especially nothing in the Burton movies) even came close. Go ahead, try to convince yourself that Batman and Bane taking turns punching one another in the face until Bane's mask broke was a good fight sequence. No, this was a fight straight out of \"Arkham Knight,\" and it was glorious. The battle against Doomsday really was one for the books. From the moment Wonder Woman arrived accompanied by the intense sounds of Tina Guo's electric cello to Superman's tragic, heroic death at the hands of Doomsday, I was glued to the screen. Sure, the mere presence of Doomsday spoiled the end to a degree, but watching the Man of Steel laboring to carry that kryptonite spear towards certain death was no less impactful. A brief word on Jesse Eisenberg's take on Lex Luthor. At least one other reviewer on this site already said it best when they pointed out that this was his origin story. If you consider his scheme objectively, he is actually one of the more formidable incarnations of the character. If we're lucky, we'll eventually get to see a Snyder Cut of \"Justice League\" and find out where this story was actually meant to go. For the record, Joss Whedon and Danny Elfman both should have said \"no\" to taking a dump on someone else's art."
"BATMAN V SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE brings a fantastic surprise to a smash-hit team-up with one of the worlds most beloved DC Comics' icons of all time. The movie delivers spectacular casting, and fantastic acting with different characters having their shine in each scenes.The story follows Clark Kent/Superman who becomes a threat, after the destruction in Metropolis in Man Of Steel.(2013). Batman/Bruce Wayne sees him as a threat and begins his war on Superman.The movie brings spectacular storytelling, it tells the complications of human against alien who are on the same side, and the first meeting of Batman and Superman. The story of Bruce Wayne, with his many years of The Caped Crusader, sends him on a spiral of \"out of control\", sheer anger, and builds tension to wanting to defeat the Man of Steel. Snyder has fantastically gave this storytelling an exciting nod to the comics.Lex Luthor, played by Jesse Einsberg, delivers a very interesting performance, but very differently by him showing is his \"origin\" before he becomes a bald foe to the Man of Steel. He shows that his love of \"god vs man\" terrorises mankind when he ultimately creates Doomsday, and Batman realises Superman's inner heroism.It packs so many great \"out of nowhere\" excitement, including a first-look of the fearful Wonder Woman a.k.a. Diana Prince, played by Gal Gadot, and a fresh-new glimpse of the superhero DC canon: The Justice League.WATCH THIS MOVIE! The critics are out of their mind. It's a fun-packed action adventure which still keeps the movie enjoyable until it's final minutes of the movie. It's a FANTASTIC MOVIE! BEN AFFLECK AS BATMAN... is Incredible!A 10/10 overall!"
"I want to go on record as saying that this is a truly thrilling cinematic experience in so many ways. If pressed, I guess I could acknowledge that there were a couple ... let's say \"clumsy\" moments. And in a film that runs to three hours, that hardly seems like a significant issue, certainly not enough to rate it with fewer than 9 stars.This film has everything. There is dramatic tension right from the start. There is a magnificent story arc that picks up quite seamlessly from 'Man of Steel' and propels the viewer not only into the life of Clark Kent/Superman but also of Bruce Wayne/Batman.The villain is no mere cartoon of a villain; he is truly thoroughly (and apparently irrevocably) diabolical. He is a psychopath, and you wish for his death over and over and over. You want Superman to reduce him to ash with the power of his eyes.I have read a number of viewers' reviews, and it seems that the people who disliked the film / gave it a low rating had rather unfair and unrealistic expectations of it. That is, their own prejudices about how the plot could/should unfold or what the character development could/should be, etc. ruined the film for them. And that is a shame.My thought is: I settle into my seat, wait for the lights to dim, and then I wait to be transported by the film. I accept it, lock, stock, and barrel.As another reviewer remarked, I love how the film begins from the point of view of Bruce Wayne as he is among people on the ground who have fallen victim to the attack of Zod and the other Kryptonians.Why would Bruce Wayne not like Superman? Why would the good people of Earth hurl insults at Superman and burn him in effigy (on the news)? Because the good people of Earth just got catapulted into a new reality in which there are not only extraterrestrial beings (surprise!) but they are also superman! And a group of them are hell-bent on destroying humankind and taking the planet for themselves.It is difficult to see Superman as separate from the whole Kryptonian Krew.It seems that many moviegoers forgot that Bruce Wayne is also human. Sure, he's a hero, but he is flawed.. Just like the rest of us. He is a vigilante, after all.He has let his vigilantism get the better of him. HE is actually the one working outside the boundaries of the law, not Superman. It is the clear head of Alfred that shows us that he has gone into a rather dark place, that he has not seen what is really going on (in Luthor's scheme), and so he chooses to embark on his own scheme scheme to take out the alien invader. He is (allegedly) thinking of the future: if he wipes out the all-powerful alien, then it can't turn on humankind in the future. At least, he convinces himself of that.A philosophical question is raised in the film: should Clark Kent have remained a simple man from Kansas and never have become the Superman? Should he just let people die and let calamities happen? The question is answered for us in the character of Diana Prince/Wonder Woman. She withdrew from mankind (her exact words) and just sat around watching. Watching while people died horrible deaths all around her. So, should Superman have done the same? Do these special beings, these 'metahumans', have some kind of moral imperative to intervene, or should they be allowed to be regular people, too? It seems that humans want it both ways.It seems that humans are saying: \"Don't be a superalien ... except when I and my friends and family are in trouble. Then come save us.\""

"Batman v Superman: Ultimate Edition: If your looking for a quick, cheap thrill then you might not enjoy this film at the time. This movies theatrical version was butchered by WB and in doing so reshaped the story leaving numerous plot holes. So the Ultimate Edition is the full story and the one worth seeing. Watch 'Man of Steel' before seeing this movie. There is much to claw through here, so much so that the audience might easily find themselves exhausted from the overall aggression of the film. However, a lot of the story does work. The action is good, and the emotion feels real most of the time.This film is about Superman trying to become Superman. Trying to help the world, save people, find a place in this world not as an outcast, and yet is looked at has a threat by many. Superman is not from this world, yet He is trying to be human, find a place in this world, be excepted by earths people, and come into his destiny.This film is also about Batman being Batman for 20 years and losing faith in humanity, and fearing Superman, what Superman can do with his powers. Great film, great plot, great visuals. ---Yidioo"
"I didn't see the film in the theaters and just bought the \"Extended Edition \" on Amazon. I never properly saw Man of Steel- i think I rented it and watched it when already exhausted and fell asleep. I saw the mediocre user reviews and horrible reviews from critics of this film.They really have it wrong. This is the very best either Batman or Superman. It has a different take, on things. Much darker then earlier films even darker then the Christopher Nolan Batman films.First of all Christopher Nolan is an Executive Producer. So how bad could it be? I loved Sucker Punch and Zack Snyder was involved with that. So how bad could this be? Hans Zimmer did the music, so how bad could it be?I remember watching the old Superman TV shows and reading the Superman and Batman comics as a little kid and loved them, but i wouldn't call myself a \"fan boy\" of comic universes, like so many younger people today. As an older adult I will admit my favorite TV show of all time was Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but watched it on DVD only after it had finished. I saw the second of the Dark Knight series in the theater, but the other two, I watched on DVD. They were great, but not my favorite films like so many people. i also loved the first couple Superman and Batman films in the older series. Regardless, i was not waiting with baited breath to see Man of Steel or this one.I'm more of a serious film fan, who can watch Stanley Kubrick films over and over and my favorite films in the last twenty years, are Eyes Wide Shut and Intersteller, both of which i've watched multiple times.So, with that said, take it from me, the critics have this film very wrong, just as critics hated 2001: A Space Odyssey when it first came out. This film will have lasting appreciation.Surprised how much I liked Ben Afleck's Batman. it was hard to get into Henry Cavil's scrawnier looking Superman, but it grew on me. Amy Adams was great as Lois Lane, The Gal Gadol Wonder Women was amazing. Lex Luther was terrific, like Nolan's Joker. Jeremy Irons was the best Alfred ever. Holly Hunter and Diane Lane was good too. The movie had bad reviews but made a billion dollars. Hopefully everyone buys the Ultimate Edition and it breaks sales records and the film is re-appreciated. I have no idea what scenes this Ultimate Edition added, but it is pretty perfect. Now I can't wait for Wonder Woman and the Justice League and as soon as I finish writing this am going to watch Man of Steal. I'm into it now!I can only surmise that the bad reviews stem from too much expectations of the rigid fan boy types and the radical changes in tone, we see in this film.Total masterpiece of cinema, but I have a few criticisms. There are a few hollow scenes of typical Idiot cops and authorities getting everything wrong in a cliché type way and it has a few filler scenes of that type and a few moments here and there that felt rushed and cheesy. Maybe not everything restored into the Ultimate Edition should have been. I wish there had been more Kevin Costner scenes."

"The whole entire Batman V Superman movie was great and yes even though it felt slow to the majority of the people who watched it but to me I enjoyed every part and every scene of Batman V Superman and when it got to the fight scenes both batman VS Superman and the Doomsday fight it brought so much drama, intensity, and epic performances. So with that being said I give this movie a good 10/10 because it really did go to my expectations and it brought a powerful performance and a powerful yet epic introduction to the upcoming Justice League."

"When I first wrote a review for this movie a year ago exclaiming my excitement for the film, I had been high off a fresh dose of live-action DC superheroes playing out the beloved comic book stories that I had grown up on. It was all playing out before my eyes and coming to life. After a few months had passed, I began to notice things about the movie that I disliked: little gaps in the story, things that didn't add up, etc. My original rating of a 10 / 10 dropped to an 8 /10. But today it has gone back up to a 10. The extended version of the film not only rectifies the gaps but also silences critics.Many claimed that the movie was too dark or that it just didn't make sense. To those people, I say: \"Pick up a comic book!\" Many of the critics of this particular film were part of the superhero bandwagon that formed when Marvel began its spree of Avengers-related films. In fact, its estimated that over 60% of people who go to see 'superhero' genre films have never picked up a comic book in their life. I would argue that similar numbers could figure to those which view the CW televised DC Universe shows. People complain that DC comics is just too dark but the fact is that these movies are based upon actual comics which are meant to be dark (ex: The Dark Knight Returns, Injustice, etc.). Its like complaining that Game of Thrones (the TV series) sucks because they kill off too many characters. Read the books! Its frustrating to see such a beautiful work of art like Batman V Superman criticized by those ignorant to its universe and its meaning. This movie is in fact a catalyst that opens numerous doorways and leaves true fans in awe of the possibilities for future movies. But regardless of whether or not people choose to educate themselves, this film's DVD/Blu-ray extended version puts the theater release to shame. All of the plot holes and gaps are filled in 30 minutes of extended footage scattered throughout the film. The movie ultimately becomes more complete and people will wish that the movie had shown the full 3 hours of footage in its theatrical debut. As a major DC comics fan, I will of course pick up on things that a comics fan would not, but someone who does not read comics would learn to appreciate this film in its entirety with the extended version. Get your hands on a copy today or find it on Netflix or the internet somewhere!"

"I ignored the bad reviews and watched anyways. This film had a lot to live up to after Civil War was released and I went into this film expecting the worst. It ended up to be the best Superhero film of 2016 to me. One complaint was that this film was more concerned about universe building than telling a great story than Civil War but for me it was the other way around; Civil War felt like a build up to something else and to be honest, I felt that way when I saw the other MCU films. Batman vs Superman however not only had a great story, but it also felt a lot more consistent than Civil War. This film was way more diverse with the cast than the MCU but unlike the MCU, I felt like this film doesn't go overboard with the SJW stuff like the MCU films or The Star Wars Sequel films do. The Visuals were AMAZING, The Score by Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL was AMAZING as well, The Tone is just right as I actually felt for the characters emotionally, The Cinematography kept my eyes glued to the screen, and the script felt really Intelligent and Complex and despite people calling the writing confusing, I was able to piece it together with no problem whatsoever. This film is similar to Empire Strikes back in terms of popularity so over time after the other movies are released, this movie would probably be more popular.This film was way better than I Expected and deserves another chance.

"Its shame to see what critics and marvel fans did to this movie and targeted Zack Snyder for it. I have seen this movie more than 25 times till date. And i enjoy this movie as much as i enjoyed the first time. The fans who have read DC comics, wouldn't be disappointed in this movie. Its dark movie, yes it is. Because the title shows the intense situation at hand. Two superheroes about to rip each other apart for whatever reasons that brought them to this stage. Yes it had to be dark and intense.Only marvel can be stupid enough to show an alien invasion where humans are loosing the battle and the super heroes are cracking jokes while battles as if they are playing ping pong. a person playing Call of Duty game is more serious while playing than the marvel heroes fighting aliens."

"Last week some news came out from somebody online who had claimed to have seen a finished version of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. If you were like me, you've been leery of checking it out because you weren't sure how much might actually be true. Now Zack Snyder has spoken out about the spoiler-filled post, although his response doesn't really clear anything up.In a word, to MTV, he called the post \"hilarious,which might imply that he's saying that it's mostly, if not entirely, untrue. That might be the case, but then again he could have just said it was untrue and he didn't say that. What he did say, however, is that he doesn't like spoilers. While this may seem odd for the director who's most recent trailer appeared to give away the entire movie, Snyder says that's not the case. Even if you've seen the trailer, you can rest easy, as there is much more we have not seen in then finished film. Says Snyder I have the benefit of seeing the movie. It's cool that think it's too much, and I appreciate people not wanting to know, but there's plenty that they don't know. There's a lot of movie that's not in the trailer. In the process of calling the Batman v Superman Reddit review hilarious, Snyder goes on to talk about how he hates it when spoilers come out. The director would much rather that fans see the movie mostly blind. While he understands that some fans may wish to find the answers before hand, he wants his movies to be mysteries going in. If you're, as an audience member, exploring these articles, looking for answers to questions that you have, maybe you're okay with knowing before you go. It's like an individual taste. But like I said, I want people to see the movie without knowing.Spoilers are a topic that mean different things to different people. While most try to avoid them to some degree, the need to solve the mystery is a nearly universal human experience. We have an inclination to want to know the truth, even while also wanting to be surprised. For most of us getting some information is good, but getting all the information is bad, of course, only getting the details that you want can be difficult."
"The theatrical is choppy, poorly edited, hard to follow, with some really good moments mixed in their. The extended is much more fluent and is much easier to follow, it does have a long runtime, which might make it seem a bit dragging on, but if you like long films done right, like Lord of the Rings, you will like this movie as long as you get into the characters and story. Speaking of which, the story starts out perfectly showing Bruce Wayne as a character, and it is very powerful. There are several moments in this movie that are powerful, emotional, and shocking. Characters. Batman is my favorite fictional character of all time, and believe me when I say, Ben Affleck as Batman was perfect, he had the charisma, the anger, and the look of being through some bad stuff Gal Gadot also does perfect as Wonder Woman, but if you want to really see how good she does, go watch the Wonder Woman movie. Henry Call as Superman. I really don't like it when people say Christopher Reeves is better. Don't get me wrong, Reeves does great, but can you imagine him as Superman in this movie? I wouldn't like it. It would be like Adam West playing Batman in The Dark Knight. Henry Cavill does great in this role, I can say everything about him as I said with Ben Affleck. Jesse Eisenberg as Luthor. I thought it was different in a good way. I've heard a criticism for him as being too much like Joker, but is that a bad thing? Joker is my favorite villain, so to see Superman have an enemy that crazy, but still hold the values Luthor needs to be Luthor, I think it is great. The thing I thought this movie was lacking in the first and second acts was humor, at least good humor. If there was more humor, I would've given this movie a ten because it would give a more relaxing feel to the parts that needed it. All in all though, this movie was awesome, it had powerful moments, it was badass, and just plain fun. It had a great story arc and does its job very well."

"*I will be talking about the Ultimate Edition of the film* This was one of the most anticipated CBM of all time. Ever since the arrival and subsequent success of Marvel's The Avengers people have wondered when will DC launch its own cinematic universe, one of the main reasons being the opportunity to finally see titans such as Batman and Superman share the screen together: the ultimate nerd dream. On 2016, the moment finally came for BvS to be released AND.. it performed poorly. Not only did critical reception left a lot to be desired, but fan reactions where surprisingly split after its cinematic debut. People either loved it and called Zack a genius, or hated it and called him a hack. Me, personally, I found myself with middle of the road feelings, for sure, but more leaning towards the negative side with subsequent viewings. The theatrical cut of the film showcased amazing performances, incredible visuals, and action set pieces that seemed like comic book panels come to life, in a good way. However, when it comes to its narrative structure and more technical aspects like editing, the film was seriously flawed. More plot holes than Age of Ultron, questionable character decisions, random editing that lacked cohesion and focus, and forced dramatic moments that lacked any impact because the attempts at character development ranged from limited to nonexistent, especially when it comes to Superman's character. I thought it was a 5/10 movie at best. As such, I was kind of skeptical about the idea of a 30 minute longer version. I say kind of because I know how Zack works. I remember Watchmen being vastly improved with its director's cut, so in a way I was expecting BvS to perform in a similar manner, but I also feared those 30 minutes wold be just there to amplify action and discredit storytelling issues. Oh boy, I'm so glad I was proved wrong. The ultimate cut of the film was infuriating, but not because it was awful, but because it questions the sanity of WB executives and editors and makes you wonder what were they thinking during the editing process. What I got out of the Ultimate Edition was a thought-provoking deconstruction of two very iconic superheroes that gave spotlight to the struggles both of them face when they aren't fighting crime. What I got was an extremely well produced character study on both Batman and Superman in a cynical world, a world dangerously close to our own. We meet Batman as a ruthless, worn out hero that has seen the failure behind his ideals and witnessed some truly horrifying things in his life. Superman, on the other hand, is portrayed as a godlike figure that seeks to do good in the world, but finds himself emotionally conflicted once he realized that every good deed he does leaves behind a trail of destruction (most of it due to Luthor's antics). In my opinion, this is a hugely original approach, one that distances itself from the rest of the competition and delivers a dark, somber, yet relevant superhero movie that understands both characters and gives them real human struggles to deal with. I felt invested in both of them, and hoped that by the end of the film both could find a way to redeem themselves. Their character arcs were very well established during the first two acts of the movie, and by the time we get to the titular climactic battle the emotion behind the jaw-dropping action is intensified. Lex Luthor as a villain was also given more time to develop with this new edition. One of the main criticisms with the original version was the fact that his plan relied too much on conveniences, and the character's mannerisms and mad-scientist attitude was annoying, and that goes without saying his motivations were unclear. Not only do we spend more time understanding his hate for any godlike figure and thus his hatred for Superman, but the added scenes allowed us to witness his entire plan come to fruition. It sells the cold, manipulative, calculating attributes of his comic counterpart. The acting is spot on. Every actor owns his/her role, from Cavill's Superman, to Ben Affleck as Batman, Eisenberg as Luthor, and Gadot as Wonder Woman, whose scenes are brief, but are more than enough to sell the strong and ferocious warrior that she is. Cinematography is stunning, and miles above that of Man of Steel's. And the soundtrack by Zimmer and Junkie XL? Perfect, just perfect. When it comes to flaws, the film still has some of those. The Martha moment, while serving as a pivotal character moment for Batman, felt off in execution, and its understandable that many people got mad at it. If your main complaint about BvS the first time around was its bleak tone and subject matter, this film is still not for you. I understand most were expecting to see the heroes being the most iconic versions of themselves, clashing in an elongated battle and evoking the same feelings The Avengers gave audiences back in 2012. In that sense, the film will remain divisive, but at least I have the comfort of saying that, at the very least, the film is competently made."

"This film was amazing. Ben Affleck was easily the best part of this movie, he brought his a-game as Batman. The chemistry between Affleck & Irons was outstanding. Gal Gadot did a great job as Wonder Woman. The fight between Batman & Superman was awesome. The final fight with Doomsday was outstanding in every way possible. However, there is only one problem with this film and that's Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor. He was sadly missed cast in this role, but then again it's really the fault of Warner Bros. Studios. Overall, this film deliver on almost every level. I highly recommend that you watch the extended version of this film."

"I know I know. I saw it in theaters too, and felt like it could've been so much better. While the Batman element was good, the narrative felt fractured, and the third act was just one long stunt scene. Superman was relegated to a supporting character, and other characters didn't get a chance to shine. And then I chanced on the ultimate cut. Calling it 30 mins of \"extra\" footage is unfair to Zack Snyder because it's exactly these 30 mins that makes the movie a worthy one. What I can say about the theatrical cut is this - It had the blockbuster elements - music, visuals, stunts, CGI. But, it lacked the human elements. The first 20 mins of the movie had it, but not after that. The extended cut in comparison has a flow to the narrative. There are no disjointed scenes, everything flows smoothly, and there's connective tissue. Superman gets to spend some time with his father, and mother. Clark Kent does some investigative journalism. Superman helps the people after the blast. Lois Lane doesn't jump to conclusions, she gets to the bottom of the crime. Lex Luthor apparently had a coherent plan - everything is explained pretty well. Wonder Woman was already good, so there's no change there :) Also, the \"Martha\" scene seems better executed, because it is a few seconds longer, and there's time to breathe it in. So, here's my take on this movie - The theatrical cut was junk. Get the Bluray for ultimate edition, and you shall not be disappointed. I've seen it so many more times now, and it's the definitive cut. It is the movie we deserve. It's a unique take on Batman, and Superman. It's a gritty take on the superhero movie genre, and definitely the best DCEU movie, and the best DC movie since The Dark Knight.P.S. Yes it's dark. We're adults, and we should appreciate mature film making without intentionally silly moments. It attempts to be philosophical, and something deep instead of just trying to make you chuckle."

"This is one of the best superhero movies ever made. Zack Snyder is a magician behind the camera.The reason behind so many complaints is the fact that Warner Bros. marketed this movie as a fight between Batman and Superman. That's not what it is. It's a movie about the origins of the Justice League.The cinematography, the acting and the score are all second to none. This film is phenomenal.P.S: watch the 3 hour extended cut that Snyder intended you to see, not the 2 and a half hour movie that Warner Bros. decided would be better for theaters."

"I don't care what the critics say, this is a very well-done movie. I'll start my review by listing what I like about the movie.1.) Ben Affleck is the best batman to me and it is not close. He pulls off the role of an aging batman extremely well. Also, Zack Snyder's vision of batman is legit. I have always hated batman up until this adaptation of him. Instead of being a conflicted and idealistic batman, this batman is dark, gritty, and 100% a badass. His equipment is decked out with machine guns and he has no aversion to killing people. In fact, he probably kills about 50 criminal by the time this movie is over. The warehouse scene is the coolest batman scene in any movie.2.) The development of a grudge between batman and superman is pulled off flawlessly. It actually makes sense why batman dislikes superman. Then, when they do fight it is about the coolest thing you can expect to see from a superhero film. 3.) I disagree with a lot of people about Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor. In my opinion, he played his role to perfection. 4.) B v S sets up Wonder Woman and Justice League with Gal Gadot's cameo as Wonder Woman and short clips of Aquaman, the Flash, and Cyborg. B v S is one of my favorite superhero films and rewatching it never gets old."

"The theatrical cut of this film is garbage which is why I rated it eight stars instead of nine. The first time I watched this film I didn't like it (not straight out hate but didn't like). Character motivations didn't make any sense, Lex was annoying as s***, editing was sloppy, and it was overly dark and broody for an action superhero movie. A year + a half, five Marvel films, a ton of bad reviews and a Justice League later a thought popped into my head: \"what if I watched BVS again\". This time I didn't have trailers ruining the best moments, I only vaguely remembered the film, and I was conditioned to look at it negatively but something unexpected happened: I actually loved it. Superman was just a normal person that tried to make a difference cause he could that others imposed their own beliefs on. Lex Luthor was a genius that couldn't stand his powerlessness compared to Superman or more accurately a super being. As Alfred said \"The fever, the rage, the feeling of powerlessness that turns good men... cruel\" and you see the same thought process in Batman. Batman, just like Lex Luthor feels powerless in the midst of a god-being and just like Lex he attempts to destroy him so he can get his sense of power back but unlike Lex, Batman learns something. I what is one of the corniest lines of the movie Superman says, \"Martha\" when he knows he can't win against Batman in a late desperate attempt to save his mother. Not only does this name connect with Bruce Wayne but it also shows what really matters to a man of steel: it isn't power, it isn't fame or anything else, it is his Mother and on a broader scale it is people. Lex (who doesn't care about people at all) knows he doesn't have the power so he creates something from his blood and the remains of Zod: A Doomsday for Superman. Not only does this film have depth but it also doesn't always explain it to you which is rare in a blockbuster action superhero flick normally cater to semi-comic book fans and people that want to shove popcorn in their mouths. This film rewards you for really noticing the details while still having massive explosions. One of my favorites is how Lex has all of Batman's branded killed which is why he isn't afraid of the branding at the end or Grandma's Peach Tea as a way of scaring the s*** out of someone. Of course, this film isn't perfect and I do have personal dislikes. The Batman V Superman fight was slow and pretty boring especially after watching such an amazing fight in Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 2 (If you haven't watched the animated Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 1 and 2 you are sorely missing out on something fantastic). Also, the addition of Wonder Woman who pretty much steals a hacker thing, gives it back and then suits up and fights against a giant monster thing. Not to say I don't like Wonder Woman (She is one of my favorite Superheroes of all time who showed not only can woman kick a** but they also don't need to be ashamed of their sexuality or gender) but she wasn't really that helpful to the plot and just brought in to expand the universe which was well done through Lex's superhuman hunting files. Also, the post-apocalyptic scene that was just a dream could have been cut but nothing is perfect except movies like Citizen Kane which isn't a lot of fun to watch cause it is too perfect. So to summarize, the theatrical cut is bad, the ultimate cut is Amazing and the other cut is meh. Please give it a second chance because it deserves it and save a good director from losing grace because of something he didn't do."
"I really liked it, don't know what all the hate is about. I'm actually a Marvel fan from when I was 7 or so, but Superman and Batman together in 1 movie? Just great. And personally I like Ben Affleck even better than Christian Bale as Batman. So just watch and enjoy, I know I did!"

"That's right. We have been waiting for these two heroes to finally meet and fight against each other. This movie is so good in both plot and special effects.Henry Cavill and Ben Affleck have performed well in their acting stages. They are the best superhero actors and they have filmed their fighting scenes very well. The movie starts to show the conflict between the lives of the heroes and now they have blamed each other for it. This movie is amazing and sets up a good plot for Dawn Justice."

"Actually...I didn't know what to expect. When you see Wonder Woman, you know it will be off of Wonder Woman and off of a Wonder Woman story, but with Batman V Superman, I was like, \"hmmmm, so who is this about?\" It was pretty obvious that it would feature many characters, but I thought the introduction to Batman was amazing. Ben Affleck nailed the part, not only as Batman but also as Bruce Wayne. He is my Batman. Henry Cavill continued to be super as the Man of Steel. And he is my Super - Man. A dark story? Yes, without a doubt. Could it have had a few more jokes? Sure. But not all movies or stories need to have jokes when certain events are serious. I really hope people can see this review and take another look at the movie, because, I loved it. I really hope the ratings can go up, eventually. And P.S, this movie is the perfect set up to Justice League."

"I'll start by making it clear I have only ever seen the Ultimate Edition. I'm aware of what was cut out for the theatrical release, so I will concede up front that most of the criticisms about pacing, editing, and missing bits of plot at release were merited.With that caveat out of the way, I must reiterate that this was bar-none the boldest superhero movie I have ever seen. To me, it was arguably the best as well, though \"best\" shouldn't be taken to mean \"most enjoyable.\" That honor easily goes to \"Thor: Ragnarok.\" What makes BvS stand out among other films in the genre is that it takes two characters who have been done to death since the 1970s and brings them up to date. I recently tried to watch \"Superman: The Movie\" for the first time in a number of years, and while it was still good and Reeves will always be iconic, I just couldn't take it seriously. I'll put it this way: If the story in BvS was \"stupid\" in your view but Superman turning back time by spinning the earth backward on its axis didn't seem like one of the dumbest things you have ever seen -in any movie from any genre- to the extent that it outright ruins the movie for you, then your opinion about BvS isn't worth much. Nostalgic bias was always going to be a problem for this movie, and the way people reacted to and reviewed \"Man of Steel\" was telling in this regard.That brings me to Zack Snyder's take on Superman. You know, that guy whose status as the first extraterrestrial ever encountered by humanity was a total non-issue in the old movies. Apparently, Snyder has a similar view to my own in that his take on the Man of Steel makes his being an alien a core piece of his identity. He may look like any other (absurdly attractive) person, but he knows what he is, and that makes him perpetually uncertain of where he fits in this world. He is essentially good and really does care about people, but he struggles to truly empathize with the likes of us. To be human is to be frail, and that is not something he can easily relate to. This is the root of his conflict with Batman.Just as Clark struggles to genuinely relate to most people, Snyder's Batman either refuses to or otherwise just can't relate to Superman. He doesn't see him as anything but a threat regardless of Superman's clear good intentions. Remember, a small group of Kryptonians were able to bring humanity to the brink of extinction in less than a day, and Bruce Wayne is nothing if not a realist. He didn't know the guy from Kansas. He only knew the god from another world.While Batman's anger toward and fear of Superman are readily apparent from the start, Superman's inability to imagine things from Bruce Wayne's perspective only becomes truly apparent during their first real interaction. This reminded me of the animated version of the \"world's finest\" storyline, where Superman judges Batman harshly for using fear tactics and threats of violence (also, actual violence) to get the job done. Superman wasn't willing to consider what it would take for a human man to fight criminals and save innocents, or what that life would do to him over time. Just as Batman didn't see the guy from Kansas, Superman didn't see the man who lives his life trapped in one brutal, unthinkably traumatic moment (this was beautifully conveyed during the film's opening moments), and had spent his whole adult life bearing witness to humanity at its absolute worst.The conflict between these two characters is as old as human history. They want the same things, but they can't understand one another. So they fight. And what a fight it was.Watching a fight between, say, Captain America and Iron Man was, to me, more frustrating than anything because each understood the other's perspective perfectly. The fight between Batman and Superman in BvS was genuinely gut-wrenching, as intended, because they would have understood one another if either had tried. The whole sequence hilighted Batman's tactical prowess and ability to control a situation. Maybe the most badass thing about the fight was that it ended exactly where Batman planned. That brings me to the big elephant in the room named \"Martha.\"I can't recall exactly which YouTuber put it this way, but if you thought the \"save Martha\" exchange was about their mothers having the same name, you had your brain turned off. The brain-on people have explained this to death, but it bears repeating. This was the moment when Superman became humanized to Batman. He was about to die, and his only concern was for his adoptive human mother. He still believed that the man about to take his life would do the right thing. Even with the cowl on, there was no mistaking the look on Batman's face. It was the look of shame, guilt, and sudden uncertainty that says \"What am I doing?\" Turns out even the most brutal, angry version of Bruce Wayne is better than Tony Stark at knowing right from wrong. At knowing that he had gone too far.From there, the third act was a series of truly impressive (albeit mostly CGI) fight sequences, beginning with what I regard as the undisputed champion of Batman fights. Nothing in the Nolan movies (and especially nothing in the Burton movies) even came close. Go ahead, try to convince yourself that Batman and Bane taking turns punching one another in the face until Bane's mask broke was a good fight sequence. No, this was a fight straight out of \"Arkham Knight,\" and it was glorious. The battle against Doomsday really was one for the books. From the moment Wonder Woman arrived accompanied by the intense sounds of Tina Guo's electric cello to Superman's tragic, heroic death at the hands of Doomsday, I was glued to the screen. Sure, the mere presence of Doomsday spoiled the end to a degree, but watching the Man of Steel laboring to carry that kryptonite spear towards certain death was no less impactful. A brief word on Jesse Eisenberg's take on Lex Luthor. At least one other reviewer on this site already said it best when they pointed out that this was his origin story. If you consider his scheme objectively, he is actually one of the more formidable incarnations of the character. If we're lucky, we'll eventually get to see a Snyder Cut of \"Justice League\" and find out where this story was actually meant to go. For the record, Joss Whedon and Danny Elfman both should have said \"no\" to taking a dump on someone else's art."
"BATMAN V SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE brings a fantastic surprise to a smash-hit team-up with one of the worlds most beloved DC Comics' icons of all time. The movie delivers spectacular casting, and fantastic acting with different characters having their shine in each scenes.The story follows Clark Kent/Superman who becomes a threat, after the destruction in Metropolis in Man Of Steel.(2013). Batman/Bruce Wayne sees him as a threat and begins his war on Superman.The movie brings spectacular storytelling, it tells the complications of human against alien who are on the same side, and the first meeting of Batman and Superman. The story of Bruce Wayne, with his many years of The Caped Crusader, sends him on a spiral of \"out of control\", sheer anger, and builds tension to wanting to defeat the Man of Steel. Snyder has fantastically gave this storytelling an exciting nod to the comics.Lex Luthor, played by Jesse Einsberg, delivers a very interesting performance, but very differently by him showing is his \"origin\" before he becomes a bald foe to the Man of Steel. He shows that his love of \"god vs man\" terrorises mankind when he ultimately creates Doomsday, and Batman realises Superman's inner heroism.It packs so many great \"out of nowhere\" excitement, including a first-look of the fearful Wonder Woman a.k.a. Diana Prince, played by Gal Gadot, and a fresh-new glimpse of the superhero DC canon: The Justice League.WATCH THIS MOVIE! The critics are out of their mind. It's a fun-packed action adventure which still keeps the movie enjoyable until it's final minutes of the movie. It's a FANTASTIC MOVIE! BEN AFFLECK AS BATMAN... is Incredible!A 10/10 overall!"
"I want to go on record as saying that this is a truly thrilling cinematic experience in so many ways. If pressed, I guess I could acknowledge that there were a couple ... let's say \"clumsy\" moments. And in a film that runs to three hours, that hardly seems like a significant issue, certainly not enough to rate it with fewer than 9 stars.This film has everything. There is dramatic tension right from the start. There is a magnificent story arc that picks up quite seamlessly from 'Man of Steel' and propels the viewer not only into the life of Clark Kent/Superman but also of Bruce Wayne/Batman.The villain is no mere cartoon of a villain; he is truly thoroughly (and apparently irrevocably) diabolical. He is a psychopath, and you wish for his death over and over and over. You want Superman to reduce him to ash with the power of his eyes.I have read a number of viewers' reviews, and it seems that the people who disliked the film / gave it a low rating had rather unfair and unrealistic expectations of it. That is, their own prejudices about how the plot could/should unfold or what the character development could/should be, etc. ruined the film for them. And that is a shame.My thought is: I settle into my seat, wait for the lights to dim, and then I wait to be transported by the film. I accept it, lock, stock, and barrel.As another reviewer remarked, I love how the film begins from the point of view of Bruce Wayne as he is among people on the ground who have fallen victim to the attack of Zod and the other Kryptonians.Why would Bruce Wayne not like Superman? Why would the good people of Earth hurl insults at Superman and burn him in effigy (on the news)? Because the good people of Earth just got catapulted into a new reality in which there are not only extraterrestrial beings (surprise!) but they are also superman! And a group of them are hell-bent on destroying humankind and taking the planet for themselves.It is difficult to see Superman as separate from the whole Kryptonian Krew.It seems that many moviegoers forgot that Bruce Wayne is also human. Sure, he's a hero, but he is flawed.. Just like the rest of us. He is a vigilante, after all.He has let his vigilantism get the better of him. HE is actually the one working outside the boundaries of the law, not Superman. It is the clear head of Alfred that shows us that he has gone into a rather dark place, that he has not seen what is really going on (in Luthor's scheme), and so he chooses to embark on his own scheme scheme to take out the alien invader. He is (allegedly) thinking of the future: if he wipes out the all-powerful alien, then it can't turn on humankind in the future. At least, he convinces himself of that.A philosophical question is raised in the film: should Clark Kent have remained a simple man from Kansas and never have become the Superman? Should he just let people die and let calamities happen? The question is answered for us in the character of Diana Prince/Wonder Woman. She withdrew from mankind (her exact words) and just sat around watching. Watching while people died horrible deaths all around her. So, should Superman have done the same? Do these special beings, these 'metahumans', have some kind of moral imperative to intervene, or should they be allowed to be regular people, too? It seems that humans want it both ways.It seems that humans are saying: \"Don't be a superalien ... except when I and my friends and family are in trouble. Then come save us.\""

"Batman v Superman: Ultimate Edition: If your looking for a quick, cheap thrill then you might not enjoy this film at the time. This movies theatrical version was butchered by WB and in doing so reshaped the story leaving numerous plot holes. So the Ultimate Edition is the full story and the one worth seeing. Watch 'Man of Steel' before seeing this movie. There is much to claw through here, so much so that the audience might easily find themselves exhausted from the overall aggression of the film. However, a lot of the story does work. The action is good, and the emotion feels real most of the time.This film is about Superman trying to become Superman. Trying to help the world, save people, find a place in this world not as an outcast, and yet is looked at has a threat by many. Superman is not from this world, yet He is trying to be human, find a place in this world, be excepted by earths people, and come into his destiny.This film is also about Batman being Batman for 20 years and losing faith in humanity, and fearing Superman, what Superman can do with his powers. Great film, great plot, great visuals. ---Yidioo"
"I didn't see the film in the theaters and just bought the \"Extended Edition \" on Amazon. I never properly saw Man of Steel- i think I rented it and watched it when already exhausted and fell asleep. I saw the mediocre user reviews and horrible reviews from critics of this film.They really have it wrong. This is the very best either Batman or Superman. It has a different take, on things. Much darker then earlier films even darker then the Christopher Nolan Batman films.First of all Christopher Nolan is an Executive Producer. So how bad could it be? I loved Sucker Punch and Zack Snyder was involved with that. So how bad could this be? Hans Zimmer did the music, so how bad could it be?I remember watching the old Superman TV shows and reading the Superman and Batman comics as a little kid and loved them, but i wouldn't call myself a \"fan boy\" of comic universes, like so many younger people today. As an older adult I will admit my favorite TV show of all time was Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but watched it on DVD only after it had finished. I saw the second of the Dark Knight series in the theater, but the other two, I watched on DVD. They were great, but not my favorite films like so many people. i also loved the first couple Superman and Batman films in the older series. Regardless, i was not waiting with baited breath to see Man of Steel or this one.I'm more of a serious film fan, who can watch Stanley Kubrick films over and over and my favorite films in the last twenty years, are Eyes Wide Shut and Intersteller, both of which i've watched multiple times.So, with that said, take it from me, the critics have this film very wrong, just as critics hated 2001: A Space Odyssey when it first came out. This film will have lasting appreciation.Surprised how much I liked Ben Afleck's Batman. it was hard to get into Henry Cavil's scrawnier looking Superman, but it grew on me. Amy Adams was great as Lois Lane, The Gal Gadol Wonder Women was amazing. Lex Luther was terrific, like Nolan's Joker. Jeremy Irons was the best Alfred ever. Holly Hunter and Diane Lane was good too. The movie had bad reviews but made a billion dollars. Hopefully everyone buys the Ultimate Edition and it breaks sales records and the film is re-appreciated. I have no idea what scenes this Ultimate Edition added, but it is pretty perfect. Now I can't wait for Wonder Woman and the Justice League and as soon as I finish writing this am going to watch Man of Steal. I'm into it now!I can only surmise that the bad reviews stem from too much expectations of the rigid fan boy types and the radical changes in tone, we see in this film.Total masterpiece of cinema, but I have a few criticisms. There are a few hollow scenes of typical Idiot cops and authorities getting everything wrong in a cliché type way and it has a few filler scenes of that type and a few moments here and there that felt rushed and cheesy. Maybe not everything restored into the Ultimate Edition should have been. I wish there had been more Kevin Costner scenes."

"The whole entire Batman V Superman movie was great and yes even though it felt slow to the majority of the people who watched it but to me I enjoyed every part and every scene of Batman V Superman and when it got to the fight scenes both batman VS Superman and the Doomsday fight it brought so much drama, intensity, and epic performances. So with that being said I give this movie a good 10/10 because it really did go to my expectations and it brought a powerful performance and a powerful yet epic introduction to the upcoming Justice League."

"When I first wrote a review for this movie a year ago exclaiming my excitement for the film, I had been high off a fresh dose of live-action DC superheroes playing out the beloved comic book stories that I had grown up on. It was all playing out before my eyes and coming to life. After a few months had passed, I began to notice things about the movie that I disliked: little gaps in the story, things that didn't add up, etc. My original rating of a 10 / 10 dropped to an 8 /10. But today it has gone back up to a 10. The extended version of the film not only rectifies the gaps but also silences critics.Many claimed that the movie was too dark or that it just didn't make sense. To those people, I say: \"Pick up a comic book!\" Many of the critics of this particular film were part of the superhero bandwagon that formed when Marvel began its spree of Avengers-related films. In fact, its estimated that over 60% of people who go to see 'superhero' genre films have never picked up a comic book in their life. I would argue that similar numbers could figure to those which view the CW televised DC Universe shows. People complain that DC comics is just too dark but the fact is that these movies are based upon actual comics which are meant to be dark (ex: The Dark Knight Returns, Injustice, etc.). Its like complaining that Game of Thrones (the TV series) sucks because they kill off too many characters. Read the books! Its frustrating to see such a beautiful work of art like Batman V Superman criticized by those ignorant to its universe and its meaning. This movie is in fact a catalyst that opens numerous doorways and leaves true fans in awe of the possibilities for future movies. But regardless of whether or not people choose to educate themselves, this film's DVD/Blu-ray extended version puts the theater release to shame. All of the plot holes and gaps are filled in 30 minutes of extended footage scattered throughout the film. The movie ultimately becomes more complete and people will wish that the movie had shown the full 3 hours of footage in its theatrical debut. As a major DC comics fan, I will of course pick up on things that a comics fan would not, but someone who does not read comics would learn to appreciate this film in its entirety with the extended version. Get your hands on a copy today or find it on Netflix or the internet somewhere!"

"I ignored the bad reviews and watched anyways. This film had a lot to live up to after Civil War was released and I went into this film expecting the worst. It ended up to be the best Superhero film of 2016 to me. One complaint was that this film was more concerned about universe building than telling a great story than Civil War but for me it was the other way around; Civil War felt like a build up to something else and to be honest, I felt that way when I saw the other MCU films. Batman vs Superman however not only had a great story, but it also felt a lot more consistent than Civil War. This film was way more diverse with the cast than the MCU but unlike the MCU, I felt like this film doesn't go overboard with the SJW stuff like the MCU films or The Star Wars Sequel films do. The Visuals were AMAZING, The Score by Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL was AMAZING as well, The Tone is just right as I actually felt for the characters emotionally, The Cinematography kept my eyes glued to the screen, and the script felt really Intelligent and Complex and despite people calling the writing confusing, I was able to piece it together with no problem whatsoever. This film is similar to Empire Strikes back in terms of popularity so over time after the other movies are released, this movie would probably be more popular.This film was way better than I Expected and deserves another chance.

"Its shame to see what critics and marvel fans did to this movie and targeted Zack Snyder for it. I have seen this movie more than 25 times till date. And i enjoy this movie as much as i enjoyed the first time. The fans who have read DC comics, wouldn't be disappointed in this movie. Its dark movie, yes it is. Because the title shows the intense situation at hand. Two superheroes about to rip each other apart for whatever reasons that brought them to this stage. Yes it had to be dark and intense.Only marvel can be stupid enough to show an alien invasion where humans are loosing the battle and the super heroes are cracking jokes while battles as if they are playing ping pong. a person playing Call of Duty game is more serious while playing than the marvel heroes fighting aliens."

"Last week some news came out from somebody online who had claimed to have seen a finished version of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. If you were like me, you've been leery of checking it out because you weren't sure how much might actually be true. Now Zack Snyder has spoken out about the spoiler-filled post, although his response doesn't really clear anything up.In a word, to MTV, he called the post \"hilarious,which might imply that he's saying that it's mostly, if not entirely, untrue. That might be the case, but then again he could have just said it was untrue and he didn't say that. What he did say, however, is that he doesn't like spoilers. While this may seem odd for the director who's most recent trailer appeared to give away the entire movie, Snyder says that's not the case. Even if you've seen the trailer, you can rest easy, as there is much more we have not seen in then finished film. Says Snyder I have the benefit of seeing the movie. It's cool that think it's too much, and I appreciate people not wanting to know, but there's plenty that they don't know. There's a lot of movie that's not in the trailer. In the process of calling the Batman v Superman Reddit review hilarious, Snyder goes on to talk about how he hates it when spoilers come out. The director would much rather that fans see the movie mostly blind. While he understands that some fans may wish to find the answers before hand, he wants his movies to be mysteries going in. If you're, as an audience member, exploring these articles, looking for answers to questions that you have, maybe you're okay with knowing before you go. It's like an individual taste. But like I said, I want people to see the movie without knowing.Spoilers are a topic that mean different things to different people. While most try to avoid them to some degree, the need to solve the mystery is a nearly universal human experience. We have an inclination to want to know the truth, even while also wanting to be surprised. For most of us getting some information is good, but getting all the information is bad, of course, only getting the details that you want can be difficult."
"The theatrical is choppy, poorly edited, hard to follow, with some really good moments mixed in their. The extended is much more fluent and is much easier to follow, it does have a long runtime, which might make it seem a bit dragging on, but if you like long films done right, like Lord of the Rings, you will like this movie as long as you get into the characters and story. Speaking of which, the story starts out perfectly showing Bruce Wayne as a character, and it is very powerful. There are several moments in this movie that are powerful, emotional, and shocking. Characters. Batman is my favorite fictional character of all time, and believe me when I say, Ben Affleck as Batman was perfect, he had the charisma, the anger, and the look of being through some bad stuff Gal Gadot also does perfect as Wonder Woman, but if you want to really see how good she does, go watch the Wonder Woman movie. Henry Call as Superman. I really don't like it when people say Christopher Reeves is better. Don't get me wrong, Reeves does great, but can you imagine him as Superman in this movie? I wouldn't like it. It would be like Adam West playing Batman in The Dark Knight. Henry Cavill does great in this role, I can say everything about him as I said with Ben Affleck. Jesse Eisenberg as Luthor. I thought it was different in a good way. I've heard a criticism for him as being too much like Joker, but is that a bad thing? Joker is my favorite villain, so to see Superman have an enemy that crazy, but still hold the values Luthor needs to be Luthor, I think it is great. The thing I thought this movie was lacking in the first and second acts was humor, at least good humor. If there was more humor, I would've given this movie a ten because it would give a more relaxing feel to the parts that needed it. All in all though, this movie was awesome, it had powerful moments, it was badass, and just plain fun. It had a great story arc and does its job very well."

"*I will be talking about the Ultimate Edition of the film* This was one of the most anticipated CBM of all time. Ever since the arrival and subsequent success of Marvel's The Avengers people have wondered when will DC launch its own cinematic universe, one of the main reasons being the opportunity to finally see titans such as Batman and Superman share the screen together: the ultimate nerd dream. On 2016, the moment finally came for BvS to be released AND.. it performed poorly. Not only did critical reception left a lot to be desired, but fan reactions where surprisingly split after its cinematic debut. People either loved it and called Zack a genius, or hated it and called him a hack. Me, personally, I found myself with middle of the road feelings, for sure, but more leaning towards the negative side with subsequent viewings. The theatrical cut of the film showcased amazing performances, incredible visuals, and action set pieces that seemed like comic book panels come to life, in a good way. However, when it comes to its narrative structure and more technical aspects like editing, the film was seriously flawed. More plot holes than Age of Ultron, questionable character decisions, random editing that lacked cohesion and focus, and forced dramatic moments that lacked any impact because the attempts at character development ranged from limited to nonexistent, especially when it comes to Superman's character. I thought it was a 5/10 movie at best. As such, I was kind of skeptical about the idea of a 30 minute longer version. I say kind of because I know how Zack works. I remember Watchmen being vastly improved with its director's cut, so in a way I was expecting BvS to perform in a similar manner, but I also feared those 30 minutes wold be just there to amplify action and discredit storytelling issues. Oh boy, I'm so glad I was proved wrong. The ultimate cut of the film was infuriating, but not because it was awful, but because it questions the sanity of WB executives and editors and makes you wonder what were they thinking during the editing process. What I got out of the Ultimate Edition was a thought-provoking deconstruction of two very iconic superheroes that gave spotlight to the struggles both of them face when they aren't fighting crime. What I got was an extremely well produced character study on both Batman and Superman in a cynical world, a world dangerously close to our own. We meet Batman as a ruthless, worn out hero that has seen the failure behind his ideals and witnessed some truly horrifying things in his life. Superman, on the other hand, is portrayed as a godlike figure that seeks to do good in the world, but finds himself emotionally conflicted once he realized that every good deed he does leaves behind a trail of destruction (most of it due to Luthor's antics). In my opinion, this is a hugely original approach, one that distances itself from the rest of the competition and delivers a dark, somber, yet relevant superhero movie that understands both characters and gives them real human struggles to deal with. I felt invested in both of them, and hoped that by the end of the film both could find a way to redeem themselves. Their character arcs were very well established during the first two acts of the movie, and by the time we get to the titular climactic battle the emotion behind the jaw-dropping action is intensified. Lex Luthor as a villain was also given more time to develop with this new edition. One of the main criticisms with the original version was the fact that his plan relied too much on conveniences, and the character's mannerisms and mad-scientist attitude was annoying, and that goes without saying his motivations were unclear. Not only do we spend more time understanding his hate for any godlike figure and thus his hatred for Superman, but the added scenes allowed us to witness his entire plan come to fruition. It sells the cold, manipulative, calculating attributes of his comic counterpart. The acting is spot on. Every actor owns his/her role, from Cavill's Superman, to Ben Affleck as Batman, Eisenberg as Luthor, and Gadot as Wonder Woman, whose scenes are brief, but are more than enough to sell the strong and ferocious warrior that she is. Cinematography is stunning, and miles above that of Man of Steel's. And the soundtrack by Zimmer and Junkie XL? Perfect, just perfect. When it comes to flaws, the film still has some of those. The Martha moment, while serving as a pivotal character moment for Batman, felt off in execution, and its understandable that many people got mad at it. If your main complaint about BvS the first time around was its bleak tone and subject matter, this film is still not for you. I understand most were expecting to see the heroes being the most iconic versions of themselves, clashing in an elongated battle and evoking the same feelings The Avengers gave audiences back in 2012. In that sense, the film will remain divisive, but at least I have the comfort of saying that, at the very least, the film is competently made."

"This film was amazing. Ben Affleck was easily the best part of this movie, he brought his a-game as Batman. The chemistry between Affleck & Irons was outstanding. Gal Gadot did a great job as Wonder Woman. The fight between Batman & Superman was awesome. The final fight with Doomsday was outstanding in every way possible. However, there is only one problem with this film and that's Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor. He was sadly missed cast in this role, but then again it's really the fault of Warner Bros. Studios. Overall, this film deliver on almost every level. I highly recommend that you watch the extended version of this film."

"I know I know. I saw it in theaters too, and felt like it could've been so much better. While the Batman element was good, the narrative felt fractured, and the third act was just one long stunt scene. Superman was relegated to a supporting character, and other characters didn't get a chance to shine. And then I chanced on the ultimate cut. Calling it 30 mins of \"extra\" footage is unfair to Zack Snyder because it's exactly these 30 mins that makes the movie a worthy one. What I can say about the theatrical cut is this - It had the blockbuster elements - music, visuals, stunts, CGI. But, it lacked the human elements. The first 20 mins of the movie had it, but not after that. The extended cut in comparison has a flow to the narrative. There are no disjointed scenes, everything flows smoothly, and there's connective tissue. Superman gets to spend some time with his father, and mother. Clark Kent does some investigative journalism. Superman helps the people after the blast. Lois Lane doesn't jump to conclusions, she gets to the bottom of the crime. Lex Luthor apparently had a coherent plan - everything is explained pretty well. Wonder Woman was already good, so there's no change there :) Also, the \"Martha\" scene seems better executed, because it is a few seconds longer, and there's time to breathe it in. So, here's my take on this movie - The theatrical cut was junk. Get the Bluray for ultimate edition, and you shall not be disappointed. I've seen it so many more times now, and it's the definitive cut. It is the movie we deserve. It's a unique take on Batman, and Superman. It's a gritty take on the superhero movie genre, and definitely the best DCEU movie, and the best DC movie since The Dark Knight.P.S. Yes it's dark. We're adults, and we should appreciate mature film making without intentionally silly moments. It attempts to be philosophical, and something deep instead of just trying to make you chuckle."

"This is one of the best superhero movies ever made. Zack Snyder is a magician behind the camera.The reason behind so many complaints is the fact that Warner Bros. marketed this movie as a fight between Batman and Superman. That's not what it is. It's a movie about the origins of the Justice League.The cinematography, the acting and the score are all second to none. This film is phenomenal.P.S: watch the 3 hour extended cut that Snyder intended you to see, not the 2 and a half hour movie that Warner Bros. decided would be better for theaters."

"I don't care what the critics say, this is a very well-done movie. I'll start my review by listing what I like about the movie.1.) Ben Affleck is the best batman to me and it is not close. He pulls off the role of an aging batman extremely well. Also, Zack Snyder's vision of batman is legit. I have always hated batman up until this adaptation of him. Instead of being a conflicted and idealistic batman, this batman is dark, gritty, and 100% a badass. His equipment is decked out with machine guns and he has no aversion to killing people. In fact, he probably kills about 50 criminal by the time this movie is over. The warehouse scene is the coolest batman scene in any movie.2.) The development of a grudge between batman and superman is pulled off flawlessly. It actually makes sense why batman dislikes superman. Then, when they do fight it is about the coolest thing you can expect to see from a superhero film. 3.) I disagree with a lot of people about Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor. In my opinion, he played his role to perfection. 4.) B v S sets up Wonder Woman and Justice League with Gal Gadot's cameo as Wonder Woman and short clips of Aquaman, the Flash, and Cyborg. B v S is one of my favorite superhero films and rewatching it never gets old."

"The theatrical cut of this film is garbage which is why I rated it eight stars instead of nine. The first time I watched this film I didn't like it (not straight out hate but didn't like). Character motivations didn't make any sense, Lex was annoying as s***, editing was sloppy, and it was overly dark and broody for an action superhero movie. A year + a half, five Marvel films, a ton of bad reviews and a Justice League later a thought popped into my head: \"what if I watched BVS again\". This time I didn't have trailers ruining the best moments, I only vaguely remembered the film, and I was conditioned to look at it negatively but something unexpected happened: I actually loved it. Superman was just a normal person that tried to make a difference cause he could that others imposed their own beliefs on. Lex Luthor was a genius that couldn't stand his powerlessness compared to Superman or more accurately a super being. As Alfred said \"The fever, the rage, the feeling of powerlessness that turns good men... cruel\" and you see the same thought process in Batman. Batman, just like Lex Luthor feels powerless in the midst of a god-being and just like Lex he attempts to destroy him so he can get his sense of power back but unlike Lex, Batman learns something. I what is one of the corniest lines of the movie Superman says, \"Martha\" when he knows he can't win against Batman in a late desperate attempt to save his mother. Not only does this name connect with Bruce Wayne but it also shows what really matters to a man of steel: it isn't power, it isn't fame or anything else, it is his Mother and on a broader scale it is people. Lex (who doesn't care about people at all) knows he doesn't have the power so he creates something from his blood and the remains of Zod: A Doomsday for Superman. Not only does this film have depth but it also doesn't always explain it to you which is rare in a blockbuster action superhero flick normally cater to semi-comic book fans and people that want to shove popcorn in their mouths. This film rewards you for really noticing the details while still having massive explosions. One of my favorites is how Lex has all of Batman's branded killed which is why he isn't afraid of the branding at the end or Grandma's Peach Tea as a way of scaring the s*** out of someone. Of course, this film isn't perfect and I do have personal dislikes. The Batman V Superman fight was slow and pretty boring especially after watching such an amazing fight in Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 2 (If you haven't watched the animated Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 1 and 2 you are sorely missing out on something fantastic). Also, the addition of Wonder Woman who pretty much steals a hacker thing, gives it back and then suits up and fights against a giant monster thing. Not to say I don't like Wonder Woman (She is one of my favorite Superheroes of all time who showed not only can woman kick a** but they also don't need to be ashamed of their sexuality or gender) but she wasn't really that helpful to the plot and just brought in to expand the universe which was well done through Lex's superhuman hunting files. Also, the post-apocalyptic scene that was just a dream could have been cut but nothing is perfect except movies like Citizen Kane which isn't a lot of fun to watch cause it is too perfect. So to summarize, the theatrical cut is bad, the ultimate cut is Amazing and the other cut is meh. Please give it a second chance because it deserves it and save a good director from losing grace because of something he didn't do."
"I really liked it, don't know what all the hate is about. I'm actually a Marvel fan from when I was 7 or so, but Superman and Batman together in 1 movie? Just great. And personally I like Ben Affleck even better than Christian Bale as Batman. So just watch and enjoy, I know I did!"

"That's right. We have been waiting for these two heroes to finally meet and fight against each other. This movie is so good in both plot and special effects.Henry Cavill and Ben Affleck have performed well in their acting stages. They are the best superhero actors and they have filmed their fighting scenes very well. The movie starts to show the conflict between the lives of the heroes and now they have blamed each other for it. This movie is amazing and sets up a good plot for Dawn Justice."

"Actually...I didn't know what to expect. When you see Wonder Woman, you know it will be off of Wonder Woman and off of a Wonder Woman story, but with Batman V Superman, I was like, \"hmmmm, so who is this about?\" It was pretty obvious that it would feature many characters, but I thought the introduction to Batman was amazing. Ben Affleck nailed the part, not only as Batman but also as Bruce Wayne. He is my Batman. Henry Cavill continued to be super as the Man of Steel. And he is my Super - Man. A dark story? Yes, without a doubt. Could it have had a few more jokes? Sure. But not all movies or stories need to have jokes when certain events are serious. I really hope people can see this review and take another look at the movie, because, I loved it. I really hope the ratings can go up, eventually. And P.S, this movie is the perfect set up to Justice League."

"I'll start by making it clear I have only ever seen the Ultimate Edition. I'm aware of what was cut out for the theatrical release, so I will concede up front that most of the criticisms about pacing, editing, and missing bits of plot at release were merited.With that caveat out of the way, I must reiterate that this was bar-none the boldest superhero movie I have ever seen. To me, it was arguably the best as well, though \"best\" shouldn't be taken to mean \"most enjoyable.\" That honor easily goes to \"Thor: Ragnarok.\" What makes BvS stand out among other films in the genre is that it takes two characters who have been done to death since the 1970s and brings them up to date. I recently tried to watch \"Superman: The Movie\" for the first time in a number of years, and while it was still good and Reeves will always be iconic, I just couldn't take it seriously. I'll put it this way: If the story in BvS was \"stupid\" in your view but Superman turning back time by spinning the earth backward on its axis didn't seem like one of the dumbest things you have ever seen -in any movie from any genre- to the extent that it outright ruins the movie for you, then your opinion about BvS isn't worth much. Nostalgic bias was always going to be a problem for this movie, and the way people reacted to and reviewed \"Man of Steel\" was telling in this regard.That brings me to Zack Snyder's take on Superman. You know, that guy whose status as the first extraterrestrial ever encountered by humanity was a total non-issue in the old movies. Apparently, Snyder has a similar view to my own in that his take on the Man of Steel makes his being an alien a core piece of his identity. He may look like any other (absurdly attractive) person, but he knows what he is, and that makes him perpetually uncertain of where he fits in this world. He is essentially good and really does care about people, but he struggles to truly empathize with the likes of us. To be human is to be frail, and that is not something he can easily relate to. This is the root of his conflict with Batman.Just as Clark struggles to genuinely relate to most people, Snyder's Batman either refuses to or otherwise just can't relate to Superman. He doesn't see him as anything but a threat regardless of Superman's clear good intentions. Remember, a small group of Kryptonians were able to bring humanity to the brink of extinction in less than a day, and Bruce Wayne is nothing if not a realist. He didn't know the guy from Kansas. He only knew the god from another world.While Batman's anger toward and fear of Superman are readily apparent from the start, Superman's inability to imagine things from Bruce Wayne's perspective only becomes truly apparent during their first real interaction. This reminded me of the animated version of the \"world's finest\" storyline, where Superman judges Batman harshly for using fear tactics and threats of violence (also, actual violence) to get the job done. Superman wasn't willing to consider what it would take for a human man to fight criminals and save innocents, or what that life would do to him over time. Just as Batman didn't see the guy from Kansas, Superman didn't see the man who lives his life trapped in one brutal, unthinkably traumatic moment (this was beautifully conveyed during the film's opening moments), and had spent his whole adult life bearing witness to humanity at its absolute worst.The conflict between these two characters is as old as human history. They want the same things, but they can't understand one another. So they fight. And what a fight it was.Watching a fight between, say, Captain America and Iron Man was, to me, more frustrating than anything because each understood the other's perspective perfectly. The fight between Batman and Superman in BvS was genuinely gut-wrenching, as intended, because they would have understood one another if either had tried. The whole sequence hilighted Batman's tactical prowess and ability to control a situation. Maybe the most badass thing about the fight was that it ended exactly where Batman planned. That brings me to the big elephant in the room named \"Martha.\"I can't recall exactly which YouTuber put it this way, but if you thought the \"save Martha\" exchange was about their mothers having the same name, you had your brain turned off. The brain-on people have explained this to death, but it bears repeating. This was the moment when Superman became humanized to Batman. He was about to die, and his only concern was for his adoptive human mother. He still believed that the man about to take his life would do the right thing. Even with the cowl on, there was no mistaking the look on Batman's face. It was the look of shame, guilt, and sudden uncertainty that says \"What am I doing?\" Turns out even the most brutal, angry version of Bruce Wayne is better than Tony Stark at knowing right from wrong. At knowing that he had gone too far.From there, the third act was a series of truly impressive (albeit mostly CGI) fight sequences, beginning with what I regard as the undisputed champion of Batman fights. Nothing in the Nolan movies (and especially nothing in the Burton movies) even came close. Go ahead, try to convince yourself that Batman and Bane taking turns punching one another in the face until Bane's mask broke was a good fight sequence. No, this was a fight straight out of \"Arkham Knight,\" and it was glorious. The battle against Doomsday really was one for the books. From the moment Wonder Woman arrived accompanied by the intense sounds of Tina Guo's electric cello to Superman's tragic, heroic death at the hands of Doomsday, I was glued to the screen. Sure, the mere presence of Doomsday spoiled the end to a degree, but watching the Man of Steel laboring to carry that kryptonite spear towards certain death was no less impactful. A brief word on Jesse Eisenberg's take on Lex Luthor. At least one other reviewer on this site already said it best when they pointed out that this was his origin story. If you consider his scheme objectively, he is actually one of the more formidable incarnations of the character. If we're lucky, we'll eventually get to see a Snyder Cut of \"Justice League\" and find out where this story was actually meant to go. For the record, Joss Whedon and Danny Elfman both should have said \"no\" to taking a dump on someone else's art."
"BATMAN V SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE brings a fantastic surprise to a smash-hit team-up with one of the worlds most beloved DC Comics' icons of all time. The movie delivers spectacular casting, and fantastic acting with different characters having their shine in each scenes.The story follows Clark Kent/Superman who becomes a threat, after the destruction in Metropolis in Man Of Steel.(2013). Batman/Bruce Wayne sees him as a threat and begins his war on Superman.The movie brings spectacular storytelling, it tells the complications of human against alien who are on the same side, and the first meeting of Batman and Superman. The story of Bruce Wayne, with his many years of The Caped Crusader, sends him on a spiral of \"out of control\", sheer anger, and builds tension to wanting to defeat the Man of Steel. Snyder has fantastically gave this storytelling an exciting nod to the comics.Lex Luthor, played by Jesse Einsberg, delivers a very interesting performance, but very differently by him showing is his \"origin\" before he becomes a bald foe to the Man of Steel. He shows that his love of \"god vs man\" terrorises mankind when he ultimately creates Doomsday, and Batman realises Superman's inner heroism.It packs so many great \"out of nowhere\" excitement, including a first-look of the fearful Wonder Woman a.k.a. Diana Prince, played by Gal Gadot, and a fresh-new glimpse of the superhero DC canon: The Justice League.WATCH THIS MOVIE! The critics are out of their mind. It's a fun-packed action adventure which still keeps the movie enjoyable until it's final minutes of the movie. It's a FANTASTIC MOVIE! BEN AFFLECK AS BATMAN... is Incredible!A 10/10 overall!"
"I want to go on record as saying that this is a truly thrilling cinematic experience in so many ways. If pressed, I guess I could acknowledge that there were a couple ... let's say \"clumsy\" moments. And in a film that runs to three hours, that hardly seems like a significant issue, certainly not enough to rate it with fewer than 9 stars.This film has everything. There is dramatic tension right from the start. There is a magnificent story arc that picks up quite seamlessly from 'Man of Steel' and propels the viewer not only into the life of Clark Kent/Superman but also of Bruce Wayne/Batman.The villain is no mere cartoon of a villain; he is truly thoroughly (and apparently irrevocably) diabolical. He is a psychopath, and you wish for his death over and over and over. You want Superman to reduce him to ash with the power of his eyes.I have read a number of viewers' reviews, and it seems that the people who disliked the film / gave it a low rating had rather unfair and unrealistic expectations of it. That is, their own prejudices about how the plot could/should unfold or what the character development could/should be, etc. ruined the film for them. And that is a shame.My thought is: I settle into my seat, wait for the lights to dim, and then I wait to be transported by the film. I accept it, lock, stock, and barrel.As another reviewer remarked, I love how the film begins from the point of view of Bruce Wayne as he is among people on the ground who have fallen victim to the attack of Zod and the other Kryptonians.Why would Bruce Wayne not like Superman? Why would the good people of Earth hurl insults at Superman and burn him in effigy (on the news)? Because the good people of Earth just got catapulted into a new reality in which there are not only extraterrestrial beings (surprise!) but they are also superman! And a group of them are hell-bent on destroying humankind and taking the planet for themselves.It is difficult to see Superman as separate from the whole Kryptonian Krew.It seems that many moviegoers forgot that Bruce Wayne is also human. Sure, he's a hero, but he is flawed.. Just like the rest of us. He is a vigilante, after all.He has let his vigilantism get the better of him. HE is actually the one working outside the boundaries of the law, not Superman. It is the clear head of Alfred that shows us that he has gone into a rather dark place, that he has not seen what is really going on (in Luthor's scheme), and so he chooses to embark on his own scheme scheme to take out the alien invader. He is (allegedly) thinking of the future: if he wipes out the all-powerful alien, then it can't turn on humankind in the future. At least, he convinces himself of that.A philosophical question is raised in the film: should Clark Kent have remained a simple man from Kansas and never have become the Superman? Should he just let people die and let calamities happen? The question is answered for us in the character of Diana Prince/Wonder Woman. She withdrew from mankind (her exact words) and just sat around watching. Watching while people died horrible deaths all around her. So, should Superman have done the same? Do these special beings, these 'metahumans', have some kind of moral imperative to intervene, or should they be allowed to be regular people, too? It seems that humans want it both ways.It seems that humans are saying: \"Don't be a superalien ... except when I and my friends and family are in trouble. Then come save us.\""

"Batman v Superman: Ultimate Edition: If your looking for a quick, cheap thrill then you might not enjoy this film at the time. This movies theatrical version was butchered by WB and in doing so reshaped the story leaving numerous plot holes. So the Ultimate Edition is the full story and the one worth seeing. Watch 'Man of Steel' before seeing this movie. There is much to claw through here, so much so that the audience might easily find themselves exhausted from the overall aggression of the film. However, a lot of the story does work. The action is good, and the emotion feels real most of the time.This film is about Superman trying to become Superman. Trying to help the world, save people, find a place in this world not as an outcast, and yet is looked at has a threat by many. Superman is not from this world, yet He is trying to be human, find a place in this world, be excepted by earths people, and come into his destiny.This film is also about Batman being Batman for 20 years and losing faith in humanity, and fearing Superman, what Superman can do with his powers. Great film, great plot, great visuals. ---Yidioo"
"I didn't see the film in the theaters and just bought the \"Extended Edition \" on Amazon. I never properly saw Man of Steel- i think I rented it and watched it when already exhausted and fell asleep. I saw the mediocre user reviews and horrible reviews from critics of this film.They really have it wrong. This is the very best either Batman or Superman. It has a different take, on things. Much darker then earlier films even darker then the Christopher Nolan Batman films.First of all Christopher Nolan is an Executive Producer. So how bad could it be? I loved Sucker Punch and Zack Snyder was involved with that. So how bad could this be? Hans Zimmer did the music, so how bad could it be?I remember watching the old Superman TV shows and reading the Superman and Batman comics as a little kid and loved them, but i wouldn't call myself a \"fan boy\" of comic universes, like so many younger people today. As an older adult I will admit my favorite TV show of all time was Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but watched it on DVD only after it had finished. I saw the second of the Dark Knight series in the theater, but the other two, I watched on DVD. They were great, but not my favorite films like so many people. i also loved the first couple Superman and Batman films in the older series. Regardless, i was not waiting with baited breath to see Man of Steel or this one.I'm more of a serious film fan, who can watch Stanley Kubrick films over and over and my favorite films in the last twenty years, are Eyes Wide Shut and Intersteller, both of which i've watched multiple times.So, with that said, take it from me, the critics have this film very wrong, just as critics hated 2001: A Space Odyssey when it first came out. This film will have lasting appreciation.Surprised how much I liked Ben Afleck's Batman. it was hard to get into Henry Cavil's scrawnier looking Superman, but it grew on me. Amy Adams was great as Lois Lane, The Gal Gadol Wonder Women was amazing. Lex Luther was terrific, like Nolan's Joker. Jeremy Irons was the best Alfred ever. Holly Hunter and Diane Lane was good too. The movie had bad reviews but made a billion dollars. Hopefully everyone buys the Ultimate Edition and it breaks sales records and the film is re-appreciated. I have no idea what scenes this Ultimate Edition added, but it is pretty perfect. Now I can't wait for Wonder Woman and the Justice League and as soon as I finish writing this am going to watch Man of Steal. I'm into it now!I can only surmise that the bad reviews stem from too much expectations of the rigid fan boy types and the radical changes in tone, we see in this film.Total masterpiece of cinema, but I have a few criticisms. There are a few hollow scenes of typical Idiot cops and authorities getting everything wrong in a cliché type way and it has a few filler scenes of that type and a few moments here and there that felt rushed and cheesy. Maybe not everything restored into the Ultimate Edition should have been. I wish there had been more Kevin Costner scenes."

"The whole entire Batman V Superman movie was great and yes even though it felt slow to the majority of the people who watched it but to me I enjoyed every part and every scene of Batman V Superman and when it got to the fight scenes both batman VS Superman and the Doomsday fight it brought so much drama, intensity, and epic performances. So with that being said I give this movie a good 10/10 because it really did go to my expectations and it brought a powerful performance and a powerful yet epic introduction to the upcoming Justice League."

"Zack Snyder not only understands the characters but he also understands how to craft a real amazing movie for fans - honestly blew me away (extended cut) Brilliant!Don't believe what the internet is telling you to think - take this from a person who has worked in the comic book industry - this is amazing!"

"When I first wrote a review for this movie a year ago exclaiming my excitement for the film, I had been high off a fresh dose of live-action DC superheroes playing out the beloved comic book stories that I had grown up on. It was all playing out before my eyes and coming to life. After a few months had passed, I began to notice things about the movie that I disliked: little gaps in the story, things that didn't add up, etc. My original rating of a 10 / 10 dropped to an 8 /10. But today it has gone back up to a 10. The extended version of the film not only rectifies the gaps but also silences critics.Many claimed that the movie was too dark or that it just didn't make sense. To those people, I say: \"Pick up a comic book!\" Many of the critics of this particular film were part of the superhero bandwagon that formed when Marvel began its spree of Avengers-related films. In fact, its estimated that over 60% of people who go to see 'superhero' genre films have never picked up a comic book in their life. I would argue that similar numbers could figure to those which view the CW televised DC Universe shows. People complain that DC comics is just too dark but the fact is that these movies are based upon actual comics which are meant to be dark (ex: The Dark Knight Returns, Injustice, etc.). Its like complaining that Game of Thrones (the TV series) sucks because they kill off too many characters. Read the books! Its frustrating to see such a beautiful work of art like Batman V Superman criticized by those ignorant to its universe and its meaning. This movie is in fact a catalyst that opens numerous doorways and leaves true fans in awe of the possibilities for future movies. But regardless of whether or not people choose to educate themselves, this film's DVD/Blu-ray extended version puts the theater release to shame. All of the plot holes and gaps are filled in 30 minutes of extended footage scattered throughout the film. The movie ultimately becomes more complete and people will wish that the movie had shown the full 3 hours of footage in its theatrical debut. As a major DC comics fan, I will of course pick up on things that a comics fan would not, but someone who does not read comics would learn to appreciate this film in its entirety with the extended version. Get your hands on a copy today or find it on Netflix or the internet somewhere!"

"I ignored the bad reviews and watched anyways. This film had a lot to live up to after Civil War was released and I went into this film expecting the worst. It ended up to be the best Superhero film of 2016 to me. One complaint was that this film was more concerned about universe building than telling a great story than Civil War but for me it was the other way around; Civil War felt like a build up to something else and to be honest, I felt that way when I saw the other MCU films. Batman vs Superman however not only had a great story, but it also felt a lot more consistent than Civil War. This film was way more diverse with the cast than the MCU but unlike the MCU, I felt like this film doesn't go overboard with the SJW stuff like the MCU films or The Star Wars Sequel films do. The Visuals were AMAZING, The Score by Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL was AMAZING as well, The Tone is just right as I actually felt for the characters emotionally, The Cinematography kept my eyes glued to the screen, and the script felt really Intelligent and Complex and despite people calling the writing confusing, I was able to piece it together with no problem whatsoever. This film is similar to Empire Strikes back in terms of popularity so over time after the other movies are released, this movie would probably be more popular.This film was way better than I Expected and deserves another chance.

"Its shame to see what critics and marvel fans did to this movie and targeted Zack Snyder for it. I have seen this movie more than 25 times till date. And i enjoy this movie as much as i enjoyed the first time. The fans who have read DC comics, wouldn't be disappointed in this movie. Its dark movie, yes it is. Because the title shows the intense situation at hand. Two superheroes about to rip each other apart for whatever reasons that brought them to this stage. Yes it had to be dark and intense.Only marvel can be stupid enough to show an alien invasion where humans are loosing the battle and the super heroes are cracking jokes while battles as if they are playing ping pong. a person playing Call of Duty game is more serious while playing than the marvel heroes fighting aliens."

"Last week some news came out from somebody online who had claimed to have seen a finished version of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. If you were like me, you've been leery of checking it out because you weren't sure how much might actually be true. Now Zack Snyder has spoken out about the spoiler-filled post, although his response doesn't really clear anything up.In a word, to MTV, he called the post \"hilarious,which might imply that he's saying that it's mostly, if not entirely, untrue. That might be the case, but then again he could have just said it was untrue and he didn't say that. What he did say, however, is that he doesn't like spoilers. While this may seem odd for the director who's most recent trailer appeared to give away the entire movie, Snyder says that's not the case. Even if you've seen the trailer, you can rest easy, as there is much more we have not seen in then finished film. Says Snyder I have the benefit of seeing the movie. It's cool that think it's too much, and I appreciate people not wanting to know, but there's plenty that they don't know. There's a lot of movie that's not in the trailer. In the process of calling the Batman v Superman Reddit review hilarious, Snyder goes on to talk about how he hates it when spoilers come out. The director would much rather that fans see the movie mostly blind. While he understands that some fans may wish to find the answers before hand, he wants his movies to be mysteries going in. If you're, as an audience member, exploring these articles, looking for answers to questions that you have, maybe you're okay with knowing before you go. It's like an individual taste. But like I said, I want people to see the movie without knowing.Spoilers are a topic that mean different things to different people. While most try to avoid them to some degree, the need to solve the mystery is a nearly universal human experience. We have an inclination to want to know the truth, even while also wanting to be surprised. For most of us getting some information is good, but getting all the information is bad, of course, only getting the details that you want can be difficult."
"The theatrical is choppy, poorly edited, hard to follow, with some really good moments mixed in their. The extended is much more fluent and is much easier to follow, it does have a long runtime, which might make it seem a bit dragging on, but if you like long films done right, like Lord of the Rings, you will like this movie as long as you get into the characters and story. Speaking of which, the story starts out perfectly showing Bruce Wayne as a character, and it is very powerful. There are several moments in this movie that are powerful, emotional, and shocking. Characters. Batman is my favorite fictional character of all time, and believe me when I say, Ben Affleck as Batman was perfect, he had the charisma, the anger, and the look of being through some bad stuff Gal Gadot also does perfect as Wonder Woman, but if you want to really see how good she does, go watch the Wonder Woman movie. Henry Call as Superman. I really don't like it when people say Christopher Reeves is better. Don't get me wrong, Reeves does great, but can you imagine him as Superman in this movie? I wouldn't like it. It would be like Adam West playing Batman in The Dark Knight. Henry Cavill does great in this role, I can say everything about him as I said with Ben Affleck. Jesse Eisenberg as Luthor. I thought it was different in a good way. I've heard a criticism for him as being too much like Joker, but is that a bad thing? Joker is my favorite villain, so to see Superman have an enemy that crazy, but still hold the values Luthor needs to be Luthor, I think it is great. The thing I thought this movie was lacking in the first and second acts was humor, at least good humor. If there was more humor, I would've given this movie a ten because it would give a more relaxing feel to the parts that needed it. All in all though, this movie was awesome, it had powerful moments, it was badass, and just plain fun. It had a great story arc and does its job very well."

"*I will be talking about the Ultimate Edition of the film* This was one of the most anticipated CBM of all time. Ever since the arrival and subsequent success of Marvel's The Avengers people have wondered when will DC launch its own cinematic universe, one of the main reasons being the opportunity to finally see titans such as Batman and Superman share the screen together: the ultimate nerd dream. On 2016, the moment finally came for BvS to be released AND.. it performed poorly. Not only did critical reception left a lot to be desired, but fan reactions where surprisingly split after its cinematic debut. People either loved it and called Zack a genius, or hated it and called him a hack. Me, personally, I found myself with middle of the road feelings, for sure, but more leaning towards the negative side with subsequent viewings. The theatrical cut of the film showcased amazing performances, incredible visuals, and action set pieces that seemed like comic book panels come to life, in a good way. However, when it comes to its narrative structure and more technical aspects like editing, the film was seriously flawed. More plot holes than Age of Ultron, questionable character decisions, random editing that lacked cohesion and focus, and forced dramatic moments that lacked any impact because the attempts at character development ranged from limited to nonexistent, especially when it comes to Superman's character. I thought it was a 5/10 movie at best. As such, I was kind of skeptical about the idea of a 30 minute longer version. I say kind of because I know how Zack works. I remember Watchmen being vastly improved with its director's cut, so in a way I was expecting BvS to perform in a similar manner, but I also feared those 30 minutes wold be just there to amplify action and discredit storytelling issues. Oh boy, I'm so glad I was proved wrong. The ultimate cut of the film was infuriating, but not because it was awful, but because it questions the sanity of WB executives and editors and makes you wonder what were they thinking during the editing process. What I got out of the Ultimate Edition was a thought-provoking deconstruction of two very iconic superheroes that gave spotlight to the struggles both of them face when they aren't fighting crime. What I got was an extremely well produced character study on both Batman and Superman in a cynical world, a world dangerously close to our own. We meet Batman as a ruthless, worn out hero that has seen the failure behind his ideals and witnessed some truly horrifying things in his life. Superman, on the other hand, is portrayed as a godlike figure that seeks to do good in the world, but finds himself emotionally conflicted once he realized that every good deed he does leaves behind a trail of destruction (most of it due to Luthor's antics). In my opinion, this is a hugely original approach, one that distances itself from the rest of the competition and delivers a dark, somber, yet relevant superhero movie that understands both characters and gives them real human struggles to deal with. I felt invested in both of them, and hoped that by the end of the film both could find a way to redeem themselves. Their character arcs were very well established during the first two acts of the movie, and by the time we get to the titular climactic battle the emotion behind the jaw-dropping action is intensified. Lex Luthor as a villain was also given more time to develop with this new edition. One of the main criticisms with the original version was the fact that his plan relied too much on conveniences, and the character's mannerisms and mad-scientist attitude was annoying, and that goes without saying his motivations were unclear. Not only do we spend more time understanding his hate for any godlike figure and thus his hatred for Superman, but the added scenes allowed us to witness his entire plan come to fruition. It sells the cold, manipulative, calculating attributes of his comic counterpart. The acting is spot on. Every actor owns his/her role, from Cavill's Superman, to Ben Affleck as Batman, Eisenberg as Luthor, and Gadot as Wonder Woman, whose scenes are brief, but are more than enough to sell the strong and ferocious warrior that she is. Cinematography is stunning, and miles above that of Man of Steel's. And the soundtrack by Zimmer and Junkie XL? Perfect, just perfect. When it comes to flaws, the film still has some of those. The Martha moment, while serving as a pivotal character moment for Batman, felt off in execution, and its understandable that many people got mad at it. If your main complaint about BvS the first time around was its bleak tone and subject matter, this film is still not for you. I understand most were expecting to see the heroes being the most iconic versions of themselves, clashing in an elongated battle and evoking the same feelings The Avengers gave audiences back in 2012. In that sense, the film will remain divisive, but at least I have the comfort of saying that, at the very least, the film is competently made."

"This film was amazing. Ben Affleck was easily the best part of this movie, he brought his a-game as Batman. The chemistry between Affleck & Irons was outstanding. Gal Gadot did a great job as Wonder Woman. The fight between Batman & Superman was awesome. The final fight with Doomsday was outstanding in every way possible. However, there is only one problem with this film and that's Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor. He was sadly missed cast in this role, but then again it's really the fault of Warner Bros. Studios. Overall, this film deliver on almost every level. I highly recommend that you watch the extended version of this film."

"I know I know. I saw it in theaters too, and felt like it could've been so much better. While the Batman element was good, the narrative felt fractured, and the third act was just one long stunt scene. Superman was relegated to a supporting character, and other characters didn't get a chance to shine. And then I chanced on the ultimate cut. Calling it 30 mins of \"extra\" footage is unfair to Zack Snyder because it's exactly these 30 mins that makes the movie a worthy one. What I can say about the theatrical cut is this - It had the blockbuster elements - music, visuals, stunts, CGI. But, it lacked the human elements. The first 20 mins of the movie had it, but not after that. The extended cut in comparison has a flow to the narrative. There are no disjointed scenes, everything flows smoothly, and there's connective tissue. Superman gets to spend some time with his father, and mother. Clark Kent does some investigative journalism. Superman helps the people after the blast. Lois Lane doesn't jump to conclusions, she gets to the bottom of the crime. Lex Luthor apparently had a coherent plan - everything is explained pretty well. Wonder Woman was already good, so there's no change there :) Also, the \"Martha\" scene seems better executed, because it is a few seconds longer, and there's time to breathe it in. So, here's my take on this movie - The theatrical cut was junk. Get the Bluray for ultimate edition, and you shall not be disappointed. I've seen it so many more times now, and it's the definitive cut. It is the movie we deserve. It's a unique take on Batman, and Superman. It's a gritty take on the superhero movie genre, and definitely the best DCEU movie, and the best DC movie since The Dark Knight.P.S. Yes it's dark. We're adults, and we should appreciate mature film making without intentionally silly moments. It attempts to be philosophical, and something deep instead of just trying to make you chuckle."

"This is one of the best superhero movies ever made. Zack Snyder is a magician behind the camera.The reason behind so many complaints is the fact that Warner Bros. marketed this movie as a fight between Batman and Superman. That's not what it is. It's a movie about the origins of the Justice League.The cinematography, the acting and the score are all second to none. This film is phenomenal.P.S: watch the 3 hour extended cut that Snyder intended you to see, not the 2 and a half hour movie that Warner Bros. decided would be better for theaters."

"I don't care what the critics say, this is a very well-done movie. I'll start my review by listing what I like about the movie.1.) Ben Affleck is the best batman to me and it is not close. He pulls off the role of an aging batman extremely well. Also, Zack Snyder's vision of batman is legit. I have always hated batman up until this adaptation of him. Instead of being a conflicted and idealistic batman, this batman is dark, gritty, and 100% a badass. His equipment is decked out with machine guns and he has no aversion to killing people. In fact, he probably kills about 50 criminal by the time this movie is over. The warehouse scene is the coolest batman scene in any movie.2.) The development of a grudge between batman and superman is pulled off flawlessly. It actually makes sense why batman dislikes superman. Then, when they do fight it is about the coolest thing you can expect to see from a superhero film. 3.) I disagree with a lot of people about Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor. In my opinion, he played his role to perfection. 4.) B v S sets up Wonder Woman and Justice League with Gal Gadot's cameo as Wonder Woman and short clips of Aquaman, the Flash, and Cyborg. B v S is one of my favorite superhero films and rewatching it never gets old."

"The theatrical cut of this film is garbage which is why I rated it eight stars instead of nine. The first time I watched this film I didn't like it (not straight out hate but didn't like). Character motivations didn't make any sense, Lex was annoying as s***, editing was sloppy, and it was overly dark and broody for an action superhero movie. A year + a half, five Marvel films, a ton of bad reviews and a Justice League later a thought popped into my head: \"what if I watched BVS again\". This time I didn't have trailers ruining the best moments, I only vaguely remembered the film, and I was conditioned to look at it negatively but something unexpected happened: I actually loved it. Superman was just a normal person that tried to make a difference cause he could that others imposed their own beliefs on. Lex Luthor was a genius that couldn't stand his powerlessness compared to Superman or more accurately a super being. As Alfred said \"The fever, the rage, the feeling of powerlessness that turns good men... cruel\" and you see the same thought process in Batman. Batman, just like Lex Luthor feels powerless in the midst of a god-being and just like Lex he attempts to destroy him so he can get his sense of power back but unlike Lex, Batman learns something. I what is one of the corniest lines of the movie Superman says, \"Martha\" when he knows he can't win against Batman in a late desperate attempt to save his mother. Not only does this name connect with Bruce Wayne but it also shows what really matters to a man of steel: it isn't power, it isn't fame or anything else, it is his Mother and on a broader scale it is people. Lex (who doesn't care about people at all) knows he doesn't have the power so he creates something from his blood and the remains of Zod: A Doomsday for Superman. Not only does this film have depth but it also doesn't always explain it to you which is rare in a blockbuster action superhero flick normally cater to semi-comic book fans and people that want to shove popcorn in their mouths. This film rewards you for really noticing the details while still having massive explosions. One of my favorites is how Lex has all of Batman's branded killed which is why he isn't afraid of the branding at the end or Grandma's Peach Tea as a way of scaring the s*** out of someone. Of course, this film isn't perfect and I do have personal dislikes. The Batman V Superman fight was slow and pretty boring especially after watching such an amazing fight in Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 2 (If you haven't watched the animated Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 1 and 2 you are sorely missing out on something fantastic). Also, the addition of Wonder Woman who pretty much steals a hacker thing, gives it back and then suits up and fights against a giant monster thing. Not to say I don't like Wonder Woman (She is one of my favorite Superheroes of all time who showed not only can woman kick a** but they also don't need to be ashamed of their sexuality or gender) but she wasn't really that helpful to the plot and just brought in to expand the universe which was well done through Lex's superhuman hunting files. Also, the post-apocalyptic scene that was just a dream could have been cut but nothing is perfect except movies like Citizen Kane which isn't a lot of fun to watch cause it is too perfect. So to summarize, the theatrical cut is bad, the ultimate cut is Amazing and the other cut is meh. Please give it a second chance because it deserves it and save a good director from losing grace because of something he didn't do."
"I really liked it, don't know what all the hate is about. I'm actually a Marvel fan from when I was 7 or so, but Superman and Batman together in 1 movie? Just great. And personally I like Ben Affleck even better than Christian Bale as Batman. So just watch and enjoy, I know I did!"

"That's right. We have been waiting for these two heroes to finally meet and fight against each other. This movie is so good in both plot and special effects.Henry Cavill and Ben Affleck have performed well in their acting stages. They are the best superhero actors and they have filmed their fighting scenes very well. The movie starts to show the conflict between the lives of the heroes and now they have blamed each other for it. This movie is amazing and sets up a good plot for Dawn Justice."

"Actually...I didn't know what to expect. When you see Wonder Woman, you know it will be off of Wonder Woman and off of a Wonder Woman story, but with Batman V Superman, I was like, \"hmmmm, so who is this about?\" It was pretty obvious that it would feature many characters, but I thought the introduction to Batman was amazing. Ben Affleck nailed the part, not only as Batman but also as Bruce Wayne. He is my Batman. Henry Cavill continued to be super as the Man of Steel. And he is my Super - Man. A dark story? Yes, without a doubt. Could it have had a few more jokes? Sure. But not all movies or stories need to have jokes when certain events are serious. I really hope people can see this review and take another look at the movie, because, I loved it. I really hope the ratings can go up, eventually. And P.S, this movie is the perfect set up to Justice League."

"I'll start by making it clear I have only ever seen the Ultimate Edition. I'm aware of what was cut out for the theatrical release, so I will concede up front that most of the criticisms about pacing, editing, and missing bits of plot at release were merited.With that caveat out of the way, I must reiterate that this was bar-none the boldest superhero movie I have ever seen. To me, it was arguably the best as well, though \"best\" shouldn't be taken to mean \"most enjoyable.\" That honor easily goes to \"Thor: Ragnarok.\" What makes BvS stand out among other films in the genre is that it takes two characters who have been done to death since the 1970s and brings them up to date. I recently tried to watch \"Superman: The Movie\" for the first time in a number of years, and while it was still good and Reeves will always be iconic, I just couldn't take it seriously. I'll put it this way: If the story in BvS was \"stupid\" in your view but Superman turning back time by spinning the earth backward on its axis didn't seem like one of the dumbest things you have ever seen -in any movie from any genre- to the extent that it outright ruins the movie for you, then your opinion about BvS isn't worth much. Nostalgic bias was always going to be a problem for this movie, and the way people reacted to and reviewed \"Man of Steel\" was telling in this regard.That brings me to Zack Snyder's take on Superman. You know, that guy whose status as the first extraterrestrial ever encountered by humanity was a total non-issue in the old movies. Apparently, Snyder has a similar view to my own in that his take on the Man of Steel makes his being an alien a core piece of his identity. He may look like any other (absurdly attractive) person, but he knows what he is, and that makes him perpetually uncertain of where he fits in this world. He is essentially good and really does care about people, but he struggles to truly empathize with the likes of us. To be human is to be frail, and that is not something he can easily relate to. This is the root of his conflict with Batman.Just as Clark struggles to genuinely relate to most people, Snyder's Batman either refuses to or otherwise just can't relate to Superman. He doesn't see him as anything but a threat regardless of Superman's clear good intentions. Remember, a small group of Kryptonians were able to bring humanity to the brink of extinction in less than a day, and Bruce Wayne is nothing if not a realist. He didn't know the guy from Kansas. He only knew the god from another world.While Batman's anger toward and fear of Superman are readily apparent from the start, Superman's inability to imagine things from Bruce Wayne's perspective only becomes truly apparent during their first real interaction. This reminded me of the animated version of the \"world's finest\" storyline, where Superman judges Batman harshly for using fear tactics and threats of violence (also, actual violence) to get the job done. Superman wasn't willing to consider what it would take for a human man to fight criminals and save innocents, or what that life would do to him over time. Just as Batman didn't see the guy from Kansas, Superman didn't see the man who lives his life trapped in one brutal, unthinkably traumatic moment (this was beautifully conveyed during the film's opening moments), and had spent his whole adult life bearing witness to humanity at its absolute worst.The conflict between these two characters is as old as human history. They want the same things, but they can't understand one another. So they fight. And what a fight it was.Watching a fight between, say, Captain America and Iron Man was, to me, more frustrating than anything because each understood the other's perspective perfectly. The fight between Batman and Superman in BvS was genuinely gut-wrenching, as intended, because they would have understood one another if either had tried. The whole sequence hilighted Batman's tactical prowess and ability to control a situation. Maybe the most badass thing about the fight was that it ended exactly where Batman planned. That brings me to the big elephant in the room named \"Martha.\"I can't recall exactly which YouTuber put it this way, but if you thought the \"save Martha\" exchange was about their mothers having the same name, you had your brain turned off. The brain-on people have explained this to death, but it bears repeating. This was the moment when Superman became humanized to Batman. He was about to die, and his only concern was for his adoptive human mother. He still believed that the man about to take his life would do the right thing. Even with the cowl on, there was no mistaking the look on Batman's face. It was the look of shame, guilt, and sudden uncertainty that says \"What am I doing?\" Turns out even the most brutal, angry version of Bruce Wayne is better than Tony Stark at knowing right from wrong. At knowing that he had gone too far.From there, the third act was a series of truly impressive (albeit mostly CGI) fight sequences, beginning with what I regard as the undisputed champion of Batman fights. Nothing in the Nolan movies (and especially nothing in the Burton movies) even came close. Go ahead, try to convince yourself that Batman and Bane taking turns punching one another in the face until Bane's mask broke was a good fight sequence. No, this was a fight straight out of \"Arkham Knight,\" and it was glorious. The battle against Doomsday really was one for the books. From the moment Wonder Woman arrived accompanied by the intense sounds of Tina Guo's electric cello to Superman's tragic, heroic death at the hands of Doomsday, I was glued to the screen. Sure, the mere presence of Doomsday spoiled the end to a degree, but watching the Man of Steel laboring to carry that kryptonite spear towards certain death was no less impactful. A brief word on Jesse Eisenberg's take on Lex Luthor. At least one other reviewer on this site already said it best when they pointed out that this was his origin story. If you consider his scheme objectively, he is actually one of the more formidable incarnations of the character. If we're lucky, we'll eventually get to see a Snyder Cut of \"Justice League\" and find out where this story was actually meant to go. For the record, Joss Whedon and Danny Elfman both should have said \"no\" to taking a dump on someone else's art."
"BATMAN V SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE brings a fantastic surprise to a smash-hit team-up with one of the worlds most beloved DC Comics' icons of all time. The movie delivers spectacular casting, and fantastic acting with different characters having their shine in each scenes.The story follows Clark Kent/Superman who becomes a threat, after the destruction in Metropolis in Man Of Steel.(2013). Batman/Bruce Wayne sees him as a threat and begins his war on Superman.The movie brings spectacular storytelling, it tells the complications of human against alien who are on the same side, and the first meeting of Batman and Superman. The story of Bruce Wayne, with his many years of The Caped Crusader, sends him on a spiral of \"out of control\", sheer anger, and builds tension to wanting to defeat the Man of Steel. Snyder has fantastically gave this storytelling an exciting nod to the comics.Lex Luthor, played by Jesse Einsberg, delivers a very interesting performance, but very differently by him showing is his \"origin\" before he becomes a bald foe to the Man of Steel. He shows that his love of \"god vs man\" terrorises mankind when he ultimately creates Doomsday, and Batman realises Superman's inner heroism.It packs so many great \"out of nowhere\" excitement, including a first-look of the fearful Wonder Woman a.k.a. Diana Prince, played by Gal Gadot, and a fresh-new glimpse of the superhero DC canon: The Justice League.WATCH THIS MOVIE! The critics are out of their mind. It's a fun-packed action adventure which still keeps the movie enjoyable until it's final minutes of the movie. It's a FANTASTIC MOVIE! BEN AFFLECK AS BATMAN... is Incredible!A 10/10 overall!"
"I want to go on record as saying that this is a truly thrilling cinematic experience in so many ways. If pressed, I guess I could acknowledge that there were a couple ... let's say \"clumsy\" moments. And in a film that runs to three hours, that hardly seems like a significant issue, certainly not enough to rate it with fewer than 9 stars.This film has everything. There is dramatic tension right from the start. There is a magnificent story arc that picks up quite seamlessly from 'Man of Steel' and propels the viewer not only into the life of Clark Kent/Superman but also of Bruce Wayne/Batman.The villain is no mere cartoon of a villain; he is truly thoroughly (and apparently irrevocably) diabolical. He is a psychopath, and you wish for his death over and over and over. You want Superman to reduce him to ash with the power of his eyes.I have read a number of viewers' reviews, and it seems that the people who disliked the film / gave it a low rating had rather unfair and unrealistic expectations of it. That is, their own prejudices about how the plot could/should unfold or what the character development could/should be, etc. ruined the film for them. And that is a shame.My thought is: I settle into my seat, wait for the lights to dim, and then I wait to be transported by the film. I accept it, lock, stock, and barrel.As another reviewer remarked, I love how the film begins from the point of view of Bruce Wayne as he is among people on the ground who have fallen victim to the attack of Zod and the other Kryptonians.Why would Bruce Wayne not like Superman? Why would the good people of Earth hurl insults at Superman and burn him in effigy (on the news)? Because the good people of Earth just got catapulted into a new reality in which there are not only extraterrestrial beings (surprise!) but they are also superman! And a group of them are hell-bent on destroying humankind and taking the planet for themselves.It is difficult to see Superman as separate from the whole Kryptonian Krew.It seems that many moviegoers forgot that Bruce Wayne is also human. Sure, he's a hero, but he is flawed.. Just like the rest of us. He is a vigilante, after all.He has let his vigilantism get the better of him. HE is actually the one working outside the boundaries of the law, not Superman. It is the clear head of Alfred that shows us that he has gone into a rather dark place, that he has not seen what is really going on (in Luthor's scheme), and so he chooses to embark on his own scheme scheme to take out the alien invader. He is (allegedly) thinking of the future: if he wipes out the all-powerful alien, then it can't turn on humankind in the future. At least, he convinces himself of that.A philosophical question is raised in the film: should Clark Kent have remained a simple man from Kansas and never have become the Superman? Should he just let people die and let calamities happen? The question is answered for us in the character of Diana Prince/Wonder Woman. She withdrew from mankind (her exact words) and just sat around watching. Watching while people died horrible deaths all around her. So, should Superman have done the same? Do these special beings, these 'metahumans', have some kind of moral imperative to intervene, or should they be allowed to be regular people, too? It seems that humans want it both ways.It seems that humans are saying: \"Don't be a superalien ... except when I and my friends and family are in trouble. Then come save us.\""

"Batman v Superman: Ultimate Edition: If your looking for a quick, cheap thrill then you might not enjoy this film at the time. This movies theatrical version was butchered by WB and in doing so reshaped the story leaving numerous plot holes. So the Ultimate Edition is the full story and the one worth seeing. Watch 'Man of Steel' before seeing this movie. There is much to claw through here, so much so that the audience might easily find themselves exhausted from the overall aggression of the film. However, a lot of the story does work. The action is good, and the emotion feels real most of the time.This film is about Superman trying to become Superman. Trying to help the world, save people, find a place in this world not as an outcast, and yet is looked at has a threat by many. Superman is not from this world, yet He is trying to be human, find a place in this world, be excepted by earths people, and come into his destiny.This film is also about Batman being Batman for 20 years and losing faith in humanity, and fearing Superman, what Superman can do with his powers. Great film, great plot, great visuals. ---Yidioo"
"I didn't see the film in the theaters and just bought the \"Extended Edition \" on Amazon. I never properly saw Man of Steel- i think I rented it and watched it when already exhausted and fell asleep. I saw the mediocre user reviews and horrible reviews from critics of this film.They really have it wrong. This is the very best either Batman or Superman. It has a different take, on things. Much darker then earlier films even darker then the Christopher Nolan Batman films.First of all Christopher Nolan is an Executive Producer. So how bad could it be? I loved Sucker Punch and Zack Snyder was involved with that. So how bad could this be? Hans Zimmer did the music, so how bad could it be?I remember watching the old Superman TV shows and reading the Superman and Batman comics as a little kid and loved them, but i wouldn't call myself a \"fan boy\" of comic universes, like so many younger people today. As an older adult I will admit my favorite TV show of all time was Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but watched it on DVD only after it had finished. I saw the second of the Dark Knight series in the theater, but the other two, I watched on DVD. They were great, but not my favorite films like so many people. i also loved the first couple Superman and Batman films in the older series. Regardless, i was not waiting with baited breath to see Man of Steel or this one.I'm more of a serious film fan, who can watch Stanley Kubrick films over and over and my favorite films in the last twenty years, are Eyes Wide Shut and Intersteller, both of which i've watched multiple times.So, with that said, take it from me, the critics have this film very wrong, just as critics hated 2001: A Space Odyssey when it first came out. This film will have lasting appreciation.Surprised how much I liked Ben Afleck's Batman. it was hard to get into Henry Cavil's scrawnier looking Superman, but it grew on me. Amy Adams was great as Lois Lane, The Gal Gadol Wonder Women was amazing. Lex Luther was terrific, like Nolan's Joker. Jeremy Irons was the best Alfred ever. Holly Hunter and Diane Lane was good too. The movie had bad reviews but made a billion dollars. Hopefully everyone buys the Ultimate Edition and it breaks sales records and the film is re-appreciated. I have no idea what scenes this Ultimate Edition added, but it is pretty perfect. Now I can't wait for Wonder Woman and the Justice League and as soon as I finish writing this am going to watch Man of Steal. I'm into it now!I can only surmise that the bad reviews stem from too much expectations of the rigid fan boy types and the radical changes in tone, we see in this film.Total masterpiece of cinema, but I have a few criticisms. There are a few hollow scenes of typical Idiot cops and authorities getting everything wrong in a cliché type way and it has a few filler scenes of that type and a few moments here and there that felt rushed and cheesy. Maybe not everything restored into the Ultimate Edition should have been. I wish there had been more Kevin Costner scenes."

"The whole entire Batman V Superman movie was great and yes even though it felt slow to the majority of the people who watched it but to me I enjoyed every part and every scene of Batman V Superman and when it got to the fight scenes both batman VS Superman and the Doomsday fight it brought so much drama, intensity, and epic performances. So with that being said I give this movie a good 10/10 because it really did go to my expectations and it brought a powerful performance and a powerful yet epic introduction to the upcoming Justice League."

"Zack Snyder not only understands the characters but he also understands how to craft a real amazing movie for fans - honestly blew me away (extended cut) Brilliant!Don't believe what the internet is telling you to think - take this from a person who has worked in the comic book industry - this is amazing!"

"When I first wrote a review for this movie a year ago exclaiming my excitement for the film, I had been high off a fresh dose of live-action DC superheroes playing out the beloved comic book stories that I had grown up on. It was all playing out before my eyes and coming to life. After a few months had passed, I began to notice things about the movie that I disliked: little gaps in the story, things that didn't add up, etc. My original rating of a 10 / 10 dropped to an 8 /10. But today it has gone back up to a 10. The extended version of the film not only rectifies the gaps but also silences critics.Many claimed that the movie was too dark or that it just didn't make sense. To those people, I say: \"Pick up a comic book!\" Many of the critics of this particular film were part of the superhero bandwagon that formed when Marvel began its spree of Avengers-related films. In fact, its estimated that over 60% of people who go to see 'superhero' genre films have never picked up a comic book in their life. I would argue that similar numbers could figure to those which view the CW televised DC Universe shows. People complain that DC comics is just too dark but the fact is that these movies are based upon actual comics which are meant to be dark (ex: The Dark Knight Returns, Injustice, etc.). Its like complaining that Game of Thrones (the TV series) sucks because they kill off too many characters. Read the books! Its frustrating to see such a beautiful work of art like Batman V Superman criticized by those ignorant to its universe and its meaning. This movie is in fact a catalyst that opens numerous doorways and leaves true fans in awe of the possibilities for future movies. But regardless of whether or not people choose to educate themselves, this film's DVD/Blu-ray extended version puts the theater release to shame. All of the plot holes and gaps are filled in 30 minutes of extended footage scattered throughout the film. The movie ultimately becomes more complete and people will wish that the movie had shown the full 3 hours of footage in its theatrical debut. As a major DC comics fan, I will of course pick up on things that a comics fan would not, but someone who does not read comics would learn to appreciate this film in its entirety with the extended version. Get your hands on a copy today or find it on Netflix or the internet somewhere!"

"I ignored the bad reviews and watched anyways. This film had a lot to live up to after Civil War was released and I went into this film expecting the worst. It ended up to be the best Superhero film of 2016 to me. One complaint was that this film was more concerned about universe building than telling a great story than Civil War but for me it was the other way around; Civil War felt like a build up to something else and to be honest, I felt that way when I saw the other MCU films. Batman vs Superman however not only had a great story, but it also felt a lot more consistent than Civil War. This film was way more diverse with the cast than the MCU but unlike the MCU, I felt like this film doesn't go overboard with the SJW stuff like the MCU films or The Star Wars Sequel films do. The Visuals were AMAZING, The Score by Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL was AMAZING as well, The Tone is just right as I actually felt for the characters emotionally, The Cinematography kept my eyes glued to the screen, and the script felt really Intelligent and Complex and despite people calling the writing confusing, I was able to piece it together with no problem whatsoever. This film is similar to Empire Strikes back in terms of popularity so over time after the other movies are released, this movie would probably be more popular.This film was way better than I Expected and deserves another chance.

"Its shame to see what critics and marvel fans did to this movie and targeted Zack Snyder for it. I have seen this movie more than 25 times till date. And i enjoy this movie as much as i enjoyed the first time. The fans who have read DC comics, wouldn't be disappointed in this movie. Its dark movie, yes it is. Because the title shows the intense situation at hand. Two superheroes about to rip each other apart for whatever reasons that brought them to this stage. Yes it had to be dark and intense.Only marvel can be stupid enough to show an alien invasion where humans are loosing the battle and the super heroes are cracking jokes while battles as if they are playing ping pong. a person playing Call of Duty game is more serious while playing than the marvel heroes fighting aliens."

"Last week some news came out from somebody online who had claimed to have seen a finished version of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. If you were like me, you've been leery of checking it out because you weren't sure how much might actually be true. Now Zack Snyder has spoken out about the spoiler-filled post, although his response doesn't really clear anything up.In a word, to MTV, he called the post \"hilarious,which might imply that he's saying that it's mostly, if not entirely, untrue. That might be the case, but then again he could have just said it was untrue and he didn't say that. What he did say, however, is that he doesn't like spoilers. While this may seem odd for the director who's most recent trailer appeared to give away the entire movie, Snyder says that's not the case. Even if you've seen the trailer, you can rest easy, as there is much more we have not seen in then finished film. Says Snyder I have the benefit of seeing the movie. It's cool that think it's too much, and I appreciate people not wanting to know, but there's plenty that they don't know. There's a lot of movie that's not in the trailer. In the process of calling the Batman v Superman Reddit review hilarious, Snyder goes on to talk about how he hates it when spoilers come out. The director would much rather that fans see the movie mostly blind. While he understands that some fans may wish to find the answers before hand, he wants his movies to be mysteries going in. If you're, as an audience member, exploring these articles, looking for answers to questions that you have, maybe you're okay with knowing before you go. It's like an individual taste. But like I said, I want people to see the movie without knowing.Spoilers are a topic that mean different things to different people. While most try to avoid them to some degree, the need to solve the mystery is a nearly universal human experience. We have an inclination to want to know the truth, even while also wanting to be surprised. For most of us getting some information is good, but getting all the information is bad, of course, only getting the details that you want can be difficult."
"The theatrical is choppy, poorly edited, hard to follow, with some really good moments mixed in their. The extended is much more fluent and is much easier to follow, it does have a long runtime, which might make it seem a bit dragging on, but if you like long films done right, like Lord of the Rings, you will like this movie as long as you get into the characters and story. Speaking of which, the story starts out perfectly showing Bruce Wayne as a character, and it is very powerful. There are several moments in this movie that are powerful, emotional, and shocking. Characters. Batman is my favorite fictional character of all time, and believe me when I say, Ben Affleck as Batman was perfect, he had the charisma, the anger, and the look of being through some bad stuff Gal Gadot also does perfect as Wonder Woman, but if you want to really see how good she does, go watch the Wonder Woman movie. Henry Call as Superman. I really don't like it when people say Christopher Reeves is better. Don't get me wrong, Reeves does great, but can you imagine him as Superman in this movie? I wouldn't like it. It would be like Adam West playing Batman in The Dark Knight. Henry Cavill does great in this role, I can say everything about him as I said with Ben Affleck. Jesse Eisenberg as Luthor. I thought it was different in a good way. I've heard a criticism for him as being too much like Joker, but is that a bad thing? Joker is my favorite villain, so to see Superman have an enemy that crazy, but still hold the values Luthor needs to be Luthor, I think it is great. The thing I thought this movie was lacking in the first and second acts was humor, at least good humor. If there was more humor, I would've given this movie a ten because it would give a more relaxing feel to the parts that needed it. All in all though, this movie was awesome, it had powerful moments, it was badass, and just plain fun. It had a great story arc and does its job very well."

"*I will be talking about the Ultimate Edition of the film* This was one of the most anticipated CBM of all time. Ever since the arrival and subsequent success of Marvel's The Avengers people have wondered when will DC launch its own cinematic universe, one of the main reasons being the opportunity to finally see titans such as Batman and Superman share the screen together: the ultimate nerd dream. On 2016, the moment finally came for BvS to be released AND.. it performed poorly. Not only did critical reception left a lot to be desired, but fan reactions where surprisingly split after its cinematic debut. People either loved it and called Zack a genius, or hated it and called him a hack. Me, personally, I found myself with middle of the road feelings, for sure, but more leaning towards the negative side with subsequent viewings. The theatrical cut of the film showcased amazing performances, incredible visuals, and action set pieces that seemed like comic book panels come to life, in a good way. However, when it comes to its narrative structure and more technical aspects like editing, the film was seriously flawed. More plot holes than Age of Ultron, questionable character decisions, random editing that lacked cohesion and focus, and forced dramatic moments that lacked any impact because the attempts at character development ranged from limited to nonexistent, especially when it comes to Superman's character. I thought it was a 5/10 movie at best. As such, I was kind of skeptical about the idea of a 30 minute longer version. I say kind of because I know how Zack works. I remember Watchmen being vastly improved with its director's cut, so in a way I was expecting BvS to perform in a similar manner, but I also feared those 30 minutes wold be just there to amplify action and discredit storytelling issues. Oh boy, I'm so glad I was proved wrong. The ultimate cut of the film was infuriating, but not because it was awful, but because it questions the sanity of WB executives and editors and makes you wonder what were they thinking during the editing process. What I got out of the Ultimate Edition was a thought-provoking deconstruction of two very iconic superheroes that gave spotlight to the struggles both of them face when they aren't fighting crime. What I got was an extremely well produced character study on both Batman and Superman in a cynical world, a world dangerously close to our own. We meet Batman as a ruthless, worn out hero that has seen the failure behind his ideals and witnessed some truly horrifying things in his life. Superman, on the other hand, is portrayed as a godlike figure that seeks to do good in the world, but finds himself emotionally conflicted once he realized that every good deed he does leaves behind a trail of destruction (most of it due to Luthor's antics). In my opinion, this is a hugely original approach, one that distances itself from the rest of the competition and delivers a dark, somber, yet relevant superhero movie that understands both characters and gives them real human struggles to deal with. I felt invested in both of them, and hoped that by the end of the film both could find a way to redeem themselves. Their character arcs were very well established during the first two acts of the movie, and by the time we get to the titular climactic battle the emotion behind the jaw-dropping action is intensified. Lex Luthor as a villain was also given more time to develop with this new edition. One of the main criticisms with the original version was the fact that his plan relied too much on conveniences, and the character's mannerisms and mad-scientist attitude was annoying, and that goes without saying his motivations were unclear. Not only do we spend more time understanding his hate for any godlike figure and thus his hatred for Superman, but the added scenes allowed us to witness his entire plan come to fruition. It sells the cold, manipulative, calculating attributes of his comic counterpart. The acting is spot on. Every actor owns his/her role, from Cavill's Superman, to Ben Affleck as Batman, Eisenberg as Luthor, and Gadot as Wonder Woman, whose scenes are brief, but are more than enough to sell the strong and ferocious warrior that she is. Cinematography is stunning, and miles above that of Man of Steel's. And the soundtrack by Zimmer and Junkie XL? Perfect, just perfect. When it comes to flaws, the film still has some of those. The Martha moment, while serving as a pivotal character moment for Batman, felt off in execution, and its understandable that many people got mad at it. If your main complaint about BvS the first time around was its bleak tone and subject matter, this film is still not for you. I understand most were expecting to see the heroes being the most iconic versions of themselves, clashing in an elongated battle and evoking the same feelings The Avengers gave audiences back in 2012. In that sense, the film will remain divisive, but at least I have the comfort of saying that, at the very least, the film is competently made."

"This film was amazing. Ben Affleck was easily the best part of this movie, he brought his a-game as Batman. The chemistry between Affleck & Irons was outstanding. Gal Gadot did a great job as Wonder Woman. The fight between Batman & Superman was awesome. The final fight with Doomsday was outstanding in every way possible. However, there is only one problem with this film and that's Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor. He was sadly missed cast in this role, but then again it's really the fault of Warner Bros. Studios. Overall, this film deliver on almost every level. I highly recommend that you watch the extended version of this film."

"I know I know. I saw it in theaters too, and felt like it could've been so much better. While the Batman element was good, the narrative felt fractured, and the third act was just one long stunt scene. Superman was relegated to a supporting character, and other characters didn't get a chance to shine. And then I chanced on the ultimate cut. Calling it 30 mins of \"extra\" footage is unfair to Zack Snyder because it's exactly these 30 mins that makes the movie a worthy one. What I can say about the theatrical cut is this - It had the blockbuster elements - music, visuals, stunts, CGI. But, it lacked the human elements. The first 20 mins of the movie had it, but not after that. The extended cut in comparison has a flow to the narrative. There are no disjointed scenes, everything flows smoothly, and there's connective tissue. Superman gets to spend some time with his father, and mother. Clark Kent does some investigative journalism. Superman helps the people after the blast. Lois Lane doesn't jump to conclusions, she gets to the bottom of the crime. Lex Luthor apparently had a coherent plan - everything is explained pretty well. Wonder Woman was already good, so there's no change there :) Also, the \"Martha\" scene seems better executed, because it is a few seconds longer, and there's time to breathe it in. So, here's my take on this movie - The theatrical cut was junk. Get the Bluray for ultimate edition, and you shall not be disappointed. I've seen it so many more times now, and it's the definitive cut. It is the movie we deserve. It's a unique take on Batman, and Superman. It's a gritty take on the superhero movie genre, and definitely the best DCEU movie, and the best DC movie since The Dark Knight.P.S. Yes it's dark. We're adults, and we should appreciate mature film making without intentionally silly moments. It attempts to be philosophical, and something deep instead of just trying to make you chuckle."

"This is one of the best superhero movies ever made. Zack Snyder is a magician behind the camera.The reason behind so many complaints is the fact that Warner Bros. marketed this movie as a fight between Batman and Superman. That's not what it is. It's a movie about the origins of the Justice League.The cinematography, the acting and the score are all second to none. This film is phenomenal.P.S: watch the 3 hour extended cut that Snyder intended you to see, not the 2 and a half hour movie that Warner Bros. decided would be better for theaters."

"I don't care what the critics say, this is a very well-done movie. I'll start my review by listing what I like about the movie.1.) Ben Affleck is the best batman to me and it is not close. He pulls off the role of an aging batman extremely well. Also, Zack Snyder's vision of batman is legit. I have always hated batman up until this adaptation of him. Instead of being a conflicted and idealistic batman, this batman is dark, gritty, and 100% a badass. His equipment is decked out with machine guns and he has no aversion to killing people. In fact, he probably kills about 50 criminal by the time this movie is over. The warehouse scene is the coolest batman scene in any movie.2.) The development of a grudge between batman and superman is pulled off flawlessly. It actually makes sense why batman dislikes superman. Then, when they do fight it is about the coolest thing you can expect to see from a superhero film. 3.) I disagree with a lot of people about Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor. In my opinion, he played his role to perfection. 4.) B v S sets up Wonder Woman and Justice League with Gal Gadot's cameo as Wonder Woman and short clips of Aquaman, the Flash, and Cyborg. B v S is one of my favorite superhero films and rewatching it never gets old."

"The theatrical cut of this film is garbage which is why I rated it eight stars instead of nine. The first time I watched this film I didn't like it (not straight out hate but didn't like). Character motivations didn't make any sense, Lex was annoying as s***, editing was sloppy, and it was overly dark and broody for an action superhero movie. A year + a half, five Marvel films, a ton of bad reviews and a Justice League later a thought popped into my head: \"what if I watched BVS again\". This time I didn't have trailers ruining the best moments, I only vaguely remembered the film, and I was conditioned to look at it negatively but something unexpected happened: I actually loved it. Superman was just a normal person that tried to make a difference cause he could that others imposed their own beliefs on. Lex Luthor was a genius that couldn't stand his powerlessness compared to Superman or more accurately a super being. As Alfred said \"The fever, the rage, the feeling of powerlessness that turns good men... cruel\" and you see the same thought process in Batman. Batman, just like Lex Luthor feels powerless in the midst of a god-being and just like Lex he attempts to destroy him so he can get his sense of power back but unlike Lex, Batman learns something. I what is one of the corniest lines of the movie Superman says, \"Martha\" when he knows he can't win against Batman in a late desperate attempt to save his mother. Not only does this name connect with Bruce Wayne but it also shows what really matters to a man of steel: it isn't power, it isn't fame or anything else, it is his Mother and on a broader scale it is people. Lex (who doesn't care about people at all) knows he doesn't have the power so he creates something from his blood and the remains of Zod: A Doomsday for Superman. Not only does this film have depth but it also doesn't always explain it to you which is rare in a blockbuster action superhero flick normally cater to semi-comic book fans and people that want to shove popcorn in their mouths. This film rewards you for really noticing the details while still having massive explosions. One of my favorites is how Lex has all of Batman's branded killed which is why he isn't afraid of the branding at the end or Grandma's Peach Tea as a way of scaring the s*** out of someone. Of course, this film isn't perfect and I do have personal dislikes. The Batman V Superman fight was slow and pretty boring especially after watching such an amazing fight in Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 2 (If you haven't watched the animated Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 1 and 2 you are sorely missing out on something fantastic). Also, the addition of Wonder Woman who pretty much steals a hacker thing, gives it back and then suits up and fights against a giant monster thing. Not to say I don't like Wonder Woman (She is one of my favorite Superheroes of all time who showed not only can woman kick a** but they also don't need to be ashamed of their sexuality or gender) but she wasn't really that helpful to the plot and just brought in to expand the universe which was well done through Lex's superhuman hunting files. Also, the post-apocalyptic scene that was just a dream could have been cut but nothing is perfect except movies like Citizen Kane which isn't a lot of fun to watch cause it is too perfect. So to summarize, the theatrical cut is bad, the ultimate cut is Amazing and the other cut is meh. Please give it a second chance because it deserves it and save a good director from losing grace because of something he didn't do."
"I really liked it, don't know what all the hate is about. I'm actually a Marvel fan from when I was 7 or so, but Superman and Batman together in 1 movie? Just great. And personally I like Ben Affleck even better than Christian Bale as Batman. So just watch and enjoy, I know I did!"

"That's right. We have been waiting for these two heroes to finally meet and fight against each other. This movie is so good in both plot and special effects.Henry Cavill and Ben Affleck have performed well in their acting stages. They are the best superhero actors and they have filmed their fighting scenes very well. The movie starts to show the conflict between the lives of the heroes and now they have blamed each other for it. This movie is amazing and sets up a good plot for Dawn Justice."

"Actually...I didn't know what to expect. When you see Wonder Woman, you know it will be off of Wonder Woman and off of a Wonder Woman story, but with Batman V Superman, I was like, \"hmmmm, so who is this about?\" It was pretty obvious that it would feature many characters, but I thought the introduction to Batman was amazing. Ben Affleck nailed the part, not only as Batman but also as Bruce Wayne. He is my Batman. Henry Cavill continued to be super as the Man of Steel. And he is my Super - Man. A dark story? Yes, without a doubt. Could it have had a few more jokes? Sure. But not all movies or stories need to have jokes when certain events are serious. I really hope people can see this review and take another look at the movie, because, I loved it. I really hope the ratings can go up, eventually. And P.S, this movie is the perfect set up to Justice League."

"This film is crucial to the extended universe that DC is trying to build, but it feels highly derivative of better stories and continues to demonstrate the misuse of the iconic characters mentioned in the title. Plus Jesse Eisenberg feels wildly mis-casted."

"I'll start by making it clear I have only ever seen the Ultimate Edition. I'm aware of what was cut out for the theatrical release, so I will concede up front that most of the criticisms about pacing, editing, and missing bits of plot at release were merited.With that caveat out of the way, I must reiterate that this was bar-none the boldest superhero movie I have ever seen. To me, it was arguably the best as well, though \"best\" shouldn't be taken to mean \"most enjoyable.\" That honor easily goes to \"Thor: Ragnarok.\" What makes BvS stand out among other films in the genre is that it takes two characters who have been done to death since the 1970s and brings them up to date. I recently tried to watch \"Superman: The Movie\" for the first time in a number of years, and while it was still good and Reeves will always be iconic, I just couldn't take it seriously. I'll put it this way: If the story in BvS was \"stupid\" in your view but Superman turning back time by spinning the earth backward on its axis didn't seem like one of the dumbest things you have ever seen -in any movie from any genre- to the extent that it outright ruins the movie for you, then your opinion about BvS isn't worth much. Nostalgic bias was always going to be a problem for this movie, and the way people reacted to and reviewed \"Man of Steel\" was telling in this regard.That brings me to Zack Snyder's take on Superman. You know, that guy whose status as the first extraterrestrial ever encountered by humanity was a total non-issue in the old movies. Apparently, Snyder has a similar view to my own in that his take on the Man of Steel makes his being an alien a core piece of his identity. He may look like any other (absurdly attractive) person, but he knows what he is, and that makes him perpetually uncertain of where he fits in this world. He is essentially good and really does care about people, but he struggles to truly empathize with the likes of us. To be human is to be frail, and that is not something he can easily relate to. This is the root of his conflict with Batman.Just as Clark struggles to genuinely relate to most people, Snyder's Batman either refuses to or otherwise just can't relate to Superman. He doesn't see him as anything but a threat regardless of Superman's clear good intentions. Remember, a small group of Kryptonians were able to bring humanity to the brink of extinction in less than a day, and Bruce Wayne is nothing if not a realist. He didn't know the guy from Kansas. He only knew the god from another world.While Batman's anger toward and fear of Superman are readily apparent from the start, Superman's inability to imagine things from Bruce Wayne's perspective only becomes truly apparent during their first real interaction. This reminded me of the animated version of the \"world's finest\" storyline, where Superman judges Batman harshly for using fear tactics and threats of violence (also, actual violence) to get the job done. Superman wasn't willing to consider what it would take for a human man to fight criminals and save innocents, or what that life would do to him over time. Just as Batman didn't see the guy from Kansas, Superman didn't see the man who lives his life trapped in one brutal, unthinkably traumatic moment (this was beautifully conveyed during the film's opening moments), and had spent his whole adult life bearing witness to humanity at its absolute worst.The conflict between these two characters is as old as human history. They want the same things, but they can't understand one another. So they fight. And what a fight it was.Watching a fight between, say, Captain America and Iron Man was, to me, more frustrating than anything because each understood the other's perspective perfectly. The fight between Batman and Superman in BvS was genuinely gut-wrenching, as intended, because they would have understood one another if either had tried. The whole sequence hilighted Batman's tactical prowess and ability to control a situation. Maybe the most badass thing about the fight was that it ended exactly where Batman planned. That brings me to the big elephant in the room named \"Martha.\"I can't recall exactly which YouTuber put it this way, but if you thought the \"save Martha\" exchange was about their mothers having the same name, you had your brain turned off. The brain-on people have explained this to death, but it bears repeating. This was the moment when Superman became humanized to Batman. He was about to die, and his only concern was for his adoptive human mother. He still believed that the man about to take his life would do the right thing. Even with the cowl on, there was no mistaking the look on Batman's face. It was the look of shame, guilt, and sudden uncertainty that says \"What am I doing?\" Turns out even the most brutal, angry version of Bruce Wayne is better than Tony Stark at knowing right from wrong. At knowing that he had gone too far.From there, the third act was a series of truly impressive (albeit mostly CGI) fight sequences, beginning with what I regard as the undisputed champion of Batman fights. Nothing in the Nolan movies (and especially nothing in the Burton movies) even came close. Go ahead, try to convince yourself that Batman and Bane taking turns punching one another in the face until Bane's mask broke was a good fight sequence. No, this was a fight straight out of \"Arkham Knight,\" and it was glorious. The battle against Doomsday really was one for the books. From the moment Wonder Woman arrived accompanied by the intense sounds of Tina Guo's electric cello to Superman's tragic, heroic death at the hands of Doomsday, I was glued to the screen. Sure, the mere presence of Doomsday spoiled the end to a degree, but watching the Man of Steel laboring to carry that kryptonite spear towards certain death was no less impactful. A brief word on Jesse Eisenberg's take on Lex Luthor. At least one other reviewer on this site already said it best when they pointed out that this was his origin story. If you consider his scheme objectively, he is actually one of the more formidable incarnations of the character. If we're lucky, we'll eventually get to see a Snyder Cut of \"Justice League\" and find out where this story was actually meant to go. For the record, Joss Whedon and Danny Elfman both should have said \"no\" to taking a dump on someone else's art."
"BATMAN V SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE brings a fantastic surprise to a smash-hit team-up with one of the worlds most beloved DC Comics' icons of all time. The movie delivers spectacular casting, and fantastic acting with different characters having their shine in each scenes.The story follows Clark Kent/Superman who becomes a threat, after the destruction in Metropolis in Man Of Steel.(2013). Batman/Bruce Wayne sees him as a threat and begins his war on Superman.The movie brings spectacular storytelling, it tells the complications of human against alien who are on the same side, and the first meeting of Batman and Superman. The story of Bruce Wayne, with his many years of The Caped Crusader, sends him on a spiral of \"out of control\", sheer anger, and builds tension to wanting to defeat the Man of Steel. Snyder has fantastically gave this storytelling an exciting nod to the comics.Lex Luthor, played by Jesse Einsberg, delivers a very interesting performance, but very differently by him showing is his \"origin\" before he becomes a bald foe to the Man of Steel. He shows that his love of \"god vs man\" terrorises mankind when he ultimately creates Doomsday, and Batman realises Superman's inner heroism.It packs so many great \"out of nowhere\" excitement, including a first-look of the fearful Wonder Woman a.k.a. Diana Prince, played by Gal Gadot, and a fresh-new glimpse of the superhero DC canon: The Justice League.WATCH THIS MOVIE! The critics are out of their mind. It's a fun-packed action adventure which still keeps the movie enjoyable until it's final minutes of the movie. It's a FANTASTIC MOVIE! BEN AFFLECK AS BATMAN... is Incredible!A 10/10 overall!"
"I want to go on record as saying that this is a truly thrilling cinematic experience in so many ways. If pressed, I guess I could acknowledge that there were a couple ... let's say \"clumsy\" moments. And in a film that runs to three hours, that hardly seems like a significant issue, certainly not enough to rate it with fewer than 9 stars.This film has everything. There is dramatic tension right from the start. There is a magnificent story arc that picks up quite seamlessly from 'Man of Steel' and propels the viewer not only into the life of Clark Kent/Superman but also of Bruce Wayne/Batman.The villain is no mere cartoon of a villain; he is truly thoroughly (and apparently irrevocably) diabolical. He is a psychopath, and you wish for his death over and over and over. You want Superman to reduce him to ash with the power of his eyes.I have read a number of viewers' reviews, and it seems that the people who disliked the film / gave it a low rating had rather unfair and unrealistic expectations of it. That is, their own prejudices about how the plot could/should unfold or what the character development could/should be, etc. ruined the film for them. And that is a shame.My thought is: I settle into my seat, wait for the lights to dim, and then I wait to be transported by the film. I accept it, lock, stock, and barrel.As another reviewer remarked, I love how the film begins from the point of view of Bruce Wayne as he is among people on the ground who have fallen victim to the attack of Zod and the other Kryptonians.Why would Bruce Wayne not like Superman? Why would the good people of Earth hurl insults at Superman and burn him in effigy (on the news)? Because the good people of Earth just got catapulted into a new reality in which there are not only extraterrestrial beings (surprise!) but they are also superman! And a group of them are hell-bent on destroying humankind and taking the planet for themselves.It is difficult to see Superman as separate from the whole Kryptonian Krew.It seems that many moviegoers forgot that Bruce Wayne is also human. Sure, he's a hero, but he is flawed.. Just like the rest of us. He is a vigilante, after all.He has let his vigilantism get the better of him. HE is actually the one working outside the boundaries of the law, not Superman. It is the clear head of Alfred that shows us that he has gone into a rather dark place, that he has not seen what is really going on (in Luthor's scheme), and so he chooses to embark on his own scheme scheme to take out the alien invader. He is (allegedly) thinking of the future: if he wipes out the all-powerful alien, then it can't turn on humankind in the future. At least, he convinces himself of that.A philosophical question is raised in the film: should Clark Kent have remained a simple man from Kansas and never have become the Superman? Should he just let people die and let calamities happen? The question is answered for us in the character of Diana Prince/Wonder Woman. She withdrew from mankind (her exact words) and just sat around watching. Watching while people died horrible deaths all around her. So, should Superman have done the same? Do these special beings, these 'metahumans', have some kind of moral imperative to intervene, or should they be allowed to be regular people, too? It seems that humans want it both ways.It seems that humans are saying: \"Don't be a superalien ... except when I and my friends and family are in trouble. Then come save us.\""

"Batman v Superman: Ultimate Edition: If your looking for a quick, cheap thrill then you might not enjoy this film at the time. This movies theatrical version was butchered by WB and in doing so reshaped the story leaving numerous plot holes. So the Ultimate Edition is the full story and the one worth seeing. Watch 'Man of Steel' before seeing this movie. There is much to claw through here, so much so that the audience might easily find themselves exhausted from the overall aggression of the film. However, a lot of the story does work. The action is good, and the emotion feels real most of the time.This film is about Superman trying to become Superman. Trying to help the world, save people, find a place in this world not as an outcast, and yet is looked at has a threat by many. Superman is not from this world, yet He is trying to be human, find a place in this world, be excepted by earths people, and come into his destiny.This film is also about Batman being Batman for 20 years and losing faith in humanity, and fearing Superman, what Superman can do with his powers. Great film, great plot, great visuals. ---Yidioo"
"I didn't see the film in the theaters and just bought the \"Extended Edition \" on Amazon. I never properly saw Man of Steel- i think I rented it and watched it when already exhausted and fell asleep. I saw the mediocre user reviews and horrible reviews from critics of this film.They really have it wrong. This is the very best either Batman or Superman. It has a different take, on things. Much darker then earlier films even darker then the Christopher Nolan Batman films.First of all Christopher Nolan is an Executive Producer. So how bad could it be? I loved Sucker Punch and Zack Snyder was involved with that. So how bad could this be? Hans Zimmer did the music, so how bad could it be?I remember watching the old Superman TV shows and reading the Superman and Batman comics as a little kid and loved them, but i wouldn't call myself a \"fan boy\" of comic universes, like so many younger people today. As an older adult I will admit my favorite TV show of all time was Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but watched it on DVD only after it had finished. I saw the second of the Dark Knight series in the theater, but the other two, I watched on DVD. They were great, but not my favorite films like so many people. i also loved the first couple Superman and Batman films in the older series. Regardless, i was not waiting with baited breath to see Man of Steel or this one.I'm more of a serious film fan, who can watch Stanley Kubrick films over and over and my favorite films in the last twenty years, are Eyes Wide Shut and Intersteller, both of which i've watched multiple times.So, with that said, take it from me, the critics have this film very wrong, just as critics hated 2001: A Space Odyssey when it first came out. This film will have lasting appreciation.Surprised how much I liked Ben Afleck's Batman. it was hard to get into Henry Cavil's scrawnier looking Superman, but it grew on me. Amy Adams was great as Lois Lane, The Gal Gadol Wonder Women was amazing. Lex Luther was terrific, like Nolan's Joker. Jeremy Irons was the best Alfred ever. Holly Hunter and Diane Lane was good too. The movie had bad reviews but made a billion dollars. Hopefully everyone buys the Ultimate Edition and it breaks sales records and the film is re-appreciated. I have no idea what scenes this Ultimate Edition added, but it is pretty perfect. Now I can't wait for Wonder Woman and the Justice League and as soon as I finish writing this am going to watch Man of Steal. I'm into it now!I can only surmise that the bad reviews stem from too much expectations of the rigid fan boy types and the radical changes in tone, we see in this film.Total masterpiece of cinema, but I have a few criticisms. There are a few hollow scenes of typical Idiot cops and authorities getting everything wrong in a cliché type way and it has a few filler scenes of that type and a few moments here and there that felt rushed and cheesy. Maybe not everything restored into the Ultimate Edition should have been. I wish there had been more Kevin Costner scenes."

"The whole entire Batman V Superman movie was great and yes even though it felt slow to the majority of the people who watched it but to me I enjoyed every part and every scene of Batman V Superman and when it got to the fight scenes both batman VS Superman and the Doomsday fight it brought so much drama, intensity, and epic performances. So with that being said I give this movie a good 10/10 because it really did go to my expectations and it brought a powerful performance and a powerful yet epic introduction to the upcoming Justice League."

"When I first wrote a review for this movie a year ago exclaiming my excitement for the film, I had been high off a fresh dose of live-action DC superheroes playing out the beloved comic book stories that I had grown up on. It was all playing out before my eyes and coming to life. After a few months had passed, I began to notice things about the movie that I disliked: little gaps in the story, things that didn't add up, etc. My original rating of a 10 / 10 dropped to an 8 /10. But today it has gone back up to a 10. The extended version of the film not only rectifies the gaps but also silences critics.Many claimed that the movie was too dark or that it just didn't make sense. To those people, I say: \"Pick up a comic book!\" Many of the critics of this particular film were part of the superhero bandwagon that formed when Marvel began its spree of Avengers-related films. In fact, its estimated that over 60% of people who go to see 'superhero' genre films have never picked up a comic book in their life. I would argue that similar numbers could figure to those which view the CW televised DC Universe shows. People complain that DC comics is just too dark but the fact is that these movies are based upon actual comics which are meant to be dark (ex: The Dark Knight Returns, Injustice, etc.). Its like complaining that Game of Thrones (the TV series) sucks because they kill off too many characters. Read the books! Its frustrating to see such a beautiful work of art like Batman V Superman criticized by those ignorant to its universe and its meaning. This movie is in fact a catalyst that opens numerous doorways and leaves true fans in awe of the possibilities for future movies. But regardless of whether or not people choose to educate themselves, this film's DVD/Blu-ray extended version puts the theater release to shame. All of the plot holes and gaps are filled in 30 minutes of extended footage scattered throughout the film. The movie ultimately becomes more complete and people will wish that the movie had shown the full 3 hours of footage in its theatrical debut. As a major DC comics fan, I will of course pick up on things that a comics fan would not, but someone who does not read comics would learn to appreciate this film in its entirety with the extended version. Get your hands on a copy today or find it on Netflix or the internet somewhere!"

"I ignored the bad reviews and watched anyways. This film had a lot to live up to after Civil War was released and I went into this film expecting the worst. It ended up to be the best Superhero film of 2016 to me. One complaint was that this film was more concerned about universe building than telling a great story than Civil War but for me it was the other way around; Civil War felt like a build up to something else and to be honest, I felt that way when I saw the other MCU films. Batman vs Superman however not only had a great story, but it also felt a lot more consistent than Civil War. This film was way more diverse with the cast than the MCU but unlike the MCU, I felt like this film doesn't go overboard with the SJW stuff like the MCU films or The Star Wars Sequel films do. The Visuals were AMAZING, The Score by Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL was AMAZING as well, The Tone is just right as I actually felt for the characters emotionally, The Cinematography kept my eyes glued to the screen, and the script felt really Intelligent and Complex and despite people calling the writing confusing, I was able to piece it together with no problem whatsoever. This film is similar to Empire Strikes back in terms of popularity so over time after the other movies are released, this movie would probably be more popular.This film was way better than I Expected and deserves another chance.

"Its shame to see what critics and marvel fans did to this movie and targeted Zack Snyder for it. I have seen this movie more than 25 times till date. And i enjoy this movie as much as i enjoyed the first time. The fans who have read DC comics, wouldn't be disappointed in this movie. Its dark movie, yes it is. Because the title shows the intense situation at hand. Two superheroes about to rip each other apart for whatever reasons that brought them to this stage. Yes it had to be dark and intense.Only marvel can be stupid enough to show an alien invasion where humans are loosing the battle and the super heroes are cracking jokes while battles as if they are playing ping pong. a person playing Call of Duty game is more serious while playing than the marvel heroes fighting aliens."

"Last week some news came out from somebody online who had claimed to have seen a finished version of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. If you were like me, you've been leery of checking it out because you weren't sure how much might actually be true. Now Zack Snyder has spoken out about the spoiler-filled post, although his response doesn't really clear anything up.In a word, to MTV, he called the post \"hilarious,which might imply that he's saying that it's mostly, if not entirely, untrue. That might be the case, but then again he could have just said it was untrue and he didn't say that. What he did say, however, is that he doesn't like spoilers. While this may seem odd for the director who's most recent trailer appeared to give away the entire movie, Snyder says that's not the case. Even if you've seen the trailer, you can rest easy, as there is much more we have not seen in then finished film. Says Snyder I have the benefit of seeing the movie. It's cool that think it's too much, and I appreciate people not wanting to know, but there's plenty that they don't know. There's a lot of movie that's not in the trailer. In the process of calling the Batman v Superman Reddit review hilarious, Snyder goes on to talk about how he hates it when spoilers come out. The director would much rather that fans see the movie mostly blind. While he understands that some fans may wish to find the answers before hand, he wants his movies to be mysteries going in. If you're, as an audience member, exploring these articles, looking for answers to questions that you have, maybe you're okay with knowing before you go. It's like an individual taste. But like I said, I want people to see the movie without knowing.Spoilers are a topic that mean different things to different people. While most try to avoid them to some degree, the need to solve the mystery is a nearly universal human experience. We have an inclination to want to know the truth, even while also wanting to be surprised. For most of us getting some information is good, but getting all the information is bad, of course, only getting the details that you want can be difficult."
"The theatrical is choppy, poorly edited, hard to follow, with some really good moments mixed in their. The extended is much more fluent and is much easier to follow, it does have a long runtime, which might make it seem a bit dragging on, but if you like long films done right, like Lord of the Rings, you will like this movie as long as you get into the characters and story. Speaking of which, the story starts out perfectly showing Bruce Wayne as a character, and it is very powerful. There are several moments in this movie that are powerful, emotional, and shocking. Characters. Batman is my favorite fictional character of all time, and believe me when I say, Ben Affleck as Batman was perfect, he had the charisma, the anger, and the look of being through some bad stuff Gal Gadot also does perfect as Wonder Woman, but if you want to really see how good she does, go watch the Wonder Woman movie. Henry Call as Superman. I really don't like it when people say Christopher Reeves is better. Don't get me wrong, Reeves does great, but can you imagine him as Superman in this movie? I wouldn't like it. It would be like Adam West playing Batman in The Dark Knight. Henry Cavill does great in this role, I can say everything about him as I said with Ben Affleck. Jesse Eisenberg as Luthor. I thought it was different in a good way. I've heard a criticism for him as being too much like Joker, but is that a bad thing? Joker is my favorite villain, so to see Superman have an enemy that crazy, but still hold the values Luthor needs to be Luthor, I think it is great. The thing I thought this movie was lacking in the first and second acts was humor, at least good humor. If there was more humor, I would've given this movie a ten because it would give a more relaxing feel to the parts that needed it. All in all though, this movie was awesome, it had powerful moments, it was badass, and just plain fun. It had a great story arc and does its job very well."

"*I will be talking about the Ultimate Edition of the film* This was one of the most anticipated CBM of all time. Ever since the arrival and subsequent success of Marvel's The Avengers people have wondered when will DC launch its own cinematic universe, one of the main reasons being the opportunity to finally see titans such as Batman and Superman share the screen together: the ultimate nerd dream. On 2016, the moment finally came for BvS to be released AND.. it performed poorly. Not only did critical reception left a lot to be desired, but fan reactions where surprisingly split after its cinematic debut. People either loved it and called Zack a genius, or hated it and called him a hack. Me, personally, I found myself with middle of the road feelings, for sure, but more leaning towards the negative side with subsequent viewings. The theatrical cut of the film showcased amazing performances, incredible visuals, and action set pieces that seemed like comic book panels come to life, in a good way. However, when it comes to its narrative structure and more technical aspects like editing, the film was seriously flawed. More plot holes than Age of Ultron, questionable character decisions, random editing that lacked cohesion and focus, and forced dramatic moments that lacked any impact because the attempts at character development ranged from limited to nonexistent, especially when it comes to Superman's character. I thought it was a 5/10 movie at best. As such, I was kind of skeptical about the idea of a 30 minute longer version. I say kind of because I know how Zack works. I remember Watchmen being vastly improved with its director's cut, so in a way I was expecting BvS to perform in a similar manner, but I also feared those 30 minutes wold be just there to amplify action and discredit storytelling issues. Oh boy, I'm so glad I was proved wrong. The ultimate cut of the film was infuriating, but not because it was awful, but because it questions the sanity of WB executives and editors and makes you wonder what were they thinking during the editing process. What I got out of the Ultimate Edition was a thought-provoking deconstruction of two very iconic superheroes that gave spotlight to the struggles both of them face when they aren't fighting crime. What I got was an extremely well produced character study on both Batman and Superman in a cynical world, a world dangerously close to our own. We meet Batman as a ruthless, worn out hero that has seen the failure behind his ideals and witnessed some truly horrifying things in his life. Superman, on the other hand, is portrayed as a godlike figure that seeks to do good in the world, but finds himself emotionally conflicted once he realized that every good deed he does leaves behind a trail of destruction (most of it due to Luthor's antics). In my opinion, this is a hugely original approach, one that distances itself from the rest of the competition and delivers a dark, somber, yet relevant superhero movie that understands both characters and gives them real human struggles to deal with. I felt invested in both of them, and hoped that by the end of the film both could find a way to redeem themselves. Their character arcs were very well established during the first two acts of the movie, and by the time we get to the titular climactic battle the emotion behind the jaw-dropping action is intensified. Lex Luthor as a villain was also given more time to develop with this new edition. One of the main criticisms with the original version was the fact that his plan relied too much on conveniences, and the character's mannerisms and mad-scientist attitude was annoying, and that goes without saying his motivations were unclear. Not only do we spend more time understanding his hate for any godlike figure and thus his hatred for Superman, but the added scenes allowed us to witness his entire plan come to fruition. It sells the cold, manipulative, calculating attributes of his comic counterpart. The acting is spot on. Every actor owns his/her role, from Cavill's Superman, to Ben Affleck as Batman, Eisenberg as Luthor, and Gadot as Wonder Woman, whose scenes are brief, but are more than enough to sell the strong and ferocious warrior that she is. Cinematography is stunning, and miles above that of Man of Steel's. And the soundtrack by Zimmer and Junkie XL? Perfect, just perfect. When it comes to flaws, the film still has some of those. The Martha moment, while serving as a pivotal character moment for Batman, felt off in execution, and its understandable that many people got mad at it. If your main complaint about BvS the first time around was its bleak tone and subject matter, this film is still not for you. I understand most were expecting to see the heroes being the most iconic versions of themselves, clashing in an elongated battle and evoking the same feelings The Avengers gave audiences back in 2012. In that sense, the film will remain divisive, but at least I have the comfort of saying that, at the very least, the film is competently made."

"This film was amazing. Ben Affleck was easily the best part of this movie, he brought his a-game as Batman. The chemistry between Affleck & Irons was outstanding. Gal Gadot did a great job as Wonder Woman. The fight between Batman & Superman was awesome. The final fight with Doomsday was outstanding in every way possible. However, there is only one problem with this film and that's Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor. He was sadly missed cast in this role, but then again it's really the fault of Warner Bros. Studios. Overall, this film deliver on almost every level. I highly recommend that you watch the extended version of this film."

"I know I know. I saw it in theaters too, and felt like it could've been so much better. While the Batman element was good, the narrative felt fractured, and the third act was just one long stunt scene. Superman was relegated to a supporting character, and other characters didn't get a chance to shine. And then I chanced on the ultimate cut. Calling it 30 mins of \"extra\" footage is unfair to Zack Snyder because it's exactly these 30 mins that makes the movie a worthy one. What I can say about the theatrical cut is this - It had the blockbuster elements - music, visuals, stunts, CGI. But, it lacked the human elements. The first 20 mins of the movie had it, but not after that. The extended cut in comparison has a flow to the narrative. There are no disjointed scenes, everything flows smoothly, and there's connective tissue. Superman gets to spend some time with his father, and mother. Clark Kent does some investigative journalism. Superman helps the people after the blast. Lois Lane doesn't jump to conclusions, she gets to the bottom of the crime. Lex Luthor apparently had a coherent plan - everything is explained pretty well. Wonder Woman was already good, so there's no change there :) Also, the \"Martha\" scene seems better executed, because it is a few seconds longer, and there's time to breathe it in. So, here's my take on this movie - The theatrical cut was junk. Get the Bluray for ultimate edition, and you shall not be disappointed. I've seen it so many more times now, and it's the definitive cut. It is the movie we deserve. It's a unique take on Batman, and Superman. It's a gritty take on the superhero movie genre, and definitely the best DCEU movie, and the best DC movie since The Dark Knight.P.S. Yes it's dark. We're adults, and we should appreciate mature film making without intentionally silly moments. It attempts to be philosophical, and something deep instead of just trying to make you chuckle."

"This is one of the best superhero movies ever made. Zack Snyder is a magician behind the camera.The reason behind so many complaints is the fact that Warner Bros. marketed this movie as a fight between Batman and Superman. That's not what it is. It's a movie about the origins of the Justice League.The cinematography, the acting and the score are all second to none. This film is phenomenal.P.S: watch the 3 hour extended cut that Snyder intended you to see, not the 2 and a half hour movie that Warner Bros. decided would be better for theaters."

"I don't care what the critics say, this is a very well-done movie. I'll start my review by listing what I like about the movie.1.) Ben Affleck is the best batman to me and it is not close. He pulls off the role of an aging batman extremely well. Also, Zack Snyder's vision of batman is legit. I have always hated batman up until this adaptation of him. Instead of being a conflicted and idealistic batman, this batman is dark, gritty, and 100% a badass. His equipment is decked out with machine guns and he has no aversion to killing people. In fact, he probably kills about 50 criminal by the time this movie is over. The warehouse scene is the coolest batman scene in any movie.2.) The development of a grudge between batman and superman is pulled off flawlessly. It actually makes sense why batman dislikes superman. Then, when they do fight it is about the coolest thing you can expect to see from a superhero film. 3.) I disagree with a lot of people about Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor. In my opinion, he played his role to perfection. 4.) B v S sets up Wonder Woman and Justice League with Gal Gadot's cameo as Wonder Woman and short clips of Aquaman, the Flash, and Cyborg. B v S is one of my favorite superhero films and rewatching it never gets old."

"The theatrical cut of this film is garbage which is why I rated it eight stars instead of nine. The first time I watched this film I didn't like it (not straight out hate but didn't like). Character motivations didn't make any sense, Lex was annoying as s***, editing was sloppy, and it was overly dark and broody for an action superhero movie. A year + a half, five Marvel films, a ton of bad reviews and a Justice League later a thought popped into my head: \"what if I watched BVS again\". This time I didn't have trailers ruining the best moments, I only vaguely remembered the film, and I was conditioned to look at it negatively but something unexpected happened: I actually loved it. Superman was just a normal person that tried to make a difference cause he could that others imposed their own beliefs on. Lex Luthor was a genius that couldn't stand his powerlessness compared to Superman or more accurately a super being. As Alfred said \"The fever, the rage, the feeling of powerlessness that turns good men... cruel\" and you see the same thought process in Batman. Batman, just like Lex Luthor feels powerless in the midst of a god-being and just like Lex he attempts to destroy him so he can get his sense of power back but unlike Lex, Batman learns something. I what is one of the corniest lines of the movie Superman says, \"Martha\" when he knows he can't win against Batman in a late desperate attempt to save his mother. Not only does this name connect with Bruce Wayne but it also shows what really matters to a man of steel: it isn't power, it isn't fame or anything else, it is his Mother and on a broader scale it is people. Lex (who doesn't care about people at all) knows he doesn't have the power so he creates something from his blood and the remains of Zod: A Doomsday for Superman. Not only does this film have depth but it also doesn't always explain it to you which is rare in a blockbuster action superhero flick normally cater to semi-comic book fans and people that want to shove popcorn in their mouths. This film rewards you for really noticing the details while still having massive explosions. One of my favorites is how Lex has all of Batman's branded killed which is why he isn't afraid of the branding at the end or Grandma's Peach Tea as a way of scaring the s*** out of someone. Of course, this film isn't perfect and I do have personal dislikes. The Batman V Superman fight was slow and pretty boring especially after watching such an amazing fight in Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 2 (If you haven't watched the animated Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 1 and 2 you are sorely missing out on something fantastic). Also, the addition of Wonder Woman who pretty much steals a hacker thing, gives it back and then suits up and fights against a giant monster thing. Not to say I don't like Wonder Woman (She is one of my favorite Superheroes of all time who showed not only can woman kick a** but they also don't need to be ashamed of their sexuality or gender) but she wasn't really that helpful to the plot and just brought in to expand the universe which was well done through Lex's superhuman hunting files. Also, the post-apocalyptic scene that was just a dream could have been cut but nothing is perfect except movies like Citizen Kane which isn't a lot of fun to watch cause it is too perfect. So to summarize, the theatrical cut is bad, the ultimate cut is Amazing and the other cut is meh. Please give it a second chance because it deserves it and save a good director from losing grace because of something he didn't do."
"I really liked it, don't know what all the hate is about. I'm actually a Marvel fan from when I was 7 or so, but Superman and Batman together in 1 movie? Just great. And personally I like Ben Affleck even better than Christian Bale as Batman. So just watch and enjoy, I know I did!"

"That's right. We have been waiting for these two heroes to finally meet and fight against each other. This movie is so good in both plot and special effects.Henry Cavill and Ben Affleck have performed well in their acting stages. They are the best superhero actors and they have filmed their fighting scenes very well. The movie starts to show the conflict between the lives of the heroes and now they have blamed each other for it. This movie is amazing and sets up a good plot for Dawn Justice."

"Actually...I didn't know what to expect. When you see Wonder Woman, you know it will be off of Wonder Woman and off of a Wonder Woman story, but with Batman V Superman, I was like, \"hmmmm, so who is this about?\" It was pretty obvious that it would feature many characters, but I thought the introduction to Batman was amazing. Ben Affleck nailed the part, not only as Batman but also as Bruce Wayne. He is my Batman. Henry Cavill continued to be super as the Man of Steel. And he is my Super - Man. A dark story? Yes, without a doubt. Could it have had a few more jokes? Sure. But not all movies or stories need to have jokes when certain events are serious. I really hope people can see this review and take another look at the movie, because, I loved it. I really hope the ratings can go up, eventually. And P.S, this movie is the perfect set up to Justice League."

"I'll start by making it clear I have only ever seen the Ultimate Edition. I'm aware of what was cut out for the theatrical release, so I will concede up front that most of the criticisms about pacing, editing, and missing bits of plot at release were merited.With that caveat out of the way, I must reiterate that this was bar-none the boldest superhero movie I have ever seen. To me, it was arguably the best as well, though \"best\" shouldn't be taken to mean \"most enjoyable.\" That honor easily goes to \"Thor: Ragnarok.\" What makes BvS stand out among other films in the genre is that it takes two characters who have been done to death since the 1970s and brings them up to date. I recently tried to watch \"Superman: The Movie\" for the first time in a number of years, and while it was still good and Reeves will always be iconic, I just couldn't take it seriously. I'll put it this way: If the story in BvS was \"stupid\" in your view but Superman turning back time by spinning the earth backward on its axis didn't seem like one of the dumbest things you have ever seen -in any movie from any genre- to the extent that it outright ruins the movie for you, then your opinion about BvS isn't worth much. Nostalgic bias was always going to be a problem for this movie, and the way people reacted to and reviewed \"Man of Steel\" was telling in this regard.That brings me to Zack Snyder's take on Superman. You know, that guy whose status as the first extraterrestrial ever encountered by humanity was a total non-issue in the old movies. Apparently, Snyder has a similar view to my own in that his take on the Man of Steel makes his being an alien a core piece of his identity. He may look like any other (absurdly attractive) person, but he knows what he is, and that makes him perpetually uncertain of where he fits in this world. He is essentially good and really does care about people, but he struggles to truly empathize with the likes of us. To be human is to be frail, and that is not something he can easily relate to. This is the root of his conflict with Batman.Just as Clark struggles to genuinely relate to most people, Snyder's Batman either refuses to or otherwise just can't relate to Superman. He doesn't see him as anything but a threat regardless of Superman's clear good intentions. Remember, a small group of Kryptonians were able to bring humanity to the brink of extinction in less than a day, and Bruce Wayne is nothing if not a realist. He didn't know the guy from Kansas. He only knew the god from another world.While Batman's anger toward and fear of Superman are readily apparent from the start, Superman's inability to imagine things from Bruce Wayne's perspective only becomes truly apparent during their first real interaction. This reminded me of the animated version of the \"world's finest\" storyline, where Superman judges Batman harshly for using fear tactics and threats of violence (also, actual violence) to get the job done. Superman wasn't willing to consider what it would take for a human man to fight criminals and save innocents, or what that life would do to him over time. Just as Batman didn't see the guy from Kansas, Superman didn't see the man who lives his life trapped in one brutal, unthinkably traumatic moment (this was beautifully conveyed during the film's opening moments), and had spent his whole adult life bearing witness to humanity at its absolute worst.The conflict between these two characters is as old as human history. They want the same things, but they can't understand one another. So they fight. And what a fight it was.Watching a fight between, say, Captain America and Iron Man was, to me, more frustrating than anything because each understood the other's perspective perfectly. The fight between Batman and Superman in BvS was genuinely gut-wrenching, as intended, because they would have understood one another if either had tried. The whole sequence hilighted Batman's tactical prowess and ability to control a situation. Maybe the most badass thing about the fight was that it ended exactly where Batman planned. That brings me to the big elephant in the room named \"Martha.\"I can't recall exactly which YouTuber put it this way, but if you thought the \"save Martha\" exchange was about their mothers having the same name, you had your brain turned off. The brain-on people have explained this to death, but it bears repeating. This was the moment when Superman became humanized to Batman. He was about to die, and his only concern was for his adoptive human mother. He still believed that the man about to take his life would do the right thing. Even with the cowl on, there was no mistaking the look on Batman's face. It was the look of shame, guilt, and sudden uncertainty that says \"What am I doing?\" Turns out even the most brutal, angry version of Bruce Wayne is better than Tony Stark at knowing right from wrong. At knowing that he had gone too far.From there, the third act was a series of truly impressive (albeit mostly CGI) fight sequences, beginning with what I regard as the undisputed champion of Batman fights. Nothing in the Nolan movies (and especially nothing in the Burton movies) even came close. Go ahead, try to convince yourself that Batman and Bane taking turns punching one another in the face until Bane's mask broke was a good fight sequence. No, this was a fight straight out of \"Arkham Knight,\" and it was glorious. The battle against Doomsday really was one for the books. From the moment Wonder Woman arrived accompanied by the intense sounds of Tina Guo's electric cello to Superman's tragic, heroic death at the hands of Doomsday, I was glued to the screen. Sure, the mere presence of Doomsday spoiled the end to a degree, but watching the Man of Steel laboring to carry that kryptonite spear towards certain death was no less impactful. A brief word on Jesse Eisenberg's take on Lex Luthor. At least one other reviewer on this site already said it best when they pointed out that this was his origin story. If you consider his scheme objectively, he is actually one of the more formidable incarnations of the character. If we're lucky, we'll eventually get to see a Snyder Cut of \"Justice League\" and find out where this story was actually meant to go. For the record, Joss Whedon and Danny Elfman both should have said \"no\" to taking a dump on someone else's art."
"BATMAN V SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE brings a fantastic surprise to a smash-hit team-up with one of the worlds most beloved DC Comics' icons of all time. The movie delivers spectacular casting, and fantastic acting with different characters having their shine in each scenes.The story follows Clark Kent/Superman who becomes a threat, after the destruction in Metropolis in Man Of Steel.(2013). Batman/Bruce Wayne sees him as a threat and begins his war on Superman.The movie brings spectacular storytelling, it tells the complications of human against alien who are on the same side, and the first meeting of Batman and Superman. The story of Bruce Wayne, with his many years of The Caped Crusader, sends him on a spiral of \"out of control\", sheer anger, and builds tension to wanting to defeat the Man of Steel. Snyder has fantastically gave this storytelling an exciting nod to the comics.Lex Luthor, played by Jesse Einsberg, delivers a very interesting performance, but very differently by him showing is his \"origin\" before he becomes a bald foe to the Man of Steel. He shows that his love of \"god vs man\" terrorises mankind when he ultimately creates Doomsday, and Batman realises Superman's inner heroism.It packs so many great \"out of nowhere\" excitement, including a first-look of the fearful Wonder Woman a.k.a. Diana Prince, played by Gal Gadot, and a fresh-new glimpse of the superhero DC canon: The Justice League.WATCH THIS MOVIE! The critics are out of their mind. It's a fun-packed action adventure which still keeps the movie enjoyable until it's final minutes of the movie. It's a FANTASTIC MOVIE! BEN AFFLECK AS BATMAN... is Incredible!A 10/10 overall!"
"I want to go on record as saying that this is a truly thrilling cinematic experience in so many ways. If pressed, I guess I could acknowledge that there were a couple ... let's say \"clumsy\" moments. And in a film that runs to three hours, that hardly seems like a significant issue, certainly not enough to rate it with fewer than 9 stars.This film has everything. There is dramatic tension right from the start. There is a magnificent story arc that picks up quite seamlessly from 'Man of Steel' and propels the viewer not only into the life of Clark Kent/Superman but also of Bruce Wayne/Batman.The villain is no mere cartoon of a villain; he is truly thoroughly (and apparently irrevocably) diabolical. He is a psychopath, and you wish for his death over and over and over. You want Superman to reduce him to ash with the power of his eyes.I have read a number of viewers' reviews, and it seems that the people who disliked the film / gave it a low rating had rather unfair and unrealistic expectations of it. That is, their own prejudices about how the plot could/should unfold or what the character development could/should be, etc. ruined the film for them. And that is a shame.My thought is: I settle into my seat, wait for the lights to dim, and then I wait to be transported by the film. I accept it, lock, stock, and barrel.As another reviewer remarked, I love how the film begins from the point of view of Bruce Wayne as he is among people on the ground who have fallen victim to the attack of Zod and the other Kryptonians.Why would Bruce Wayne not like Superman? Why would the good people of Earth hurl insults at Superman and burn him in effigy (on the news)? Because the good people of Earth just got catapulted into a new reality in which there are not only extraterrestrial beings (surprise!) but they are also superman! And a group of them are hell-bent on destroying humankind and taking the planet for themselves.It is difficult to see Superman as separate from the whole Kryptonian Krew.It seems that many moviegoers forgot that Bruce Wayne is also human. Sure, he's a hero, but he is flawed.. Just like the rest of us. He is a vigilante, after all.He has let his vigilantism get the better of him. HE is actually the one working outside the boundaries of the law, not Superman. It is the clear head of Alfred that shows us that he has gone into a rather dark place, that he has not seen what is really going on (in Luthor's scheme), and so he chooses to embark on his own scheme scheme to take out the alien invader. He is (allegedly) thinking of the future: if he wipes out the all-powerful alien, then it can't turn on humankind in the future. At least, he convinces himself of that.A philosophical question is raised in the film: should Clark Kent have remained a simple man from Kansas and never have become the Superman? Should he just let people die and let calamities happen? The question is answered for us in the character of Diana Prince/Wonder Woman. She withdrew from mankind (her exact words) and just sat around watching. Watching while people died horrible deaths all around her. So, should Superman have done the same? Do these special beings, these 'metahumans', have some kind of moral imperative to intervene, or should they be allowed to be regular people, too? It seems that humans want it both ways.It seems that humans are saying: \"Don't be a superalien ... except when I and my friends and family are in trouble. Then come save us.\""

"Batman v Superman: Ultimate Edition: If your looking for a quick, cheap thrill then you might not enjoy this film at the time. This movies theatrical version was butchered by WB and in doing so reshaped the story leaving numerous plot holes. So the Ultimate Edition is the full story and the one worth seeing. Watch 'Man of Steel' before seeing this movie. There is much to claw through here, so much so that the audience might easily find themselves exhausted from the overall aggression of the film. However, a lot of the story does work. The action is good, and the emotion feels real most of the time.This film is about Superman trying to become Superman. Trying to help the world, save people, find a place in this world not as an outcast, and yet is looked at has a threat by many. Superman is not from this world, yet He is trying to be human, find a place in this world, be excepted by earths people, and come into his destiny.This film is also about Batman being Batman for 20 years and losing faith in humanity, and fearing Superman, what Superman can do with his powers. Great film, great plot, great visuals. ---Yidioo"
"I didn't see the film in the theaters and just bought the \"Extended Edition \" on Amazon. I never properly saw Man of Steel- i think I rented it and watched it when already exhausted and fell asleep. I saw the mediocre user reviews and horrible reviews from critics of this film.They really have it wrong. This is the very best either Batman or Superman. It has a different take, on things. Much darker then earlier films even darker then the Christopher Nolan Batman films.First of all Christopher Nolan is an Executive Producer. So how bad could it be? I loved Sucker Punch and Zack Snyder was involved with that. So how bad could this be? Hans Zimmer did the music, so how bad could it be?I remember watching the old Superman TV shows and reading the Superman and Batman comics as a little kid and loved them, but i wouldn't call myself a \"fan boy\" of comic universes, like so many younger people today. As an older adult I will admit my favorite TV show of all time was Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but watched it on DVD only after it had finished. I saw the second of the Dark Knight series in the theater, but the other two, I watched on DVD. They were great, but not my favorite films like so many people. i also loved the first couple Superman and Batman films in the older series. Regardless, i was not waiting with baited breath to see Man of Steel or this one.I'm more of a serious film fan, who can watch Stanley Kubrick films over and over and my favorite films in the last twenty years, are Eyes Wide Shut and Intersteller, both of which i've watched multiple times.So, with that said, take it from me, the critics have this film very wrong, just as critics hated 2001: A Space Odyssey when it first came out. This film will have lasting appreciation.Surprised how much I liked Ben Afleck's Batman. it was hard to get into Henry Cavil's scrawnier looking Superman, but it grew on me. Amy Adams was great as Lois Lane, The Gal Gadol Wonder Women was amazing. Lex Luther was terrific, like Nolan's Joker. Jeremy Irons was the best Alfred ever. Holly Hunter and Diane Lane was good too. The movie had bad reviews but made a billion dollars. Hopefully everyone buys the Ultimate Edition and it breaks sales records and the film is re-appreciated. I have no idea what scenes this Ultimate Edition added, but it is pretty perfect. Now I can't wait for Wonder Woman and the Justice League and as soon as I finish writing this am going to watch Man of Steal. I'm into it now!I can only surmise that the bad reviews stem from too much expectations of the rigid fan boy types and the radical changes in tone, we see in this film.Total masterpiece of cinema, but I have a few criticisms. There are a few hollow scenes of typical Idiot cops and authorities getting everything wrong in a cliché type way and it has a few filler scenes of that type and a few moments here and there that felt rushed and cheesy. Maybe not everything restored into the Ultimate Edition should have been. I wish there had been more Kevin Costner scenes."

"The whole entire Batman V Superman movie was great and yes even though it felt slow to the majority of the people who watched it but to me I enjoyed every part and every scene of Batman V Superman and when it got to the fight scenes both batman VS Superman and the Doomsday fight it brought so much drama, intensity, and epic performances. So with that being said I give this movie a good 10/10 because it really did go to my expectations and it brought a powerful performance and a powerful yet epic introduction to the upcoming Justice League."

"When I first wrote a review for this movie a year ago exclaiming my excitement for the film, I had been high off a fresh dose of live-action DC superheroes playing out the beloved comic book stories that I had grown up on. It was all playing out before my eyes and coming to life. After a few months had passed, I began to notice things about the movie that I disliked: little gaps in the story, things that didn't add up, etc. My original rating of a 10 / 10 dropped to an 8 /10. But today it has gone back up to a 10. The extended version of the film not only rectifies the gaps but also silences critics.Many claimed that the movie was too dark or that it just didn't make sense. To those people, I say: \"Pick up a comic book!\" Many of the critics of this particular film were part of the superhero bandwagon that formed when Marvel began its spree of Avengers-related films. In fact, its estimated that over 60% of people who go to see 'superhero' genre films have never picked up a comic book in their life. I would argue that similar numbers could figure to those which view the CW televised DC Universe shows. People complain that DC comics is just too dark but the fact is that these movies are based upon actual comics which are meant to be dark (ex: The Dark Knight Returns, Injustice, etc.). Its like complaining that Game of Thrones (the TV series) sucks because they kill off too many characters. Read the books! Its frustrating to see such a beautiful work of art like Batman V Superman criticized by those ignorant to its universe and its meaning. This movie is in fact a catalyst that opens numerous doorways and leaves true fans in awe of the possibilities for future movies. But regardless of whether or not people choose to educate themselves, this film's DVD/Blu-ray extended version puts the theater release to shame. All of the plot holes and gaps are filled in 30 minutes of extended footage scattered throughout the film. The movie ultimately becomes more complete and people will wish that the movie had shown the full 3 hours of footage in its theatrical debut. As a major DC comics fan, I will of course pick up on things that a comics fan would not, but someone who does not read comics would learn to appreciate this film in its entirety with the extended version. Get your hands on a copy today or find it on Netflix or the internet somewhere!"

"I ignored the bad reviews and watched anyways. This film had a lot to live up to after Civil War was released and I went into this film expecting the worst. It ended up to be the best Superhero film of 2016 to me. One complaint was that this film was more concerned about universe building than telling a great story than Civil War but for me it was the other way around; Civil War felt like a build up to something else and to be honest, I felt that way when I saw the other MCU films. Batman vs Superman however not only had a great story, but it also felt a lot more consistent than Civil War. This film was way more diverse with the cast than the MCU but unlike the MCU, I felt like this film doesn't go overboard with the SJW stuff like the MCU films or The Star Wars Sequel films do. The Visuals were AMAZING, The Score by Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL was AMAZING as well, The Tone is just right as I actually felt for the characters emotionally, The Cinematography kept my eyes glued to the screen, and the script felt really Intelligent and Complex and despite people calling the writing confusing, I was able to piece it together with no problem whatsoever. This film is similar to Empire Strikes back in terms of popularity so over time after the other movies are released, this movie would probably be more popular.This film was way better than I Expected and deserves another chance.

"Its shame to see what critics and marvel fans did to this movie and targeted Zack Snyder for it. I have seen this movie more than 25 times till date. And i enjoy this movie as much as i enjoyed the first time. The fans who have read DC comics, wouldn't be disappointed in this movie. Its dark movie, yes it is. Because the title shows the intense situation at hand. Two superheroes about to rip each other apart for whatever reasons that brought them to this stage. Yes it had to be dark and intense.Only marvel can be stupid enough to show an alien invasion where humans are loosing the battle and the super heroes are cracking jokes while battles as if they are playing ping pong. a person playing Call of Duty game is more serious while playing than the marvel heroes fighting aliens."

"Last week some news came out from somebody online who had claimed to have seen a finished version of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. If you were like me, you've been leery of checking it out because you weren't sure how much might actually be true. Now Zack Snyder has spoken out about the spoiler-filled post, although his response doesn't really clear anything up.In a word, to MTV, he called the post \"hilarious,which might imply that he's saying that it's mostly, if not entirely, untrue. That might be the case, but then again he could have just said it was untrue and he didn't say that. What he did say, however, is that he doesn't like spoilers. While this may seem odd for the director who's most recent trailer appeared to give away the entire movie, Snyder says that's not the case. Even if you've seen the trailer, you can rest easy, as there is much more we have not seen in then finished film. Says Snyder I have the benefit of seeing the movie. It's cool that think it's too much, and I appreciate people not wanting to know, but there's plenty that they don't know. There's a lot of movie that's not in the trailer. In the process of calling the Batman v Superman Reddit review hilarious, Snyder goes on to talk about how he hates it when spoilers come out. The director would much rather that fans see the movie mostly blind. While he understands that some fans may wish to find the answers before hand, he wants his movies to be mysteries going in. If you're, as an audience member, exploring these articles, looking for answers to questions that you have, maybe you're okay with knowing before you go. It's like an individual taste. But like I said, I want people to see the movie without knowing.Spoilers are a topic that mean different things to different people. While most try to avoid them to some degree, the need to solve the mystery is a nearly universal human experience. We have an inclination to want to know the truth, even while also wanting to be surprised. For most of us getting some information is good, but getting all the information is bad, of course, only getting the details that you want can be difficult."
"The theatrical is choppy, poorly edited, hard to follow, with some really good moments mixed in their. The extended is much more fluent and is much easier to follow, it does have a long runtime, which might make it seem a bit dragging on, but if you like long films done right, like Lord of the Rings, you will like this movie as long as you get into the characters and story. Speaking of which, the story starts out perfectly showing Bruce Wayne as a character, and it is very powerful. There are several moments in this movie that are powerful, emotional, and shocking. Characters. Batman is my favorite fictional character of all time, and believe me when I say, Ben Affleck as Batman was perfect, he had the charisma, the anger, and the look of being through some bad stuff Gal Gadot also does perfect as Wonder Woman, but if you want to really see how good she does, go watch the Wonder Woman movie. Henry Call as Superman. I really don't like it when people say Christopher Reeves is better. Don't get me wrong, Reeves does great, but can you imagine him as Superman in this movie? I wouldn't like it. It would be like Adam West playing Batman in The Dark Knight. Henry Cavill does great in this role, I can say everything about him as I said with Ben Affleck. Jesse Eisenberg as Luthor. I thought it was different in a good way. I've heard a criticism for him as being too much like Joker, but is that a bad thing? Joker is my favorite villain, so to see Superman have an enemy that crazy, but still hold the values Luthor needs to be Luthor, I think it is great. The thing I thought this movie was lacking in the first and second acts was humor, at least good humor. If there was more humor, I would've given this movie a ten because it would give a more relaxing feel to the parts that needed it. All in all though, this movie was awesome, it had powerful moments, it was badass, and just plain fun. It had a great story arc and does its job very well."

"*I will be talking about the Ultimate Edition of the film* This was one of the most anticipated CBM of all time. Ever since the arrival and subsequent success of Marvel's The Avengers people have wondered when will DC launch its own cinematic universe, one of the main reasons being the opportunity to finally see titans such as Batman and Superman share the screen together: the ultimate nerd dream. On 2016, the moment finally came for BvS to be released AND.. it performed poorly. Not only did critical reception left a lot to be desired, but fan reactions where surprisingly split after its cinematic debut. People either loved it and called Zack a genius, or hated it and called him a hack. Me, personally, I found myself with middle of the road feelings, for sure, but more leaning towards the negative side with subsequent viewings. The theatrical cut of the film showcased amazing performances, incredible visuals, and action set pieces that seemed like comic book panels come to life, in a good way. However, when it comes to its narrative structure and more technical aspects like editing, the film was seriously flawed. More plot holes than Age of Ultron, questionable character decisions, random editing that lacked cohesion and focus, and forced dramatic moments that lacked any impact because the attempts at character development ranged from limited to nonexistent, especially when it comes to Superman's character. I thought it was a 5/10 movie at best. As such, I was kind of skeptical about the idea of a 30 minute longer version. I say kind of because I know how Zack works. I remember Watchmen being vastly improved with its director's cut, so in a way I was expecting BvS to perform in a similar manner, but I also feared those 30 minutes wold be just there to amplify action and discredit storytelling issues. Oh boy, I'm so glad I was proved wrong. The ultimate cut of the film was infuriating, but not because it was awful, but because it questions the sanity of WB executives and editors and makes you wonder what were they thinking during the editing process. What I got out of the Ultimate Edition was a thought-provoking deconstruction of two very iconic superheroes that gave spotlight to the struggles both of them face when they aren't fighting crime. What I got was an extremely well produced character study on both Batman and Superman in a cynical world, a world dangerously close to our own. We meet Batman as a ruthless, worn out hero that has seen the failure behind his ideals and witnessed some truly horrifying things in his life. Superman, on the other hand, is portrayed as a godlike figure that seeks to do good in the world, but finds himself emotionally conflicted once he realized that every good deed he does leaves behind a trail of destruction (most of it due to Luthor's antics). In my opinion, this is a hugely original approach, one that distances itself from the rest of the competition and delivers a dark, somber, yet relevant superhero movie that understands both characters and gives them real human struggles to deal with. I felt invested in both of them, and hoped that by the end of the film both could find a way to redeem themselves. Their character arcs were very well established during the first two acts of the movie, and by the time we get to the titular climactic battle the emotion behind the jaw-dropping action is intensified. Lex Luthor as a villain was also given more time to develop with this new edition. One of the main criticisms with the original version was the fact that his plan relied too much on conveniences, and the character's mannerisms and mad-scientist attitude was annoying, and that goes without saying his motivations were unclear. Not only do we spend more time understanding his hate for any godlike figure and thus his hatred for Superman, but the added scenes allowed us to witness his entire plan come to fruition. It sells the cold, manipulative, calculating attributes of his comic counterpart. The acting is spot on. Every actor owns his/her role, from Cavill's Superman, to Ben Affleck as Batman, Eisenberg as Luthor, and Gadot as Wonder Woman, whose scenes are brief, but are more than enough to sell the strong and ferocious warrior that she is. Cinematography is stunning, and miles above that of Man of Steel's. And the soundtrack by Zimmer and Junkie XL? Perfect, just perfect. When it comes to flaws, the film still has some of those. The Martha moment, while serving as a pivotal character moment for Batman, felt off in execution, and its understandable that many people got mad at it. If your main complaint about BvS the first time around was its bleak tone and subject matter, this film is still not for you. I understand most were expecting to see the heroes being the most iconic versions of themselves, clashing in an elongated battle and evoking the same feelings The Avengers gave audiences back in 2012. In that sense, the film will remain divisive, but at least I have the comfort of saying that, at the very least, the film is competently made."

"This film was amazing. Ben Affleck was easily the best part of this movie, he brought his a-game as Batman. The chemistry between Affleck & Irons was outstanding. Gal Gadot did a great job as Wonder Woman. The fight between Batman & Superman was awesome. The final fight with Doomsday was outstanding in every way possible. However, there is only one problem with this film and that's Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor. He was sadly missed cast in this role, but then again it's really the fault of Warner Bros. Studios. Overall, this film deliver on almost every level. I highly recommend that you watch the extended version of this film."

"I know I know. I saw it in theaters too, and felt like it could've been so much better. While the Batman element was good, the narrative felt fractured, and the third act was just one long stunt scene. Superman was relegated to a supporting character, and other characters didn't get a chance to shine. And then I chanced on the ultimate cut. Calling it 30 mins of \"extra\" footage is unfair to Zack Snyder because it's exactly these 30 mins that makes the movie a worthy one. What I can say about the theatrical cut is this - It had the blockbuster elements - music, visuals, stunts, CGI. But, it lacked the human elements. The first 20 mins of the movie had it, but not after that. The extended cut in comparison has a flow to the narrative. There are no disjointed scenes, everything flows smoothly, and there's connective tissue. Superman gets to spend some time with his father, and mother. Clark Kent does some investigative journalism. Superman helps the people after the blast. Lois Lane doesn't jump to conclusions, she gets to the bottom of the crime. Lex Luthor apparently had a coherent plan - everything is explained pretty well. Wonder Woman was already good, so there's no change there :) Also, the \"Martha\" scene seems better executed, because it is a few seconds longer, and there's time to breathe it in. So, here's my take on this movie - The theatrical cut was junk. Get the Bluray for ultimate edition, and you shall not be disappointed. I've seen it so many more times now, and it's the definitive cut. It is the movie we deserve. It's a unique take on Batman, and Superman. It's a gritty take on the superhero movie genre, and definitely the best DCEU movie, and the best DC movie since The Dark Knight.P.S. Yes it's dark. We're adults, and we should appreciate mature film making without intentionally silly moments. It attempts to be philosophical, and something deep instead of just trying to make you chuckle."

"This is one of the best superhero movies ever made. Zack Snyder is a magician behind the camera.The reason behind so many complaints is the fact that Warner Bros. marketed this movie as a fight between Batman and Superman. That's not what it is. It's a movie about the origins of the Justice League.The cinematography, the acting and the score are all second to none. This film is phenomenal.P.S: watch the 3 hour extended cut that Snyder intended you to see, not the 2 and a half hour movie that Warner Bros. decided would be better for theaters."

"I don't care what the critics say, this is a very well-done movie. I'll start my review by listing what I like about the movie.1.) Ben Affleck is the best batman to me and it is not close. He pulls off the role of an aging batman extremely well. Also, Zack Snyder's vision of batman is legit. I have always hated batman up until this adaptation of him. Instead of being a conflicted and idealistic batman, this batman is dark, gritty, and 100% a badass. His equipment is decked out with machine guns and he has no aversion to killing people. In fact, he probably kills about 50 criminal by the time this movie is over. The warehouse scene is the coolest batman scene in any movie.2.) The development of a grudge between batman and superman is pulled off flawlessly. It actually makes sense why batman dislikes superman. Then, when they do fight it is about the coolest thing you can expect to see from a superhero film. 3.) I disagree with a lot of people about Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor. In my opinion, he played his role to perfection. 4.) B v S sets up Wonder Woman and Justice League with Gal Gadot's cameo as Wonder Woman and short clips of Aquaman, the Flash, and Cyborg. B v S is one of my favorite superhero films and rewatching it never gets old."

"The theatrical cut of this film is garbage which is why I rated it eight stars instead of nine. The first time I watched this film I didn't like it (not straight out hate but didn't like). Character motivations didn't make any sense, Lex was annoying as s***, editing was sloppy, and it was overly dark and broody for an action superhero movie. A year + a half, five Marvel films, a ton of bad reviews and a Justice League later a thought popped into my head: \"what if I watched BVS again\". This time I didn't have trailers ruining the best moments, I only vaguely remembered the film, and I was conditioned to look at it negatively but something unexpected happened: I actually loved it. Superman was just a normal person that tried to make a difference cause he could that others imposed their own beliefs on. Lex Luthor was a genius that couldn't stand his powerlessness compared to Superman or more accurately a super being. As Alfred said \"The fever, the rage, the feeling of powerlessness that turns good men... cruel\" and you see the same thought process in Batman. Batman, just like Lex Luthor feels powerless in the midst of a god-being and just like Lex he attempts to destroy him so he can get his sense of power back but unlike Lex, Batman learns something. I what is one of the corniest lines of the movie Superman says, \"Martha\" when he knows he can't win against Batman in a late desperate attempt to save his mother. Not only does this name connect with Bruce Wayne but it also shows what really matters to a man of steel: it isn't power, it isn't fame or anything else, it is his Mother and on a broader scale it is people. Lex (who doesn't care about people at all) knows he doesn't have the power so he creates something from his blood and the remains of Zod: A Doomsday for Superman. Not only does this film have depth but it also doesn't always explain it to you which is rare in a blockbuster action superhero flick normally cater to semi-comic book fans and people that want to shove popcorn in their mouths. This film rewards you for really noticing the details while still having massive explosions. One of my favorites is how Lex has all of Batman's branded killed which is why he isn't afraid of the branding at the end or Grandma's Peach Tea as a way of scaring the s*** out of someone. Of course, this film isn't perfect and I do have personal dislikes. The Batman V Superman fight was slow and pretty boring especially after watching such an amazing fight in Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 2 (If you haven't watched the animated Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 1 and 2 you are sorely missing out on something fantastic). Also, the addition of Wonder Woman who pretty much steals a hacker thing, gives it back and then suits up and fights against a giant monster thing. Not to say I don't like Wonder Woman (She is one of my favorite Superheroes of all time who showed not only can woman kick a** but they also don't need to be ashamed of their sexuality or gender) but she wasn't really that helpful to the plot and just brought in to expand the universe which was well done through Lex's superhuman hunting files. Also, the post-apocalyptic scene that was just a dream could have been cut but nothing is perfect except movies like Citizen Kane which isn't a lot of fun to watch cause it is too perfect. So to summarize, the theatrical cut is bad, the ultimate cut is Amazing and the other cut is meh. Please give it a second chance because it deserves it and save a good director from losing grace because of something he didn't do."
"I really liked it, don't know what all the hate is about. I'm actually a Marvel fan from when I was 7 or so, but Superman and Batman together in 1 movie? Just great. And personally I like Ben Affleck even better than Christian Bale as Batman. So just watch and enjoy, I know I did!"

"That's right. We have been waiting for these two heroes to finally meet and fight against each other. This movie is so good in both plot and special effects.Henry Cavill and Ben Affleck have performed well in their acting stages. They are the best superhero actors and they have filmed their fighting scenes very well. The movie starts to show the conflict between the lives of the heroes and now they have blamed each other for it. This movie is amazing and sets up a good plot for Dawn Justice."

"Actually...I didn't know what to expect. When you see Wonder Woman, you know it will be off of Wonder Woman and off of a Wonder Woman story, but with Batman V Superman, I was like, \"hmmmm, so who is this about?\" It was pretty obvious that it would feature many characters, but I thought the introduction to Batman was amazing. Ben Affleck nailed the part, not only as Batman but also as Bruce Wayne. He is my Batman. Henry Cavill continued to be super as the Man of Steel. And he is my Super - Man. A dark story? Yes, without a doubt. Could it have had a few more jokes? Sure. But not all movies or stories need to have jokes when certain events are serious. I really hope people can see this review and take another look at the movie, because, I loved it. I really hope the ratings can go up, eventually. And P.S, this movie is the perfect set up to Justice League."

"I'll start by making it clear I have only ever seen the Ultimate Edition. I'm aware of what was cut out for the theatrical release, so I will concede up front that most of the criticisms about pacing, editing, and missing bits of plot at release were merited.With that caveat out of the way, I must reiterate that this was bar-none the boldest superhero movie I have ever seen. To me, it was arguably the best as well, though \"best\" shouldn't be taken to mean \"most enjoyable.\" That honor easily goes to \"Thor: Ragnarok.\" What makes BvS stand out among other films in the genre is that it takes two characters who have been done to death since the 1970s and brings them up to date. I recently tried to watch \"Superman: The Movie\" for the first time in a number of years, and while it was still good and Reeves will always be iconic, I just couldn't take it seriously. I'll put it this way: If the story in BvS was \"stupid\" in your view but Superman turning back time by spinning the earth backward on its axis didn't seem like one of the dumbest things you have ever seen -in any movie from any genre- to the extent that it outright ruins the movie for you, then your opinion about BvS isn't worth much. Nostalgic bias was always going to be a problem for this movie, and the way people reacted to and reviewed \"Man of Steel\" was telling in this regard.That brings me to Zack Snyder's take on Superman. You know, that guy whose status as the first extraterrestrial ever encountered by humanity was a total non-issue in the old movies. Apparently, Snyder has a similar view to my own in that his take on the Man of Steel makes his being an alien a core piece of his identity. He may look like any other (absurdly attractive) person, but he knows what he is, and that makes him perpetually uncertain of where he fits in this world. He is essentially good and really does care about people, but he struggles to truly empathize with the likes of us. To be human is to be frail, and that is not something he can easily relate to. This is the root of his conflict with Batman.Just as Clark struggles to genuinely relate to most people, Snyder's Batman either refuses to or otherwise just can't relate to Superman. He doesn't see him as anything but a threat regardless of Superman's clear good intentions. Remember, a small group of Kryptonians were able to bring humanity to the brink of extinction in less than a day, and Bruce Wayne is nothing if not a realist. He didn't know the guy from Kansas. He only knew the god from another world.While Batman's anger toward and fear of Superman are readily apparent from the start, Superman's inability to imagine things from Bruce Wayne's perspective only becomes truly apparent during their first real interaction. This reminded me of the animated version of the \"world's finest\" storyline, where Superman judges Batman harshly for using fear tactics and threats of violence (also, actual violence) to get the job done. Superman wasn't willing to consider what it would take for a human man to fight criminals and save innocents, or what that life would do to him over time. Just as Batman didn't see the guy from Kansas, Superman didn't see the man who lives his life trapped in one brutal, unthinkably traumatic moment (this was beautifully conveyed during the film's opening moments), and had spent his whole adult life bearing witness to humanity at its absolute worst.The conflict between these two characters is as old as human history. They want the same things, but they can't understand one another. So they fight. And what a fight it was.Watching a fight between, say, Captain America and Iron Man was, to me, more frustrating than anything because each understood the other's perspective perfectly. The fight between Batman and Superman in BvS was genuinely gut-wrenching, as intended, because they would have understood one another if either had tried. The whole sequence hilighted Batman's tactical prowess and ability to control a situation. Maybe the most badass thing about the fight was that it ended exactly where Batman planned. That brings me to the big elephant in the room named \"Martha.\"I can't recall exactly which YouTuber put it this way, but if you thought the \"save Martha\" exchange was about their mothers having the same name, you had your brain turned off. The brain-on people have explained this to death, but it bears repeating. This was the moment when Superman became humanized to Batman. He was about to die, and his only concern was for his adoptive human mother. He still believed that the man about to take his life would do the right thing. Even with the cowl on, there was no mistaking the look on Batman's face. It was the look of shame, guilt, and sudden uncertainty that says \"What am I doing?\" Turns out even the most brutal, angry version of Bruce Wayne is better than Tony Stark at knowing right from wrong. At knowing that he had gone too far.From there, the third act was a series of truly impressive (albeit mostly CGI) fight sequences, beginning with what I regard as the undisputed champion of Batman fights. Nothing in the Nolan movies (and especially nothing in the Burton movies) even came close. Go ahead, try to convince yourself that Batman and Bane taking turns punching one another in the face until Bane's mask broke was a good fight sequence. No, this was a fight straight out of \"Arkham Knight,\" and it was glorious. The battle against Doomsday really was one for the books. From the moment Wonder Woman arrived accompanied by the intense sounds of Tina Guo's electric cello to Superman's tragic, heroic death at the hands of Doomsday, I was glued to the screen. Sure, the mere presence of Doomsday spoiled the end to a degree, but watching the Man of Steel laboring to carry that kryptonite spear towards certain death was no less impactful. A brief word on Jesse Eisenberg's take on Lex Luthor. At least one other reviewer on this site already said it best when they pointed out that this was his origin story. If you consider his scheme objectively, he is actually one of the more formidable incarnations of the character. If we're lucky, we'll eventually get to see a Snyder Cut of \"Justice League\" and find out where this story was actually meant to go. For the record, Joss Whedon and Danny Elfman both should have said \"no\" to taking a dump on someone else's art."
"BATMAN V SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE brings a fantastic surprise to a smash-hit team-up with one of the worlds most beloved DC Comics' icons of all time. The movie delivers spectacular casting, and fantastic acting with different characters having their shine in each scenes.The story follows Clark Kent/Superman who becomes a threat, after the destruction in Metropolis in Man Of Steel.(2013). Batman/Bruce Wayne sees him as a threat and begins his war on Superman.The movie brings spectacular storytelling, it tells the complications of human against alien who are on the same side, and the first meeting of Batman and Superman. The story of Bruce Wayne, with his many years of The Caped Crusader, sends him on a spiral of \"out of control\", sheer anger, and builds tension to wanting to defeat the Man of Steel. Snyder has fantastically gave this storytelling an exciting nod to the comics.Lex Luthor, played by Jesse Einsberg, delivers a very interesting performance, but very differently by him showing is his \"origin\" before he becomes a bald foe to the Man of Steel. He shows that his love of \"god vs man\" terrorises mankind when he ultimately creates Doomsday, and Batman realises Superman's inner heroism.It packs so many great \"out of nowhere\" excitement, including a first-look of the fearful Wonder Woman a.k.a. Diana Prince, played by Gal Gadot, and a fresh-new glimpse of the superhero DC canon: The Justice League.WATCH THIS MOVIE! The critics are out of their mind. It's a fun-packed action adventure which still keeps the movie enjoyable until it's final minutes of the movie. It's a FANTASTIC MOVIE! BEN AFFLECK AS BATMAN... is Incredible!A 10/10 overall!"
"I want to go on record as saying that this is a truly thrilling cinematic experience in so many ways. If pressed, I guess I could acknowledge that there were a couple ... let's say \"clumsy\" moments. And in a film that runs to three hours, that hardly seems like a significant issue, certainly not enough to rate it with fewer than 9 stars.This film has everything. There is dramatic tension right from the start. There is a magnificent story arc that picks up quite seamlessly from 'Man of Steel' and propels the viewer not only into the life of Clark Kent/Superman but also of Bruce Wayne/Batman.The villain is no mere cartoon of a villain; he is truly thoroughly (and apparently irrevocably) diabolical. He is a psychopath, and you wish for his death over and over and over. You want Superman to reduce him to ash with the power of his eyes.I have read a number of viewers' reviews, and it seems that the people who disliked the film / gave it a low rating had rather unfair and unrealistic expectations of it. That is, their own prejudices about how the plot could/should unfold or what the character development could/should be, etc. ruined the film for them. And that is a shame.My thought is: I settle into my seat, wait for the lights to dim, and then I wait to be transported by the film. I accept it, lock, stock, and barrel.As another reviewer remarked, I love how the film begins from the point of view of Bruce Wayne as he is among people on the ground who have fallen victim to the attack of Zod and the other Kryptonians.Why would Bruce Wayne not like Superman? Why would the good people of Earth hurl insults at Superman and burn him in effigy (on the news)? Because the good people of Earth just got catapulted into a new reality in which there are not only extraterrestrial beings (surprise!) but they are also superman! And a group of them are hell-bent on destroying humankind and taking the planet for themselves.It is difficult to see Superman as separate from the whole Kryptonian Krew.It seems that many moviegoers forgot that Bruce Wayne is also human. Sure, he's a hero, but he is flawed.. Just like the rest of us. He is a vigilante, after all.He has let his vigilantism get the better of him. HE is actually the one working outside the boundaries of the law, not Superman. It is the clear head of Alfred that shows us that he has gone into a rather dark place, that he has not seen what is really going on (in Luthor's scheme), and so he chooses to embark on his own scheme scheme to take out the alien invader. He is (allegedly) thinking of the future: if he wipes out the all-powerful alien, then it can't turn on humankind in the future. At least, he convinces himself of that.A philosophical question is raised in the film: should Clark Kent have remained a simple man from Kansas and never have become the Superman? Should he just let people die and let calamities happen? The question is answered for us in the character of Diana Prince/Wonder Woman. She withdrew from mankind (her exact words) and just sat around watching. Watching while people died horrible deaths all around her. So, should Superman have done the same? Do these special beings, these 'metahumans', have some kind of moral imperative to intervene, or should they be allowed to be regular people, too? It seems that humans want it both ways.It seems that humans are saying: \"Don't be a superalien ... except when I and my friends and family are in trouble. Then come save us.\""

"Batman v Superman: Ultimate Edition: If your looking for a quick, cheap thrill then you might not enjoy this film at the time. This movies theatrical version was butchered by WB and in doing so reshaped the story leaving numerous plot holes. So the Ultimate Edition is the full story and the one worth seeing. Watch 'Man of Steel' before seeing this movie. There is much to claw through here, so much so that the audience might easily find themselves exhausted from the overall aggression of the film. However, a lot of the story does work. The action is good, and the emotion feels real most of the time.This film is about Superman trying to become Superman. Trying to help the world, save people, find a place in this world not as an outcast, and yet is looked at has a threat by many. Superman is not from this world, yet He is trying to be human, find a place in this world, be excepted by earths people, and come into his destiny.This film is also about Batman being Batman for 20 years and losing faith in humanity, and fearing Superman, what Superman can do with his powers. Great film, great plot, great visuals. ---Yidioo"
"I didn't see the film in the theaters and just bought the \"Extended Edition \" on Amazon. I never properly saw Man of Steel- i think I rented it and watched it when already exhausted and fell asleep. I saw the mediocre user reviews and horrible reviews from critics of this film.They really have it wrong. This is the very best either Batman or Superman. It has a different take, on things. Much darker then earlier films even darker then the Christopher Nolan Batman films.First of all Christopher Nolan is an Executive Producer. So how bad could it be? I loved Sucker Punch and Zack Snyder was involved with that. So how bad could this be? Hans Zimmer did the music, so how bad could it be?I remember watching the old Superman TV shows and reading the Superman and Batman comics as a little kid and loved them, but i wouldn't call myself a \"fan boy\" of comic universes, like so many younger people today. As an older adult I will admit my favorite TV show of all time was Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but watched it on DVD only after it had finished. I saw the second of the Dark Knight series in the theater, but the other two, I watched on DVD. They were great, but not my favorite films like so many people. i also loved the first couple Superman and Batman films in the older series. Regardless, i was not waiting with baited breath to see Man of Steel or this one.I'm more of a serious film fan, who can watch Stanley Kubrick films over and over and my favorite films in the last twenty years, are Eyes Wide Shut and Intersteller, both of which i've watched multiple times.So, with that said, take it from me, the critics have this film very wrong, just as critics hated 2001: A Space Odyssey when it first came out. This film will have lasting appreciation.Surprised how much I liked Ben Afleck's Batman. it was hard to get into Henry Cavil's scrawnier looking Superman, but it grew on me. Amy Adams was great as Lois Lane, The Gal Gadol Wonder Women was amazing. Lex Luther was terrific, like Nolan's Joker. Jeremy Irons was the best Alfred ever. Holly Hunter and Diane Lane was good too. The movie had bad reviews but made a billion dollars. Hopefully everyone buys the Ultimate Edition and it breaks sales records and the film is re-appreciated. I have no idea what scenes this Ultimate Edition added, but it is pretty perfect. Now I can't wait for Wonder Woman and the Justice League and as soon as I finish writing this am going to watch Man of Steal. I'm into it now!I can only surmise that the bad reviews stem from too much expectations of the rigid fan boy types and the radical changes in tone, we see in this film.Total masterpiece of cinema, but I have a few criticisms. There are a few hollow scenes of typical Idiot cops and authorities getting everything wrong in a cliché type way and it has a few filler scenes of that type and a few moments here and there that felt rushed and cheesy. Maybe not everything restored into the Ultimate Edition should have been. I wish there had been more Kevin Costner scenes."

So with that being said I give this movie a good 10/10 because it really did go to my expectations and it brought a powerful performance and a powerful yet epic introduction to the upcoming Justice League."

"When I first wrote a review for this movie a year ago exclaiming my excitement for the film, I had been high off a fresh dose of live-action DC superheroes playing out the beloved comic book stories that I had grown up on. It was all playing out before my eyes and coming to life. After a few months had passed, I began to notice things about the movie that I disliked: little gaps in the story, things that didn't add up, etc. My original rating of a 10 / 10 dropped to an 8 /10. But today it has gone back up to a 10. The extended version of the film not only rectifies the gaps but also silences critics.Many claimed that the movie was too dark or that it just didn't make sense. To those people, I say: \"Pick up a comic book!\" Many of the critics of this particular film were part of the superhero bandwagon that formed when Marvel began its spree of Avengers-related films. In fact, its estimated that over 60% of people who go to see 'superhero' genre films have never picked up a comic book in their life. I would argue that similar numbers could figure to those which view the CW televised DC Universe shows. People complain that DC comics is just too dark but the fact is that these movies are based upon actual comics which are meant to be dark (ex: The Dark Knight Returns, Injustice, etc.). Its like complaining that Game of Thrones (the TV series) sucks because they kill off too many characters. Read the books! Its frustrating to see such a beautiful work of art like Batman V Superman criticized by those ignorant to its universe and its meaning. This movie is in fact a catalyst that opens numerous doorways and leaves true fans in awe of the possibilities for future movies. But regardless of whether or not people choose to educate themselves, this film's DVD/Blu-ray extended version puts the theater release to shame. All of the plot holes and gaps are filled in 30 minutes of extended footage scattered throughout the film. The movie ultimately becomes more complete and people will wish that the movie had shown the full 3 hours of footage in its theatrical debut. As a major DC comics fan, I will of course pick up on things that a comics fan would not, but someone who does not read comics would learn to appreciate this film in its entirety with the extended version. Get your hands on a copy today or find it on Netflix or the internet somewhere!"

"I ignored the bad reviews and watched anyways. This film had a lot to live up to after Civil War was released and I went into this film expecting the worst. It ended up to be the best Superhero film of 2016 to me. One complaint was that this film was more concerned about universe building than telling a great story than Civil War but for me it was the other way around; Civil War felt like a build up to something else and to be honest, I felt that way when I saw the other MCU films. Batman vs Superman however not only had a great story, but it also felt a lot more consistent than Civil War. This film was way more diverse with the cast than the MCU but unlike the MCU, I felt like this film doesn't go overboard with the SJW stuff like the MCU films or The Star Wars Sequel films do. The Visuals were AMAZING, The Score by Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL was AMAZING as well, The Tone is just right as I actually felt for the characters emotionally, The Cinematography kept my eyes glued to the screen, and the script felt really Intelligent and Complex and despite people calling the writing confusing, I was able to piece it together with no problem whatsoever. This film is similar to Empire Strikes back in terms of popularity so over time after the other movies are released, this movie would probably be more popular.This film was way better than I Expected and deserves another chance.

"Its shame to see what critics and marvel fans did to this movie and targeted Zack Snyder for it. I have seen this movie more than 25 times till date. And i enjoy this movie as much as i enjoyed the first time. The fans who have read DC comics, wouldn't be disappointed in this movie. Its dark movie, yes it is. Because the title shows the intense situation at hand. Two superheroes about to rip each other apart for whatever reasons that brought them to this stage. Yes it had to be dark and intense.Only marvel can be stupid enough to show an alien invasion where humans are loosing the battle and the super heroes are cracking jokes while battles as if they are playing ping pong. a person playing Call of Duty game is more serious while playing than the marvel heroes fighting aliens."

"Last week some news came out from somebody online who had claimed to have seen a finished version of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. If you were like me, you've been leery of checking it out because you weren't sure how much might actually be true. Now Zack Snyder has spoken out about the spoiler-filled post, although his response doesn't really clear anything up.In a word, to MTV, he called the post \"hilarious,which might imply that he's saying that it's mostly, if not entirely, untrue. That might be the case, but then again he could have just said it was untrue and he didn't say that. What he did say, however, is that he doesn't like spoilers. While this may seem odd for the director who's most recent trailer appeared to give away the entire movie, Snyder says that's not the case. Even if you've seen the trailer, you can rest easy, as there is much more we have not seen in then finished film. Says Snyder I have the benefit of seeing the movie. It's cool that think it's too much, and I appreciate people not wanting to know, but there's plenty that they don't know. There's a lot of movie that's not in the trailer. In the process of calling the Batman v Superman Reddit review hilarious, Snyder goes on to talk about how he hates it when spoilers come out. The director would much rather that fans see the movie mostly blind. While he understands that some fans may wish to find the answers before hand, he wants his movies to be mysteries going in. If you're, as an audience member, exploring these articles, looking for answers to questions that you have, maybe you're okay with knowing before you go. It's like an individual taste. But like I said, I want people to see the movie without knowing.Spoilers are a topic that mean different things to different people. While most try to avoid them to some degree, the need to solve the mystery is a nearly universal human experience. We have an inclination to want to know the truth, even while also wanting to be surprised. For most of us getting some information is good, but getting all the information is bad, of course, only getting the details that you want can be difficult."
"The theatrical is choppy, poorly edited, hard to follow, with some really good moments mixed in their. The extended is much more fluent and is much easier to follow, it does have a long runtime, which might make it seem a bit dragging on, but if you like long films done right, like Lord of the Rings, you will like this movie as long as you get into the characters and story. Speaking of which, the story starts out perfectly showing Bruce Wayne as a character, and it is very powerful. There are several moments in this movie that are powerful, emotional, and shocking. Characters. Batman is my favorite fictional character of all time, and believe me when I say, Ben Affleck as Batman was perfect, he had the charisma, the anger, and the look of being through some bad stuff Gal Gadot also does perfect as Wonder Woman, but if you want to really see how good she does, go watch the Wonder Woman movie. Henry Call as Superman. I really don't like it when people say Christopher Reeves is better. Don't get me wrong, Reeves does great, but can you imagine him as Superman in this movie? I wouldn't like it. It would be like Adam West playing Batman in The Dark Knight. Henry Cavill does great in this role, I can say everything about him as I said with Ben Affleck. Jesse Eisenberg as Luthor. I thought it was different in a good way. I've heard a criticism for him as being too much like Joker, but is that a bad thing? Joker is my favorite villain, so to see Superman have an enemy that crazy, but still hold the values Luthor needs to be Luthor, I think it is great. The thing I thought this movie was lacking in the first and second acts was humor, at least good humor. If there was more humor, I would've given this movie a ten because it would give a more relaxing feel to the parts that needed it. All in all though, this movie was awesome, it had powerful moments, it was badass, and just plain fun. It had a great story arc and does its job very well."

"*I will be talking about the Ultimate Edition of the film* This was one of the most anticipated CBM of all time. Ever since the arrival and subsequent success of Marvel's The Avengers people have wondered when will DC launch its own cinematic universe, one of the main reasons being the opportunity to finally see titans such as Batman and Superman share the screen together: the ultimate nerd dream. On 2016, the moment finally came for BvS to be released AND.. it performed poorly. Not only did critical reception left a lot to be desired, but fan reactions where surprisingly split after its cinematic debut. People either loved it and called Zack a genius, or hated it and called him a hack. Me, personally, I found myself with middle of the road feelings, for sure, but more leaning towards the negative side with subsequent viewings. The theatrical cut of the film showcased amazing performances, incredible visuals, and action set pieces that seemed like comic book panels come to life, in a good way. However, when it comes to its narrative structure and more technical aspects like editing, the film was seriously flawed. More plot holes than Age of Ultron, questionable character decisions, random editing that lacked cohesion and focus, and forced dramatic moments that lacked any impact because the attempts at character development ranged from limited to nonexistent, especially when it comes to Superman's character. I thought it was a 5/10 movie at best. As such, I was kind of skeptical about the idea of a 30 minute longer version. I say kind of because I know how Zack works. I remember Watchmen being vastly improved with its director's cut, so in a way I was expecting BvS to perform in a similar manner, but I also feared those 30 minutes wold be just there to amplify action and discredit storytelling issues. Oh boy, I'm so glad I was proved wrong. The ultimate cut of the film was infuriating, but not because it was awful, but because it questions the sanity of WB executives and editors and makes you wonder what were they thinking during the editing process. What I got out of the Ultimate Edition was a thought-provoking deconstruction of two very iconic superheroes that gave spotlight to the struggles both of them face when they aren't fighting crime. What I got was an extremely well produced character study on both Batman and Superman in a cynical world, a world dangerously close to our own. We meet Batman as a ruthless, worn out hero that has seen the failure behind his ideals and witnessed some truly horrifying things in his life. Superman, on the other hand, is portrayed as a godlike figure that seeks to do good in the world, but finds himself emotionally conflicted once he realized that every good deed he does leaves behind a trail of destruction (most of it due to Luthor's antics). In my opinion, this is a hugely original approach, one that distances itself from the rest of the competition and delivers a dark, somber, yet relevant superhero movie that understands both characters and gives them real human struggles to deal with. I felt invested in both of them, and hoped that by the end of the film both could find a way to redeem themselves. Their character arcs were very well established during the first two acts of the movie, and by the time we get to the titular climactic battle the emotion behind the jaw-dropping action is intensified. Lex Luthor as a villain was also given more time to develop with this new edition. One of the main criticisms with the original version was the fact that his plan relied too much on conveniences, and the character's mannerisms and mad-scientist attitude was annoying, and that goes without saying his motivations were unclear. Not only do we spend more time understanding his hate for any godlike figure and thus his hatred for Superman, but the added scenes allowed us to witness his entire plan come to fruition. It sells the cold, manipulative, calculating attributes of his comic counterpart. The acting is spot on. Every actor owns his/her role, from Cavill's Superman, to Ben Affleck as Batman, Eisenberg as Luthor, and Gadot as Wonder Woman, whose scenes are brief, but are more than enough to sell the strong and ferocious warrior that she is. Cinematography is stunning, and miles above that of Man of Steel's. And the soundtrack by Zimmer and Junkie XL? Perfect, just perfect. When it comes to flaws, the film still has some of those. The Martha moment, while serving as a pivotal character moment for Batman, felt off in execution, and its understandable that many people got mad at it. If your main complaint about BvS the first time around was its bleak tone and subject matter, this film is still not for you. I understand most were expecting to see the heroes being the most iconic versions of themselves, clashing in an elongated battle and evoking the same feelings The Avengers gave audiences back in 2012. In that sense, the film will remain divisive, but at least I have the comfort of saying that, at the very least, the film is competently made."

"This film was amazing. Ben Affleck was easily the best part of this movie, he brought his a-game as Batman. The chemistry between Affleck & Irons was outstanding. Gal Gadot did a great job as Wonder Woman. The fight between Batman & Superman was awesome. The final fight with Doomsday was outstanding in every way possible. However, there is only one problem with this film and that's Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor. He was sadly missed cast in this role, but then again it's really the fault of Warner Bros. Studios. Overall, this film deliver on almost every level. I highly recommend that you watch the extended version of this film."

"I know I know. I saw it in theaters too, and felt like it could've been so much better. While the Batman element was good, the narrative felt fractured, and the third act was just one long stunt scene. Superman was relegated to a supporting character, and other characters didn't get a chance to shine. And then I chanced on the ultimate cut. Calling it 30 mins of \"extra\" footage is unfair to Zack Snyder because it's exactly these 30 mins that makes the movie a worthy one. What I can say about the theatrical cut is this - It had the blockbuster elements - music, visuals, stunts, CGI. But, it lacked the human elements. The first 20 mins of the movie had it, but not after that. The extended cut in comparison has a flow to the narrative. There are no disjointed scenes, everything flows smoothly, and there's connective tissue. Superman gets to spend some time with his father, and mother. Clark Kent does some investigative journalism. Superman helps the people after the blast. Lois Lane doesn't jump to conclusions, she gets to the bottom of the crime. Lex Luthor apparently had a coherent plan - everything is explained pretty well. Wonder Woman was already good, so there's no change there :) Also, the \"Martha\" scene seems better executed, because it is a few seconds longer, and there's time to breathe it in. So, here's my take on this movie - The theatrical cut was junk. Get the Bluray for ultimate edition, and you shall not be disappointed. I've seen it so many more times now, and it's the definitive cut. It is the movie we deserve. It's a unique take on Batman, and Superman. It's a gritty take on the superhero movie genre, and definitely the best DCEU movie, and the best DC movie since The Dark Knight.P.S. Yes it's dark. We're adults, and we should appreciate mature film making without intentionally silly moments. It attempts to be philosophical, and something deep instead of just trying to make you chuckle."

"This is one of the best superhero movies ever made. Zack Snyder is a magician behind the camera.The reason behind so many complaints is the fact that Warner Bros. marketed this movie as a fight between Batman and Superman. That's not what it is. It's a movie about the origins of the Justice League.The cinematography, the acting and the score are all second to none. This film is phenomenal.P.S: watch the 3 hour extended cut that Snyder intended you to see, not the 2 and a half hour movie that Warner Bros. decided would be better for theaters."

"I don't care what the critics say, this is a very well-done movie. I'll start my review by listing what I like about the movie.1.) Ben Affleck is the best batman to me and it is not close. He pulls off the role of an aging batman extremely well. Also, Zack Snyder's vision of batman is legit. I have always hated batman up until this adaptation of him. Instead of being a conflicted and idealistic batman, this batman is dark, gritty, and 100% a badass. His equipment is decked out with machine guns and he has no aversion to killing people. In fact, he probably kills about 50 criminal by the time this movie is over. The warehouse scene is the coolest batman scene in any movie.2.) The development of a grudge between batman and superman is pulled off flawlessly. It actually makes sense why batman dislikes superman. Then, when they do fight it is about the coolest thing you can expect to see from a superhero film. 3.) I disagree with a lot of people about Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor. In my opinion, he played his role to perfection. 4.) B v S sets up Wonder Woman and Justice League with Gal Gadot's cameo as Wonder Woman and short clips of Aquaman, the Flash, and Cyborg. B v S is one of my favorite superhero films and rewatching it never gets old."

"The theatrical cut of this film is garbage which is why I rated it eight stars instead of nine. The first time I watched this film I didn't like it (not straight out hate but didn't like). Character motivations didn't make any sense, Lex was annoying as s***, editing was sloppy, and it was overly dark and broody for an action superhero movie. A year + a half, five Marvel films, a ton of bad reviews and a Justice League later a thought popped into my head: \"what if I watched BVS again\". This time I didn't have trailers ruining the best moments, I only vaguely remembered the film, and I was conditioned to look at it negatively but something unexpected happened: I actually loved it. Superman was just a normal person that tried to make a difference cause he could that others imposed their own beliefs on. Lex Luthor was a genius that couldn't stand his powerlessness compared to Superman or more accurately a super being. As Alfred said \"The fever, the rage, the feeling of powerlessness that turns good men... cruel\" and you see the same thought process in Batman. Batman, just like Lex Luthor feels powerless in the midst of a god-being and just like Lex he attempts to destroy him so he can get his sense of power back but unlike Lex, Batman learns something. I what is one of the corniest lines of the movie Superman says, \"Martha\" when he knows he can't win against Batman in a late desperate attempt to save his mother. Not only does this name connect with Bruce Wayne but it also shows what really matters to a man of steel: it isn't power, it isn't fame or anything else, it is his Mother and on a broader scale it is people. Lex (who doesn't care about people at all) knows he doesn't have the power so he creates something from his blood and the remains of Zod: A Doomsday for Superman. Not only does this film have depth but it also doesn't always explain it to you which is rare in a blockbuster action superhero flick normally cater to semi-comic book fans and people that want to shove popcorn in their mouths. This film rewards you for really noticing the details while still having massive explosions. One of my favorites is how Lex has all of Batman's branded killed which is why he isn't afraid of the branding at the end or Grandma's Peach Tea as a way of scaring the s*** out of someone. Of course, this film isn't perfect and I do have personal dislikes. The Batman V Superman fight was slow and pretty boring especially after watching such an amazing fight in Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 2 (If you haven't watched the animated Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 1 and 2 you are sorely missing out on something fantastic). Also, the addition of Wonder Woman who pretty much steals a hacker thing, gives it back and then suits up and fights against a giant monster thing. Not to say I don't like Wonder Woman (She is one of my favorite Superheroes of all time who showed not only can woman kick a** but they also don't need to be ashamed of their sexuality or gender) but she wasn't really that helpful to the plot and just brought in to expand the universe which was well done through Lex's superhuman hunting files. Also, the post-apocalyptic scene that was just a dream could have been cut but nothing is perfect except movies like Citizen Kane which isn't a lot of fun to watch cause it is too perfect. So to summarize, the theatrical cut is bad, the ultimate cut is Amazing and the other cut is meh. Please give it a second chance because it deserves it and save a good director from losing grace because of something he didn't do."
"I really liked it, don't know what all the hate is about. I'm actually a Marvel fan from when I was 7 or so, but Superman and Batman together in 1 movie? Just great. And personally I like Ben Affleck even better than Christian Bale as Batman. So just watch and enjoy, I know I did!"

"That's right. We have been waiting for these two heroes to finally meet and fight against each other. This movie is so good in both plot and special effects.Henry Cavill and Ben Affleck have performed well in their acting stages. They are the best superhero actors and they have filmed their fighting scenes very well. The movie starts to show the conflict between the lives of the heroes and now they have blamed each other for it. This movie is amazing and sets up a good plot for Dawn Justice."

"Actually...I didn't know what to expect. When you see Wonder Woman, you know it will be off of Wonder Woman and off of a Wonder Woman story, but with Batman V Superman, I was like, \"hmmmm, so who is this about?\" It was pretty obvious that it would feature many characters, but I thought the introduction to Batman was amazing. Ben Affleck nailed the part, not only as Batman but also as Bruce Wayne. He is my Batman. Henry Cavill continued to be super as the Man of Steel. And he is my Super - Man. A dark story? Yes, without a doubt. Could it have had a few more jokes? Sure. But not all movies or stories need to have jokes when certain events are serious. I really hope people can see this review and take another look at the movie, because, I loved it. I really hope the ratings can go up, eventually. And P.S, this movie is the perfect set up to Justice League."

"I'll start by making it clear I have only ever seen the Ultimate Edition. I'm aware of what was cut out for the theatrical release, so I will concede up front that most of the criticisms about pacing, editing, and missing bits of plot at release were merited.With that caveat out of the way, I must reiterate that this was bar-none the boldest superhero movie I have ever seen. To me, it was arguably the best as well, though \"best\" shouldn't be taken to mean \"most enjoyable.\" That honor easily goes to \"Thor: Ragnarok.\" What makes BvS stand out among other films in the genre is that it takes two characters who have been done to death since the 1970s and brings them up to date. I recently tried to watch \"Superman: The Movie\" for the first time in a number of years, and while it was still good and Reeves will always be iconic, I just couldn't take it seriously. I'll put it this way: If the story in BvS was \"stupid\" in your view but Superman turning back time by spinning the earth backward on its axis didn't seem like one of the dumbest things you have ever seen -in any movie from any genre- to the extent that it outright ruins the movie for you, then your opinion about BvS isn't worth much. Nostalgic bias was always going to be a problem for this movie, and the way people reacted to and reviewed \"Man of Steel\" was telling in this regard.That brings me to Zack Snyder's take on Superman. You know, that guy whose status as the first extraterrestrial ever encountered by humanity was a total non-issue in the old movies. Apparently, Snyder has a similar view to my own in that his take on the Man of Steel makes his being an alien a core piece of his identity. He may look like any other (absurdly attractive) person, but he knows what he is, and that makes him perpetually uncertain of where he fits in this world. He is essentially good and really does care about people, but he struggles to truly empathize with the likes of us. To be human is to be frail, and that is not something he can easily relate to. This is the root of his conflict with Batman.Just as Clark struggles to genuinely relate to most people, Snyder's Batman either refuses to or otherwise just can't relate to Superman. He doesn't see him as anything but a threat regardless of Superman's clear good intentions. Remember, a small group of Kryptonians were able to bring humanity to the brink of extinction in less than a day, and Bruce Wayne is nothing if not a realist. He didn't know the guy from Kansas. He only knew the god from another world.While Batman's anger toward and fear of Superman are readily apparent from the start, Superman's inability to imagine things from Bruce Wayne's perspective only becomes truly apparent during their first real interaction. This reminded me of the animated version of the \"world's finest\" storyline, where Superman judges Batman harshly for using fear tactics and threats of violence (also, actual violence) to get the job done. Superman wasn't willing to consider what it would take for a human man to fight criminals and save innocents, or what that life would do to him over time. Just as Batman didn't see the guy from Kansas, Superman didn't see the man who lives his life trapped in one brutal, unthinkably traumatic moment (this was beautifully conveyed during the film's opening moments), and had spent his whole adult life bearing witness to humanity at its absolute worst.The conflict between these two characters is as old as human history. They want the same things, but they can't understand one another. So they fight. And what a fight it was.Watching a fight between, say, Captain America and Iron Man was, to me, more frustrating than anything because each understood the other's perspective perfectly. The fight between Batman and Superman in BvS was genuinely gut-wrenching, as intended, because they would have understood one another if either had tried. The whole sequence hilighted Batman's tactical prowess and ability to control a situation. Maybe the most badass thing about the fight was that it ended exactly where Batman planned. That brings me to the big elephant in the room named \"Martha.\"I can't recall exactly which YouTuber put it this way, but if you thought the \"save Martha\" exchange was about their mothers having the same name, you had your brain turned off. The brain-on people have explained this to death, but it bears repeating. This was the moment when Superman became humanized to Batman. He was about to die, and his only concern was for his adoptive human mother. He still believed that the man about to take his life would do the right thing. Even with the cowl on, there was no mistaking the look on Batman's face. It was the look of shame, guilt, and sudden uncertainty that says \"What am I doing?\" Turns out even the most brutal, angry version of Bruce Wayne is better than Tony Stark at knowing right from wrong. At knowing that he had gone too far.From there, the third act was a series of truly impressive (albeit mostly CGI) fight sequences, beginning with what I regard as the undisputed champion of Batman fights. Nothing in the Nolan movies (and especially nothing in the Burton movies) even came close. Go ahead, try to convince yourself that Batman and Bane taking turns punching one another in the face until Bane's mask broke was a good fight sequence. No, this was a fight straight out of \"Arkham Knight,\" and it was glorious. The battle against Doomsday really was one for the books. From the moment Wonder Woman arrived accompanied by the intense sounds of Tina Guo's electric cello to Superman's tragic, heroic death at the hands of Doomsday, I was glued to the screen. Sure, the mere presence of Doomsday spoiled the end to a degree, but watching the Man of Steel laboring to carry that kryptonite spear towards certain death was no less impactful. A brief word on Jesse Eisenberg's take on Lex Luthor. At least one other reviewer on this site already said it best when they pointed out that this was his origin story. If you consider his scheme objectively, he is actually one of the more formidable incarnations of the character. If we're lucky, we'll eventually get to see a Snyder Cut of \"Justice League\" and find out where this story was actually meant to go. For the record, Joss Whedon and Danny Elfman both should have said \"no\" to taking a dump on someone else's art."
"BATMAN V SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE brings a fantastic surprise to a smash-hit team-up with one of the worlds most beloved DC Comics' icons of all time. The movie delivers spectacular casting, and fantastic acting with different characters having their shine in each scenes.The story follows Clark Kent/Superman who becomes a threat, after the destruction in Metropolis in Man Of Steel.(2013). Batman/Bruce Wayne sees him as a threat and begins his war on Superman.The movie brings spectacular storytelling, it tells the complications of human against alien who are on the same side, and the first meeting of Batman and Superman. The story of Bruce Wayne, with his many years of The Caped Crusader, sends him on a spiral of \"out of control\", sheer anger, and builds tension to wanting to defeat the Man of Steel. Snyder has fantastically gave this storytelling an exciting nod to the comics.Lex Luthor, played by Jesse Einsberg, delivers a very interesting performance, but very differently by him showing is his \"origin\" before he becomes a bald foe to the Man of Steel. He shows that his love of \"god vs man\" terrorises mankind when he ultimately creates Doomsday, and Batman realises Superman's inner heroism.It packs so many great \"out of nowhere\" excitement, including a first-look of the fearful Wonder Woman a.k.a. Diana Prince, played by Gal Gadot, and a fresh-new glimpse of the superhero DC canon: The Justice League.WATCH THIS MOVIE! The critics are out of their mind. It's a fun-packed action adventure which still keeps the movie enjoyable until it's final minutes of the movie. It's a FANTASTIC MOVIE! BEN AFFLECK AS BATMAN... is Incredible!A 10/10 overall!"
"I want to go on record as saying that this is a truly thrilling cinematic experience in so many ways. If pressed, I guess I could acknowledge that there were a couple ... let's say \"clumsy\" moments. And in a film that runs to three hours, that hardly seems like a significant issue, certainly not enough to rate it with fewer than 9 stars.This film has everything. There is dramatic tension right from the start. There is a magnificent story arc that picks up quite seamlessly from 'Man of Steel' and propels the viewer not only into the life of Clark Kent/Superman but also of Bruce Wayne/Batman.The villain is no mere cartoon of a villain; he is truly thoroughly (and apparently irrevocably) diabolical. He is a psychopath, and you wish for his death over and over and over. You want Superman to reduce him to ash with the power of his eyes.I have read a number of viewers' reviews, and it seems that the people who disliked the film / gave it a low rating had rather unfair and unrealistic expectations of it. That is, their own prejudices about how the plot could/should unfold or what the character development could/should be, etc. ruined the film for them. And that is a shame.My thought is: I settle into my seat, wait for the lights to dim, and then I wait to be transported by the film. I accept it, lock, stock, and barrel.As another reviewer remarked, I love how the film begins from the point of view of Bruce Wayne as he is among people on the ground who have fallen victim to the attack of Zod and the other Kryptonians.Why would Bruce Wayne not like Superman? Why would the good people of Earth hurl insults at Superman and burn him in effigy (on the news)? Because the good people of Earth just got catapulted into a new reality in which there are not only extraterrestrial beings (surprise!) but they are also superman! And a group of them are hell-bent on destroying humankind and taking the planet for themselves.It is difficult to see Superman as separate from the whole Kryptonian Krew.It seems that many moviegoers forgot that Bruce Wayne is also human. Sure, he's a hero, but he is flawed.. Just like the rest of us. He is a vigilante, after all.He has let his vigilantism get the better of him. HE is actually the one working outside the boundaries of the law, not Superman. It is the clear head of Alfred that shows us that he has gone into a rather dark place, that he has not seen what is really going on (in Luthor's scheme), and so he chooses to embark on his own scheme scheme to take out the alien invader. He is (allegedly) thinking of the future: if he wipes out the all-powerful alien, then it can't turn on humankind in the future. At least, he convinces himself of that.A philosophical question is raised in the film: should Clark Kent have remained a simple man from Kansas and never have become the Superman? Should he just let people die and let calamities happen? The question is answered for us in the character of Diana Prince/Wonder Woman. She withdrew from mankind (her exact words) and just sat around watching. Watching while people died horrible deaths all around her. So, should Superman have done the same? Do these special beings, these 'metahumans', have some kind of moral imperative to intervene, or should they be allowed to be regular people, too? It seems that humans want it both ways.It seems that humans are saying: \"Don't be a superalien ... except when I and my friends and family are in trouble. Then come save us.\""

"Batman v Superman: Ultimate Edition: If your looking for a quick, cheap thrill then you might not enjoy this film at the time. This movies theatrical version was butchered by WB and in doing so reshaped the story leaving numerous plot holes. So the Ultimate Edition is the full story and the one worth seeing. Watch 'Man of Steel' before seeing this movie. There is much to claw through here, so much so that the audience might easily find themselves exhausted from the overall aggression of the film. However, a lot of the story does work. The action is good, and the emotion feels real most of the time.This film is about Superman trying to become Superman. Trying to help the world, save people, find a place in this world not as an outcast, and yet is looked at has a threat by many. Superman is not from this world, yet He is trying to be human, find a place in this world, be excepted by earths people, and come into his destiny.This film is also about Batman being Batman for 20 years and losing faith in humanity, and fearing Superman, what Superman can do with his powers. Great film, great plot, great visuals. ---Yidioo"
"I didn't see the film in the theaters and just bought the \"Extended Edition \" on Amazon. I never properly saw Man of Steel- i think I rented it and watched it when already exhausted and fell asleep. I saw the mediocre user reviews and horrible reviews from critics of this film.They really have it wrong. This is the very best either Batman or Superman. It has a different take, on things. Much darker then earlier films even darker then the Christopher Nolan Batman films.First of all Christopher Nolan is an Executive Producer. So how bad could it be? I loved Sucker Punch and Zack Snyder was involved with that. So how bad could this be? Hans Zimmer did the music, so how bad could it be?I remember watching the old Superman TV shows and reading the Superman and Batman comics as a little kid and loved them, but i wouldn't call myself a \"fan boy\" of comic universes, like so many younger people today. As an older adult I will admit my favorite TV show of all time was Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but watched it on DVD only after it had finished. I saw the second of the Dark Knight series in the theater, but the other two, I watched on DVD. They were great, but not my favorite films like so many people. i also loved the first couple Superman and Batman films in the older series. Regardless, i was not waiting with baited breath to see Man of Steel or this one.I'm more of a serious film fan, who can watch Stanley Kubrick films over and over and my favorite films in the last twenty years, are Eyes Wide Shut and Intersteller, both of which i've watched multiple times.So, with that said, take it from me, the critics have this film very wrong, just as critics hated 2001: A Space Odyssey when it first came out. This film will have lasting appreciation.Surprised how much I liked Ben Afleck's Batman. it was hard to get into Henry Cavil's scrawnier looking Superman, but it grew on me. Amy Adams was great as Lois Lane, The Gal Gadol Wonder Women was amazing. Lex Luther was terrific, like Nolan's Joker. Jeremy Irons was the best Alfred ever. Holly Hunter and Diane Lane was good too. The movie had bad reviews but made a billion dollars. Hopefully everyone buys the Ultimate Edition and it breaks sales records and the film is re-appreciated. I have no idea what scenes this Ultimate Edition added, but it is pretty perfect. Now I can't wait for Wonder Woman and the Justice League and as soon as I finish writing this am going to watch Man of Steal. I'm into it now!I can only surmise that the bad reviews stem from too much expectations of the rigid fan boy types and the radical changes in tone, we see in this film.Total masterpiece of cinema, but I have a few criticisms. There are a few hollow scenes of typical Idiot cops and authorities getting everything wrong in a cliché type way and it has a few filler scenes of that type and a few moments here and there that felt rushed and cheesy. Maybe not everything restored into the Ultimate Edition should have been. I wish there had been more Kevin Costner scenes."

"The whole entire Batman V Superman movie was great and yes even though it felt slow to the majority of the people who watched it but to me I enjoyed every part and every scene of Batman V Superman and when it got to the fight scenes both batman VS Superman and the Doomsday fight it brought so much drama, intensity, and epic performances. So with that being said I give this movie a good 10/10 because it really did go to my expectations and it brought a powerful performance and a powerful yet epic introduction to the upcoming Justice League."

"When I first wrote a review for this movie a year ago exclaiming my excitement for the film, I had been high off a fresh dose of live-action DC superheroes playing out the beloved comic book stories that I had grown up on. It was all playing out before my eyes and coming to life. After a few months had passed, I began to notice things about the movie that I disliked: little gaps in the story, things that didn't add up, etc. My original rating of a 10 / 10 dropped to an 8 /10. But today it has gone back up to a 10. The extended version of the film not only rectifies the gaps but also silences critics.Many claimed that the movie was too dark or that it just didn't make sense. To those people, I say: \"Pick up a comic book!\" Many of the critics of this particular film were part of the superhero bandwagon that formed when Marvel began its spree of Avengers-related films. In fact, its estimated that over 60% of people who go to see 'superhero' genre films have never picked up a comic book in their life. I would argue that similar numbers could figure to those which view the CW televised DC Universe shows. People complain that DC comics is just too dark but the fact is that these movies are based upon actual comics which are meant to be dark (ex: The Dark Knight Returns, Injustice, etc.). Its like complaining that Game of Thrones (the TV series) sucks because they kill off too many characters. Read the books! Its frustrating to see such a beautiful work of art like Batman V Superman criticized by those ignorant to its universe and its meaning. This movie is in fact a catalyst that opens numerous doorways and leaves true fans in awe of the possibilities for future movies. But regardless of whether or not people choose to educate themselves, this film's DVD/Blu-ray extended version puts the theater release to shame. All of the plot holes and gaps are filled in 30 minutes of extended footage scattered throughout the film. The movie ultimately becomes more complete and people will wish that the movie had shown the full 3 hours of footage in its theatrical debut. As a major DC comics fan, I will of course pick up on things that a comics fan would not, but someone who does not read comics would learn to appreciate this film in its entirety with the extended version. Get your hands on a copy today or find it on Netflix or the internet somewhere!"

"I ignored the bad reviews and watched anyways. This film had a lot to live up to after Civil War was released and I went into this film expecting the worst. It ended up to be the best Superhero film of 2016 to me. One complaint was that this film was more concerned about universe building than telling a great story than Civil War but for me it was the other way around; Civil War felt like a build up to something else and to be honest, I felt that way when I saw the other MCU films. Batman vs Superman however not only had a great story, but it also felt a lot more consistent than Civil War. This film was way more diverse with the cast than the MCU but unlike the MCU, I felt like this film doesn't go overboard with the SJW stuff like the MCU films or The Star Wars Sequel films do. The Visuals were AMAZING, The Score by Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL was AMAZING as well, The Tone is just right as I actually felt for the characters emotionally, The Cinematography kept my eyes glued to the screen, and the script felt really Intelligent and Complex and despite people calling the writing confusing, I was able to piece it together with no problem whatsoever. This film is similar to Empire Strikes back in terms of popularity so over time after the other movies are released, this movie would probably be more popular.This film was way better than I Expected and deserves another chance.

"Its shame to see what critics and marvel fans did to this movie and targeted Zack Snyder for it. I have seen this movie more than 25 times till date. And i enjoy this movie as much as i enjoyed the first time. The fans who have read DC comics, wouldn't be disappointed in this movie. Its dark movie, yes it is. Because the title shows the intense situation at hand. Two superheroes about to rip each other apart for whatever reasons that brought them to this stage. Yes it had to be dark and intense.Only marvel can be stupid enough to show an alien invasion where humans are loosing the battle and the super heroes are cracking jokes while battles as if they are playing ping pong. a person playing Call of Duty game is more serious while playing than the marvel heroes fighting aliens."

"Last week some news came out from somebody online who had claimed to have seen a finished version of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. If you were like me, you've been leery of checking it out because you weren't sure how much might actually be true. Now Zack Snyder has spoken out about the spoiler-filled post, although his response doesn't really clear anything up.In a word, to MTV, he called the post \"hilarious,which might imply that he's saying that it's mostly, if not entirely, untrue. That might be the case, but then again he could have just said it was untrue and he didn't say that. What he did say, however, is that he doesn't like spoilers. While this may seem odd for the director who's most recent trailer appeared to give away the entire movie, Snyder says that's not the case. Even if you've seen the trailer, you can rest easy, as there is much more we have not seen in then finished film. Says Snyder I have the benefit of seeing the movie. It's cool that think it's too much, and I appreciate people not wanting to know, but there's plenty that they don't know. There's a lot of movie that's not in the trailer. In the process of calling the Batman v Superman Reddit review hilarious, Snyder goes on to talk about how he hates it when spoilers come out. The director would much rather that fans see the movie mostly blind. While he understands that some fans may wish to find the answers before hand, he wants his movies to be mysteries going in. If you're, as an audience member, exploring these articles, looking for answers to questions that you have, maybe you're okay with knowing before you go. It's like an individual taste. But like I said, I want people to see the movie without knowing.Spoilers are a topic that mean different things to different people. While most try to avoid them to some degree, the need to solve the mystery is a nearly universal human experience. We have an inclination to want to know the truth, even while also wanting to be surprised. For most of us getting some information is good, but getting all the information is bad, of course, only getting the details that you want can be difficult."
"The theatrical is choppy, poorly edited, hard to follow, with some really good moments mixed in their. The extended is much more fluent and is much easier to follow, it does have a long runtime, which might make it seem a bit dragging on, but if you like long films done right, like Lord of the Rings, you will like this movie as long as you get into the characters and story. Speaking of which, the story starts out perfectly showing Bruce Wayne as a character, and it is very powerful. There are several moments in this movie that are powerful, emotional, and shocking. Characters. Batman is my favorite fictional character of all time, and believe me when I say, Ben Affleck as Batman was perfect, he had the charisma, the anger, and the look of being through some bad stuff Gal Gadot also does perfect as Wonder Woman, but if you want to really see how good she does, go watch the Wonder Woman movie. Henry Call as Superman. I really don't like it when people say Christopher Reeves is better. Don't get me wrong, Reeves does great, but can you imagine him as Superman in this movie? I wouldn't like it. It would be like Adam West playing Batman in The Dark Knight. Henry Cavill does great in this role, I can say everything about him as I said with Ben Affleck. Jesse Eisenberg as Luthor. I thought it was different in a good way. I've heard a criticism for him as being too much like Joker, but is that a bad thing? Joker is my favorite villain, so to see Superman have an enemy that crazy, but still hold the values Luthor needs to be Luthor, I think it is great. The thing I thought this movie was lacking in the first and second acts was humor, at least good humor. If there was more humor, I would've given this movie a ten because it would give a more relaxing feel to the parts that needed it. All in all though, this movie was awesome, it had powerful moments, it was badass, and just plain fun. It had a great story arc and does its job very well."

"*I will be talking about the Ultimate Edition of the film* This was one of the most anticipated CBM of all time. Ever since the arrival and subsequent success of Marvel's The Avengers people have wondered when will DC launch its own cinematic universe, one of the main reasons being the opportunity to finally see titans such as Batman and Superman share the screen together: the ultimate nerd dream. On 2016, the moment finally came for BvS to be released AND.. it performed poorly. Not only did critical reception left a lot to be desired, but fan reactions where surprisingly split after its cinematic debut. People either loved it and called Zack a genius, or hated it and called him a hack. Me, personally, I found myself with middle of the road feelings, for sure, but more leaning towards the negative side with subsequent viewings. The theatrical cut of the film showcased amazing performances, incredible visuals, and action set pieces that seemed like comic book panels come to life, in a good way. However, when it comes to its narrative structure and more technical aspects like editing, the film was seriously flawed. More plot holes than Age of Ultron, questionable character decisions, random editing that lacked cohesion and focus, and forced dramatic moments that lacked any impact because the attempts at character development ranged from limited to nonexistent, especially when it comes to Superman's character. I thought it was a 5/10 movie at best. As such, I was kind of skeptical about the idea of a 30 minute longer version. I say kind of because I know how Zack works. I remember Watchmen being vastly improved with its director's cut, so in a way I was expecting BvS to perform in a similar manner, but I also feared those 30 minutes wold be just there to amplify action and discredit storytelling issues. Oh boy, I'm so glad I was proved wrong. The ultimate cut of the film was infuriating, but not because it was awful, but because it questions the sanity of WB executives and editors and makes you wonder what were they thinking during the editing process. What I got out of the Ultimate Edition was a thought-provoking deconstruction of two very iconic superheroes that gave spotlight to the struggles both of them face when they aren't fighting crime. What I got was an extremely well produced character study on both Batman and Superman in a cynical world, a world dangerously close to our own. We meet Batman as a ruthless, worn out hero that has seen the failure behind his ideals and witnessed some truly horrifying things in his life. Superman, on the other hand, is portrayed as a godlike figure that seeks to do good in the world, but finds himself emotionally conflicted once he realized that every good deed he does leaves behind a trail of destruction (most of it due to Luthor's antics). In my opinion, this is a hugely original approach, one that distances itself from the rest of the competition and delivers a dark, somber, yet relevant superhero movie that understands both characters and gives them real human struggles to deal with. I felt invested in both of them, and hoped that by the end of the film both could find a way to redeem themselves. Their character arcs were very well established during the first two acts of the movie, and by the time we get to the titular climactic battle the emotion behind the jaw-dropping action is intensified. Lex Luthor as a villain was also given more time to develop with this new edition. One of the main criticisms with the original version was the fact that his plan relied too much on conveniences, and the character's mannerisms and mad-scientist attitude was annoying, and that goes without saying his motivations were unclear. Not only do we spend more time understanding his hate for any godlike figure and thus his hatred for Superman, but the added scenes allowed us to witness his entire plan come to fruition. It sells the cold, manipulative, calculating attributes of his comic counterpart. The acting is spot on. Every actor owns his/her role, from Cavill's Superman, to Ben Affleck as Batman, Eisenberg as Luthor, and Gadot as Wonder Woman, whose scenes are brief, but are more than enough to sell the strong and ferocious warrior that she is. Cinematography is stunning, and miles above that of Man of Steel's. And the soundtrack by Zimmer and Junkie XL? Perfect, just perfect. When it comes to flaws, the film still has some of those. The Martha moment, while serving as a pivotal character moment for Batman, felt off in execution, and its understandable that many people got mad at it. If your main complaint about BvS the first time around was its bleak tone and subject matter, this film is still not for you. I understand most were expecting to see the heroes being the most iconic versions of themselves, clashing in an elongated battle and evoking the same feelings The Avengers gave audiences back in 2012. In that sense, the film will remain divisive, but at least I have the comfort of saying that, at the very least, the film is competently made."

"This film was amazing. Ben Affleck was easily the best part of this movie, he brought his a-game as Batman. The chemistry between Affleck & Irons was outstanding. Gal Gadot did a great job as Wonder Woman. The fight between Batman & Superman was awesome. The final fight with Doomsday was outstanding in every way possible. However, there is only one problem with this film and that's Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor. He was sadly missed cast in this role, but then again it's really the fault of Warner Bros. Studios. Overall, this film deliver on almost every level. I highly recommend that you watch the extended version of this film."

"I know I know. I saw it in theaters too, and felt like it could've been so much better. While the Batman element was good, the narrative felt fractured, and the third act was just one long stunt scene. Superman was relegated to a supporting character, and other characters didn't get a chance to shine. And then I chanced on the ultimate cut. Calling it 30 mins of \"extra\" footage is unfair to Zack Snyder because it's exactly these 30 mins that makes the movie a worthy one. What I can say about the theatrical cut is this - It had the blockbuster elements - music, visuals, stunts, CGI. But, it lacked the human elements. The first 20 mins of the movie had it, but not after that. The extended cut in comparison has a flow to the narrative. There are no disjointed scenes, everything flows smoothly, and there's connective tissue. Superman gets to spend some time with his father, and mother. Clark Kent does some investigative journalism. Superman helps the people after the blast. Lois Lane doesn't jump to conclusions, she gets to the bottom of the crime. Lex Luthor apparently had a coherent plan - everything is explained pretty well. Wonder Woman was already good, so there's no change there :) Also, the \"Martha\" scene seems better executed, because it is a few seconds longer, and there's time to breathe it in. So, here's my take on this movie - The theatrical cut was junk. Get the Bluray for ultimate edition, and you shall not be disappointed. I've seen it so many more times now, and it's the definitive cut. It is the movie we deserve. It's a unique take on Batman, and Superman. It's a gritty take on the superhero movie genre, and definitely the best DCEU movie, and the best DC movie since The Dark Knight.P.S. Yes it's dark. We're adults, and we should appreciate mature film making without intentionally silly moments. It attempts to be philosophical, and something deep instead of just trying to make you chuckle."

"This is one of the best superhero movies ever made. Zack Snyder is a magician behind the camera.The reason behind so many complaints is the fact that Warner Bros. marketed this movie as a fight between Batman and Superman. That's not what it is. It's a movie about the origins of the Justice League.The cinematography, the acting and the score are all second to none. This film is phenomenal.P.S: watch the 3 hour extended cut that Snyder intended you to see, not the 2 and a half hour movie that Warner Bros. decided would be better for theaters."

"I don't care what the critics say, this is a very well-done movie. I'll start my review by listing what I like about the movie.1.) Ben Affleck is the best batman to me and it is not close. He pulls off the role of an aging batman extremely well. Also, Zack Snyder's vision of batman is legit. I have always hated batman up until this adaptation of him. Instead of being a conflicted and idealistic batman, this batman is dark, gritty, and 100% a badass. His equipment is decked out with machine guns and he has no aversion to killing people. In fact, he probably kills about 50 criminal by the time this movie is over. The warehouse scene is the coolest batman scene in any movie.2.) The development of a grudge between batman and superman is pulled off flawlessly. It actually makes sense why batman dislikes superman. Then, when they do fight it is about the coolest thing you can expect to see from a superhero film. 3.) I disagree with a lot of people about Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor. In my opinion, he played his role to perfection. 4.) B v S sets up Wonder Woman and Justice League with Gal Gadot's cameo as Wonder Woman and short clips of Aquaman, the Flash, and Cyborg. B v S is one of my favorite superhero films and rewatching it never gets old."

"The theatrical cut of this film is garbage which is why I rated it eight stars instead of nine. The first time I watched this film I didn't like it (not straight out hate but didn't like). Character motivations didn't make any sense, Lex was annoying as s***, editing was sloppy, and it was overly dark and broody for an action superhero movie. A year + a half, five Marvel films, a ton of bad reviews and a Justice League later a thought popped into my head: \"what if I watched BVS again\". This time I didn't have trailers ruining the best moments, I only vaguely remembered the film, and I was conditioned to look at it negatively but something unexpected happened: I actually loved it. Superman was just a normal person that tried to make a difference cause he could that others imposed their own beliefs on. Lex Luthor was a genius that couldn't stand his powerlessness compared to Superman or more accurately a super being. As Alfred said \"The fever, the rage, the feeling of powerlessness that turns good men... cruel\" and you see the same thought process in Batman. Batman, just like Lex Luthor feels powerless in the midst of a god-being and just like Lex he attempts to destroy him so he can get his sense of power back but unlike Lex, Batman learns something. I what is one of the corniest lines of the movie Superman says, \"Martha\" when he knows he can't win against Batman in a late desperate attempt to save his mother. Not only does this name connect with Bruce Wayne but it also shows what really matters to a man of steel: it isn't power, it isn't fame or anything else, it is his Mother and on a broader scale it is people. Lex (who doesn't care about people at all) knows he doesn't have the power so he creates something from his blood and the remains of Zod: A Doomsday for Superman. Not only does this film have depth but it also doesn't always explain it to you which is rare in a blockbuster action superhero flick normally cater to semi-comic book fans and people that want to shove popcorn in their mouths. This film rewards you for really noticing the details while still having massive explosions. One of my favorites is how Lex has all of Batman's branded killed which is why he isn't afraid of the branding at the end or Grandma's Peach Tea as a way of scaring the s*** out of someone. Of course, this film isn't perfect and I do have personal dislikes. The Batman V Superman fight was slow and pretty boring especially after watching such an amazing fight in Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 2 (If you haven't watched the animated Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 1 and 2 you are sorely missing out on something fantastic). Also, the addition of Wonder Woman who pretty much steals a hacker thing, gives it back and then suits up and fights against a giant monster thing. Not to say I don't like Wonder Woman (She is one of my favorite Superheroes of all time who showed not only can woman kick a** but they also don't need to be ashamed of their sexuality or gender) but she wasn't really that helpful to the plot and just brought in to expand the universe which was well done through Lex's superhuman hunting files. Also, the post-apocalyptic scene that was just a dream could have been cut but nothing is perfect except movies like Citizen Kane which isn't a lot of fun to watch cause it is too perfect. So to summarize, the theatrical cut is bad, the ultimate cut is Amazing and the other cut is meh. Please give it a second chance because it deserves it and save a good director from losing grace because of something he didn't do."
"I really liked it, don't know what all the hate is about. I'm actually a Marvel fan from when I was 7 or so, but Superman and Batman together in 1 movie? Just great. And personally I like Ben Affleck even better than Christian Bale as Batman. So just watch and enjoy, I know I did!"

"That's right. We have been waiting for these two heroes to finally meet and fight against each other. This movie is so good in both plot and special effects.Henry Cavill and Ben Affleck have performed well in their acting stages. They are the best superhero actors and they have filmed their fighting scenes very well. The movie starts to show the conflict between the lives of the heroes and now they have blamed each other for it. This movie is amazing and sets up a good plot for Dawn Justice."

"Actually...I didn't know what to expect. When you see Wonder Woman, you know it will be off of Wonder Woman and off of a Wonder Woman story, but with Batman V Superman, I was like, \"hmmmm, so who is this about?\" It was pretty obvious that it would feature many characters, but I thought the introduction to Batman was amazing. Ben Affleck nailed the part, not only as Batman but also as Bruce Wayne. He is my Batman. Henry Cavill continued to be super as the Man of Steel. And he is my Super - Man. A dark story? Yes, without a doubt. Could it have had a few more jokes? Sure. But not all movies or stories need to have jokes when certain events are serious. I really hope people can see this review and take another look at the movie, because, I loved it. I really hope the ratings can go up, eventually. And P.S, this movie is the perfect set up to Justice League."

"I'll start by making it clear I have only ever seen the Ultimate Edition. I'm aware of what was cut out for the theatrical release, so I will concede up front that most of the criticisms about pacing, editing, and missing bits of plot at release were merited.With that caveat out of the way, I must reiterate that this was bar-none the boldest superhero movie I have ever seen. To me, it was arguably the best as well, though \"best\" shouldn't be taken to mean \"most enjoyable.\" That honor easily goes to \"Thor: Ragnarok.\" What makes BvS stand out among other films in the genre is that it takes two characters who have been done to death since the 1970s and brings them up to date. I recently tried to watch \"Superman: The Movie\" for the first time in a number of years, and while it was still good and Reeves will always be iconic, I just couldn't take it seriously. I'll put it this way: If the story in BvS was \"stupid\" in your view but Superman turning back time by spinning the earth backward on its axis didn't seem like one of the dumbest things you have ever seen -in any movie from any genre- to the extent that it outright ruins the movie for you, then your opinion about BvS isn't worth much. Nostalgic bias was always going to be a problem for this movie, and the way people reacted to and reviewed \"Man of Steel\" was telling in this regard.That brings me to Zack Snyder's take on Superman. You know, that guy whose status as the first extraterrestrial ever encountered by humanity was a total non-issue in the old movies. Apparently, Snyder has a similar view to my own in that his take on the Man of Steel makes his being an alien a core piece of his identity. He may look like any other (absurdly attractive) person, but he knows what he is, and that makes him perpetually uncertain of where he fits in this world. He is essentially good and really does care about people, but he struggles to truly empathize with the likes of us. To be human is to be frail, and that is not something he can easily relate to. This is the root of his conflict with Batman.Just as Clark struggles to genuinely relate to most people, Snyder's Batman either refuses to or otherwise just can't relate to Superman. He doesn't see him as anything but a threat regardless of Superman's clear good intentions. Remember, a small group of Kryptonians were able to bring humanity to the brink of extinction in less than a day, and Bruce Wayne is nothing if not a realist. He didn't know the guy from Kansas. He only knew the god from another world.While Batman's anger toward and fear of Superman are readily apparent from the start, Superman's inability to imagine things from Bruce Wayne's perspective only becomes truly apparent during their first real interaction. This reminded me of the animated version of the \"world's finest\" storyline, where Superman judges Batman harshly for using fear tactics and threats of violence (also, actual violence) to get the job done. Superman wasn't willing to consider what it would take for a human man to fight criminals and save innocents, or what that life would do to him over time. Just as Batman didn't see the guy from Kansas, Superman didn't see the man who lives his life trapped in one brutal, unthinkably traumatic moment (this was beautifully conveyed during the film's opening moments), and had spent his whole adult life bearing witness to humanity at its absolute worst.The conflict between these two characters is as old as human history. They want the same things, but they can't understand one another. So they fight. And what a fight it was.Watching a fight between, say, Captain America and Iron Man was, to me, more frustrating than anything because each understood the other's perspective perfectly. The fight between Batman and Superman in BvS was genuinely gut-wrenching, as intended, because they would have understood one another if either had tried. The whole sequence hilighted Batman's tactical prowess and ability to control a situation. Maybe the most badass thing about the fight was that it ended exactly where Batman planned. That brings me to the big elephant in the room named \"Martha.\"I can't recall exactly which YouTuber put it this way, but if you thought the \"save Martha\" exchange was about their mothers having the same name, you had your brain turned off. The brain-on people have explained this to death, but it bears repeating. This was the moment when Superman became humanized to Batman. He was about to die, and his only concern was for his adoptive human mother. He still believed that the man about to take his life would do the right thing. Even with the cowl on, there was no mistaking the look on Batman's face. It was the look of shame, guilt, and sudden uncertainty that says \"What am I doing?\" Turns out even the most brutal, angry version of Bruce Wayne is better than Tony Stark at knowing right from wrong. At knowing that he had gone too far.From there, the third act was a series of truly impressive (albeit mostly CGI) fight sequences, beginning with what I regard as the undisputed champion of Batman fights. Nothing in the Nolan movies (and especially nothing in the Burton movies) even came close. Go ahead, try to convince yourself that Batman and Bane taking turns punching one another in the face until Bane's mask broke was a good fight sequence. No, this was a fight straight out of \"Arkham Knight,\" and it was glorious. The battle against Doomsday really was one for the books. From the moment Wonder Woman arrived accompanied by the intense sounds of Tina Guo's electric cello to Superman's tragic, heroic death at the hands of Doomsday, I was glued to the screen. Sure, the mere presence of Doomsday spoiled the end to a degree, but watching the Man of Steel laboring to carry that kryptonite spear towards certain death was no less impactful. A brief word on Jesse Eisenberg's take on Lex Luthor. At least one other reviewer on this site already said it best when they pointed out that this was his origin story. If you consider his scheme objectively, he is actually one of the more formidable incarnations of the character. If we're lucky, we'll eventually get to see a Snyder Cut of \"Justice League\" and find out where this story was actually meant to go. For the record, Joss Whedon and Danny Elfman both should have said \"no\" to taking a dump on someone else's art."
"BATMAN V SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE brings a fantastic surprise to a smash-hit team-up with one of the worlds most beloved DC Comics' icons of all time. The movie delivers spectacular casting, and fantastic acting with different characters having their shine in each scenes.The story follows Clark Kent/Superman who becomes a threat, after the destruction in Metropolis in Man Of Steel.(2013). Batman/Bruce Wayne sees him as a threat and begins his war on Superman.The movie brings spectacular storytelling, it tells the complications of human against alien who are on the same side, and the first meeting of Batman and Superman. The story of Bruce Wayne, with his many years of The Caped Crusader, sends him on a spiral of \"out of control\", sheer anger, and builds tension to wanting to defeat the Man of Steel. Snyder has fantastically gave this storytelling an exciting nod to the comics.Lex Luthor, played by Jesse Einsberg, delivers a very interesting performance, but very differently by him showing is his \"origin\" before he becomes a bald foe to the Man of Steel. He shows that his love of \"god vs man\" terrorises mankind when he ultimately creates Doomsday, and Batman realises Superman's inner heroism.It packs so many great \"out of nowhere\" excitement, including a first-look of the fearful Wonder Woman a.k.a. Diana Prince, played by Gal Gadot, and a fresh-new glimpse of the superhero DC canon: The Justice League.WATCH THIS MOVIE! The critics are out of their mind. It's a fun-packed action adventure which still keeps the movie enjoyable until it's final minutes of the movie. It's a FANTASTIC MOVIE! BEN AFFLECK AS BATMAN... is Incredible!A 10/10 overall!"
"I want to go on record as saying that this is a truly thrilling cinematic experience in so many ways. If pressed, I guess I could acknowledge that there were a couple ... let's say \"clumsy\" moments. And in a film that runs to three hours, that hardly seems like a significant issue, certainly not enough to rate it with fewer than 9 stars.This film has everything. There is dramatic tension right from the start. There is a magnificent story arc that picks up quite seamlessly from 'Man of Steel' and propels the viewer not only into the life of Clark Kent/Superman but also of Bruce Wayne/Batman.The villain is no mere cartoon of a villain; he is truly thoroughly (and apparently irrevocably) diabolical. He is a psychopath, and you wish for his death over and over and over. You want Superman to reduce him to ash with the power of his eyes.I have read a number of viewers' reviews, and it seems that the people who disliked the film / gave it a low rating had rather unfair and unrealistic expectations of it. That is, their own prejudices about how the plot could/should unfold or what the character development could/should be, etc. ruined the film for them. And that is a shame.My thought is: I settle into my seat, wait for the lights to dim, and then I wait to be transported by the film. I accept it, lock, stock, and barrel.As another reviewer remarked, I love how the film begins from the point of view of Bruce Wayne as he is among people on the ground who have fallen victim to the attack of Zod and the other Kryptonians.Why would Bruce Wayne not like Superman? Why would the good people of Earth hurl insults at Superman and burn him in effigy (on the news)? Because the good people of Earth just got catapulted into a new reality in which there are not only extraterrestrial beings (surprise!) but they are also superman! And a group of them are hell-bent on destroying humankind and taking the planet for themselves.It is difficult to see Superman as separate from the whole Kryptonian Krew.It seems that many moviegoers forgot that Bruce Wayne is also human. Sure, he's a hero, but he is flawed.. Just like the rest of us. He is a vigilante, after all.He has let his vigilantism get the better of him. HE is actually the one working outside the boundaries of the law, not Superman. It is the clear head of Alfred that shows us that he has gone into a rather dark place, that he has not seen what is really going on (in Luthor's scheme), and so he chooses to embark on his own scheme scheme to take out the alien invader. He is (allegedly) thinking of the future: if he wipes out the all-powerful alien, then it can't turn on humankind in the future. At least, he convinces himself of that.A philosophical question is raised in the film: should Clark Kent have remained a simple man from Kansas and never have become the Superman? Should he just let people die and let calamities happen? The question is answered for us in the character of Diana Prince/Wonder Woman. She withdrew from mankind (her exact words) and just sat around watching. Watching while people died horrible deaths all around her. So, should Superman have done the same? Do these special beings, these 'metahumans', have some kind of moral imperative to intervene, or should they be allowed to be regular people, too? It seems that humans want it both ways.It seems that humans are saying: \"Don't be a superalien ... except when I and my friends and family are in trouble. Then come save us.\""

"Batman v Superman: Ultimate Edition: If your looking for a quick, cheap thrill then you might not enjoy this film at the time. This movies theatrical version was butchered by WB and in doing so reshaped the story leaving numerous plot holes. So the Ultimate Edition is the full story and the one worth seeing. Watch 'Man of Steel' before seeing this movie. There is much to claw through here, so much so that the audience might easily find themselves exhausted from the overall aggression of the film. However, a lot of the story does work. The action is good, and the emotion feels real most of the time.This film is about Superman trying to become Superman. Trying to help the world, save people, find a place in this world not as an outcast, and yet is looked at has a threat by many. Superman is not from this world, yet He is trying to be human, find a place in this world, be excepted by earths people, and come into his destiny.This film is also about Batman being Batman for 20 years and losing faith in humanity, and fearing Superman, what Superman can do with his powers. Great film, great plot, great visuals. ---Yidioo"
"I didn't see the film in the theaters and just bought the \"Extended Edition \" on Amazon. I never properly saw Man of Steel- i think I rented it and watched it when already exhausted and fell asleep. I saw the mediocre user reviews and horrible reviews from critics of this film.They really have it wrong. This is the very best either Batman or Superman. It has a different take, on things. Much darker then earlier films even darker then the Christopher Nolan Batman films.First of all Christopher Nolan is an Executive Producer. So how bad could it be? I loved Sucker Punch and Zack Snyder was involved with that. So how bad could this be? Hans Zimmer did the music, so how bad could it be?I remember watching the old Superman TV shows and reading the Superman and Batman comics as a little kid and loved them, but i wouldn't call myself a \"fan boy\" of comic universes, like so many younger people today. As an older adult I will admit my favorite TV show of all time was Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but watched it on DVD only after it had finished. I saw the second of the Dark Knight series in the theater, but the other two, I watched on DVD. They were great, but not my favorite films like so many people. i also loved the first couple Superman and Batman films in the older series. Regardless, i was not waiting with baited breath to see Man of Steel or this one.I'm more of a serious film fan, who can watch Stanley Kubrick films over and over and my favorite films in the last twenty years, are Eyes Wide Shut and Intersteller, both of which i've watched multiple times.So, with that said, take it from me, the critics have this film very wrong, just as critics hated 2001: A Space Odyssey when it first came out. This film will have lasting appreciation.Surprised how much I liked Ben Afleck's Batman. it was hard to get into Henry Cavil's scrawnier looking Superman, but it grew on me. Amy Adams was great as Lois Lane, The Gal Gadol Wonder Women was amazing. Lex Luther was terrific, like Nolan's Joker. Jeremy Irons was the best Alfred ever. Holly Hunter and Diane Lane was good too. The movie had bad reviews but made a billion dollars. Hopefully everyone buys the Ultimate Edition and it breaks sales records and the film is re-appreciated. I have no idea what scenes this Ultimate Edition added, but it is pretty perfect. Now I can't wait for Wonder Woman and the Justice League and as soon as I finish writing this am going to watch Man of Steal. I'm into it now!I can only surmise that the bad reviews stem from too much expectations of the rigid fan boy types and the radical changes in tone, we see in this film.Total masterpiece of cinema, but I have a few criticisms. There are a few hollow scenes of typical Idiot cops and authorities getting everything wrong in a cliché type way and it has a few filler scenes of that type and a few moments here and there that felt rushed and cheesy. Maybe not everything restored into the Ultimate Edition should have been. I wish there had been more Kevin Costner scenes."

"The whole entire Batman V Superman movie was great and yes even though it felt slow to the majority of the people who watched it but to me I enjoyed every part and every scene of Batman V Superman and when it got to the fight scenes both batman VS Superman and the Doomsday fight it brought so much drama, intensity, and epic performances. So with that being said I give this movie a good 10/10 because it really did go to my expectations and it brought a powerful performance and a powerful yet epic introduction to the upcoming Justice League."

"When I first wrote a review for this movie a year ago exclaiming my excitement for the film, I had been high off a fresh dose of live-action DC superheroes playing out the beloved comic book stories that I had grown up on. It was all playing out before my eyes and coming to life. After a few months had passed, I began to notice things about the movie that I disliked: little gaps in the story, things that didn't add up, etc. My original rating of a 10 / 10 dropped to an 8 /10. But today it has gone back up to a 10. The extended version of the film not only rectifies the gaps but also silences critics.Many claimed that the movie was too dark or that it just didn't make sense. To those people, I say: \"Pick up a comic book!\" Many of the critics of this particular film were part of the superhero bandwagon that formed when Marvel began its spree of Avengers-related films. In fact, its estimated that over 60% of people who go to see 'superhero' genre films have never picked up a comic book in their life. I would argue that similar numbers could figure to those which view the CW televised DC Universe shows. People complain that DC comics is just too dark but the fact is that these movies are based upon actual comics which are meant to be dark (ex: The Dark Knight Returns, Injustice, etc.). Its like complaining that Game of Thrones (the TV series) sucks because they kill off too many characters. Read the books! Its frustrating to see such a beautiful work of art like Batman V Superman criticized by those ignorant to its universe and its meaning. This movie is in fact a catalyst that opens numerous doorways and leaves true fans in awe of the possibilities for future movies. But regardless of whether or not people choose to educate themselves, this film's DVD/Blu-ray extended version puts the theater release to shame. All of the plot holes and gaps are filled in 30 minutes of extended footage scattered throughout the film. The movie ultimately becomes more complete and people will wish that the movie had shown the full 3 hours of footage in its theatrical debut. As a major DC comics fan, I will of course pick up on things that a comics fan would not, but someone who does not read comics would learn to appreciate this film in its entirety with the extended version. Get your hands on a copy today or find it on Netflix or the internet somewhere!"

"I ignored the bad reviews and watched anyways. This film had a lot to live up to after Civil War was released and I went into this film expecting the worst. It ended up to be the best Superhero film of 2016 to me. One complaint was that this film was more concerned about universe building than telling a great story than Civil War but for me it was the other way around; Civil War felt like a build up to something else and to be honest, I felt that way when I saw the other MCU films. Batman vs Superman however not only had a great story, but it also felt a lot more consistent than Civil War. This film was way more diverse with the cast than the MCU but unlike the MCU, I felt like this film doesn't go overboard with the SJW stuff like the MCU films or The Star Wars Sequel films do. The Visuals were AMAZING, The Score by Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL was AMAZING as well, The Tone is just right as I actually felt for the characters emotionally, The Cinematography kept my eyes glued to the screen, and the script felt really Intelligent and Complex and despite people calling the writing confusing, I was able to piece it together with no problem whatsoever. This film is similar to Empire Strikes back in terms of popularity so over time after the other movies are released, this movie would probably be more popular.This film was way better than I Expected and deserves another chance.

"Its shame to see what critics and marvel fans did to this movie and targeted Zack Snyder for it. I have seen this movie more than 25 times till date. And i enjoy this movie as much as i enjoyed the first time. The fans who have read DC comics, wouldn't be disappointed in this movie. Its dark movie, yes it is. Because the title shows the intense situation at hand. Two superheroes about to rip each other apart for whatever reasons that brought them to this stage. Yes it had to be dark and intense.Only marvel can be stupid enough to show an alien invasion where humans are loosing the battle and the super heroes are cracking jokes while battles as if they are playing ping pong. a person playing Call of Duty game is more serious while playing than the marvel heroes fighting aliens."

"Last week some news came out from somebody online who had claimed to have seen a finished version of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. If you were like me, you've been leery of checking it out because you weren't sure how much might actually be true. Now Zack Snyder has spoken out about the spoiler-filled post, although his response doesn't really clear anything up.In a word, to MTV, he called the post \"hilarious,which might imply that he's saying that it's mostly, if not entirely, untrue. That might be the case, but then again he could have just said it was untrue and he didn't say that. What he did say, however, is that he doesn't like spoilers. While this may seem odd for the director who's most recent trailer appeared to give away the entire movie, Snyder says that's not the case. Even if you've seen the trailer, you can rest easy, as there is much more we have not seen in then finished film. Says Snyder I have the benefit of seeing the movie. It's cool that think it's too much, and I appreciate people not wanting to know, but there's plenty that they don't know. There's a lot of movie that's not in the trailer. In the process of calling the Batman v Superman Reddit review hilarious, Snyder goes on to talk about how he hates it when spoilers come out. The director would much rather that fans see the movie mostly blind. While he understands that some fans may wish to find the answers before hand, he wants his movies to be mysteries going in. If you're, as an audience member, exploring these articles, looking for answers to questions that you have, maybe you're okay with knowing before you go. It's like an individual taste. But like I said, I want people to see the movie without knowing.Spoilers are a topic that mean different things to different people. While most try to avoid them to some degree, the need to solve the mystery is a nearly universal human experience. We have an inclination to want to know the truth, even while also wanting to be surprised. For most of us getting some information is good, but getting all the information is bad, of course, only getting the details that you want can be difficult."
"The theatrical is choppy, poorly edited, hard to follow, with some really good moments mixed in their. The extended is much more fluent and is much easier to follow, it does have a long runtime, which might make it seem a bit dragging on, but if you like long films done right, like Lord of the Rings, you will like this movie as long as you get into the characters and story. Speaking of which, the story starts out perfectly showing Bruce Wayne as a character, and it is very powerful. There are several moments in this movie that are powerful, emotional, and shocking. Characters. Batman is my favorite fictional character of all time, and believe me when I say, Ben Affleck as Batman was perfect, he had the charisma, the anger, and the look of being through some bad stuff Gal Gadot also does perfect as Wonder Woman, but if you want to really see how good she does, go watch the Wonder Woman movie. Henry Call as Superman. I really don't like it when people say Christopher Reeves is better. Don't get me wrong, Reeves does great, but can you imagine him as Superman in this movie? I wouldn't like it. It would be like Adam West playing Batman in The Dark Knight. Henry Cavill does great in this role, I can say everything about him as I said with Ben Affleck. Jesse Eisenberg as Luthor. I thought it was different in a good way. I've heard a criticism for him as being too much like Joker, but is that a bad thing? Joker is my favorite villain, so to see Superman have an enemy that crazy, but still hold the values Luthor needs to be Luthor, I think it is great. The thing I thought this movie was lacking in the first and second acts was humor, at least good humor. If there was more humor, I would've given this movie a ten because it would give a more relaxing feel to the parts that needed it. All in all though, this movie was awesome, it had powerful moments, it was badass, and just plain fun. It had a great story arc and does its job very well."

"*I will be talking about the Ultimate Edition of the film* This was one of the most anticipated CBM of all time. Ever since the arrival and subsequent success of Marvel's The Avengers people have wondered when will DC launch its own cinematic universe, one of the main reasons being the opportunity to finally see titans such as Batman and Superman share the screen together: the ultimate nerd dream. On 2016, the moment finally came for BvS to be released AND.. it performed poorly. Not only did critical reception left a lot to be desired, but fan reactions where surprisingly split after its cinematic debut. People either loved it and called Zack a genius, or hated it and called him a hack. Me, personally, I found myself with middle of the road feelings, for sure, but more leaning towards the negative side with subsequent viewings. The theatrical cut of the film showcased amazing performances, incredible visuals, and action set pieces that seemed like comic book panels come to life, in a good way. However, when it comes to its narrative structure and more technical aspects like editing, the film was seriously flawed. More plot holes than Age of Ultron, questionable character decisions, random editing that lacked cohesion and focus, and forced dramatic moments that lacked any impact because the attempts at character development ranged from limited to nonexistent, especially when it comes to Superman's character. I thought it was a 5/10 movie at best. As such, I was kind of skeptical about the idea of a 30 minute longer version. I say kind of because I know how Zack works. I remember Watchmen being vastly improved with its director's cut, so in a way I was expecting BvS to perform in a similar manner, but I also feared those 30 minutes wold be just there to amplify action and discredit storytelling issues. Oh boy, I'm so glad I was proved wrong. The ultimate cut of the film was infuriating, but not because it was awful, but because it questions the sanity of WB executives and editors and makes you wonder what were they thinking during the editing process. What I got out of the Ultimate Edition was a thought-provoking deconstruction of two very iconic superheroes that gave spotlight to the struggles both of them face when they aren't fighting crime. What I got was an extremely well produced character study on both Batman and Superman in a cynical world, a world dangerously close to our own. We meet Batman as a ruthless, worn out hero that has seen the failure behind his ideals and witnessed some truly horrifying things in his life. Superman, on the other hand, is portrayed as a godlike figure that seeks to do good in the world, but finds himself emotionally conflicted once he realized that every good deed he does leaves behind a trail of destruction (most of it due to Luthor's antics). In my opinion, this is a hugely original approach, one that distances itself from the rest of the competition and delivers a dark, somber, yet relevant superhero movie that understands both characters and gives them real human struggles to deal with. I felt invested in both of them, and hoped that by the end of the film both could find a way to redeem themselves. Their character arcs were very well established during the first two acts of the movie, and by the time we get to the titular climactic battle the emotion behind the jaw-dropping action is intensified. Lex Luthor as a villain was also given more time to develop with this new edition. One of the main criticisms with the original version was the fact that his plan relied too much on conveniences, and the character's mannerisms and mad-scientist attitude was annoying, and that goes without saying his motivations were unclear. Not only do we spend more time understanding his hate for any godlike figure and thus his hatred for Superman, but the added scenes allowed us to witness his entire plan come to fruition. It sells the cold, manipulative, calculating attributes of his comic counterpart. The acting is spot on. Every actor owns his/her role, from Cavill's Superman, to Ben Affleck as Batman, Eisenberg as Luthor, and Gadot as Wonder Woman, whose scenes are brief, but are more than enough to sell the strong and ferocious warrior that she is. Cinematography is stunning, and miles above that of Man of Steel's. And the soundtrack by Zimmer and Junkie XL? Perfect, just perfect. When it comes to flaws, the film still has some of those. The Martha moment, while serving as a pivotal character moment for Batman, felt off in execution, and its understandable that many people got mad at it. If your main complaint about BvS the first time around was its bleak tone and subject matter, this film is still not for you. I understand most were expecting to see the heroes being the most iconic versions of themselves, clashing in an elongated battle and evoking the same feelings The Avengers gave audiences back in 2012. In that sense, the film will remain divisive, but at least I have the comfort of saying that, at the very least, the film is competently made."

"This film was amazing. Ben Affleck was easily the best part of this movie, he brought his a-game as Batman. The chemistry between Affleck & Irons was outstanding. Gal Gadot did a great job as Wonder Woman. The fight between Batman & Superman was awesome. The final fight with Doomsday was outstanding in every way possible. However, there is only one problem with this film and that's Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor. He was sadly missed cast in this role, but then again it's really the fault of Warner Bros. Studios. Overall, this film deliver on almost every level. I highly recommend that you watch the extended version of this film."

"I know I know. I saw it in theaters too, and felt like it could've been so much better. While the Batman element was good, the narrative felt fractured, and the third act was just one long stunt scene. Superman was relegated to a supporting character, and other characters didn't get a chance to shine. And then I chanced on the ultimate cut. Calling it 30 mins of \"extra\" footage is unfair to Zack Snyder because it's exactly these 30 mins that makes the movie a worthy one. What I can say about the theatrical cut is this - It had the blockbuster elements - music, visuals, stunts, CGI. But, it lacked the human elements. The first 20 mins of the movie had it, but not after that. The extended cut in comparison has a flow to the narrative. There are no disjointed scenes, everything flows smoothly, and there's connective tissue. Superman gets to spend some time with his father, and mother. Clark Kent does some investigative journalism. Superman helps the people after the blast. Lois Lane doesn't jump to conclusions, she gets to the bottom of the crime. Lex Luthor apparently had a coherent plan - everything is explained pretty well. Wonder Woman was already good, so there's no change there :) Also, the \"Martha\" scene seems better executed, because it is a few seconds longer, and there's time to breathe it in. So, here's my take on this movie - The theatrical cut was junk. Get the Bluray for ultimate edition, and you shall not be disappointed. I've seen it so many more times now, and it's the definitive cut. It is the movie we deserve. It's a unique take on Batman, and Superman. It's a gritty take on the superhero movie genre, and definitely the best DCEU movie, and the best DC movie since The Dark Knight.P.S. Yes it's dark. We're adults, and we should appreciate mature film making without intentionally silly moments. It attempts to be philosophical, and something deep instead of just trying to make you chuckle."

"This is one of the best superhero movies ever made. Zack Snyder is a magician behind the camera.The reason behind so many complaints is the fact that Warner Bros. marketed this movie as a fight between Batman and Superman. That's not what it is. It's a movie about the origins of the Justice League.The cinematography, the acting and the score are all second to none. This film is phenomenal.P.S: watch the 3 hour extended cut that Snyder intended you to see, not the 2 and a half hour movie that Warner Bros. decided would be better for theaters."

"I don't care what the critics say, this is a very well-done movie. I'll start my review by listing what I like about the movie.1.) Ben Affleck is the best batman to me and it is not close. He pulls off the role of an aging batman extremely well. Also, Zack Snyder's vision of batman is legit. I have always hated batman up until this adaptation of him. Instead of being a conflicted and idealistic batman, this batman is dark, gritty, and 100% a badass. His equipment is decked out with machine guns and he has no aversion to killing people. In fact, he probably kills about 50 criminal by the time this movie is over. The warehouse scene is the coolest batman scene in any movie.2.) The development of a grudge between batman and superman is pulled off flawlessly. It actually makes sense why batman dislikes superman. Then, when they do fight it is about the coolest thing you can expect to see from a superhero film. 3.) I disagree with a lot of people about Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor. In my opinion, he played his role to perfection. 4.) B v S sets up Wonder Woman and Justice League with Gal Gadot's cameo as Wonder Woman and short clips of Aquaman, the Flash, and Cyborg. B v S is one of my favorite superhero films and rewatching it never gets old."

"The theatrical cut of this film is garbage which is why I rated it eight stars instead of nine. The first time I watched this film I didn't like it (not straight out hate but didn't like). Character motivations didn't make any sense, Lex was annoying as s***, editing was sloppy, and it was overly dark and broody for an action superhero movie. A year + a half, five Marvel films, a ton of bad reviews and a Justice League later a thought popped into my head: \"what if I watched BVS again\". This time I didn't have trailers ruining the best moments, I only vaguely remembered the film, and I was conditioned to look at it negatively but something unexpected happened: I actually loved it. Superman was just a normal person that tried to make a difference cause he could that others imposed their own beliefs on. Lex Luthor was a genius that couldn't stand his powerlessness compared to Superman or more accurately a super being. As Alfred said \"The fever, the rage, the feeling of powerlessness that turns good men... cruel\" and you see the same thought process in Batman. Batman, just like Lex Luthor feels powerless in the midst of a god-being and just like Lex he attempts to destroy him so he can get his sense of power back but unlike Lex, Batman learns something. I what is one of the corniest lines of the movie Superman says, \"Martha\" when he knows he can't win against Batman in a late desperate attempt to save his mother. Not only does this name connect with Bruce Wayne but it also shows what really matters to a man of steel: it isn't power, it isn't fame or anything else, it is his Mother and on a broader scale it is people. Lex (who doesn't care about people at all) knows he doesn't have the power so he creates something from his blood and the remains of Zod: A Doomsday for Superman. Not only does this film have depth but it also doesn't always explain it to you which is rare in a blockbuster action superhero flick normally cater to semi-comic book fans and people that want to shove popcorn in their mouths. This film rewards you for really noticing the details while still having massive explosions. One of my favorites is how Lex has all of Batman's branded killed which is why he isn't afraid of the branding at the end or Grandma's Peach Tea as a way of scaring the s*** out of someone. Of course, this film isn't perfect and I do have personal dislikes. The Batman V Superman fight was slow and pretty boring especially after watching such an amazing fight in Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 2 (If you haven't watched the animated Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 1 and 2 you are sorely missing out on something fantastic). Also, the addition of Wonder Woman who pretty much steals a hacker thing, gives it back and then suits up and fights against a giant monster thing. Not to say I don't like Wonder Woman (She is one of my favorite Superheroes of all time who showed not only can woman kick a** but they also don't need to be ashamed of their sexuality or gender) but she wasn't really that helpful to the plot and just brought in to expand the universe which was well done through Lex's superhuman hunting files. Also, the post-apocalyptic scene that was just a dream could have been cut but nothing is perfect except movies like Citizen Kane which isn't a lot of fun to watch cause it is too perfect. So to summarize, the theatrical cut is bad, the ultimate cut is Amazing and the other cut is meh. Please give it a second chance because it deserves it and save a good director from losing grace because of something he didn't do."
"I really liked it, don't know what all the hate is about. I'm actually a Marvel fan from when I was 7 or so, but Superman and Batman together in 1 movie? Just great. And personally I like Ben Affleck even better than Christian Bale as Batman. So just watch and enjoy, I know I did!"

"That's right. We have been waiting for these two heroes to finally meet and fight against each other. This movie is so good in both plot and special effects.Henry Cavill and Ben Affleck have performed well in their acting stages. They are the best superhero actors and they have filmed their fighting scenes very well. The movie starts to show the conflict between the lives of the heroes and now they have blamed each other for it. This movie is amazing and sets up a good plot for Dawn Justice."

"Actually...I didn't know what to expect. When you see Wonder Woman, you know it will be off of Wonder Woman and off of a Wonder Woman story, but with Batman V Superman, I was like, \"hmmmm, so who is this about?\" It was pretty obvious that it would feature many characters, but I thought the introduction to Batman was amazing. Ben Affleck nailed the part, not only as Batman but also as Bruce Wayne. He is my Batman. Henry Cavill continued to be super as the Man of Steel. And he is my Super - Man. A dark story? Yes, without a doubt. Could it have had a few more jokes? Sure. But not all movies or stories need to have jokes when certain events are serious. I really hope people can see this review and take another look at the movie, because, I loved it. I really hope the ratings can go up, eventually. And P.S, this movie is the perfect set up to Justice League."

"I'll start by making it clear I have only ever seen the Ultimate Edition. I'm aware of what was cut out for the theatrical release, so I will concede up front that most of the criticisms about pacing, editing, and missing bits of plot at release were merited.With that caveat out of the way, I must reiterate that this was bar-none the boldest superhero movie I have ever seen. To me, it was arguably the best as well, though \"best\" shouldn't be taken to mean \"most enjoyable.\" That honor easily goes to \"Thor: Ragnarok.\" What makes BvS stand out among other films in the genre is that it takes two characters who have been done to death since the 1970s and brings them up to date. I recently tried to watch \"Superman: The Movie\" for the first time in a number of years, and while it was still good and Reeves will always be iconic, I just couldn't take it seriously. I'll put it this way: If the story in BvS was \"stupid\" in your view but Superman turning back time by spinning the earth backward on its axis didn't seem like one of the dumbest things you have ever seen -in any movie from any genre- to the extent that it outright ruins the movie for you, then your opinion about BvS isn't worth much. Nostalgic bias was always going to be a problem for this movie, and the way people reacted to and reviewed \"Man of Steel\" was telling in this regard.That brings me to Zack Snyder's take on Superman. You know, that guy whose status as the first extraterrestrial ever encountered by humanity was a total non-issue in the old movies. Apparently, Snyder has a similar view to my own in that his take on the Man of Steel makes his being an alien a core piece of his identity. He may look like any other (absurdly attractive) person, but he knows what he is, and that makes him perpetually uncertain of where he fits in this world. He is essentially good and really does care about people, but he struggles to truly empathize with the likes of us. To be human is to be frail, and that is not something he can easily relate to. This is the root of his conflict with Batman.Just as Clark struggles to genuinely relate to most people, Snyder's Batman either refuses to or otherwise just can't relate to Superman. He doesn't see him as anything but a threat regardless of Superman's clear good intentions. Remember, a small group of Kryptonians were able to bring humanity to the brink of extinction in less than a day, and Bruce Wayne is nothing if not a realist. He didn't know the guy from Kansas. He only knew the god from another world.While Batman's anger toward and fear of Superman are readily apparent from the start, Superman's inability to imagine things from Bruce Wayne's perspective only becomes truly apparent during their first real interaction. This reminded me of the animated version of the \"world's finest\" storyline, where Superman judges Batman harshly for using fear tactics and threats of violence (also, actual violence) to get the job done. Superman wasn't willing to consider what it would take for a human man to fight criminals and save innocents, or what that life would do to him over time. Just as Batman didn't see the guy from Kansas, Superman didn't see the man who lives his life trapped in one brutal, unthinkably traumatic moment (this was beautifully conveyed during the film's opening moments), and had spent his whole adult life bearing witness to humanity at its absolute worst.The conflict between these two characters is as old as human history. They want the same things, but they can't understand one another. So they fight. And what a fight it was.Watching a fight between, say, Captain America and Iron Man was, to me, more frustrating than anything because each understood the other's perspective perfectly. The fight between Batman and Superman in BvS was genuinely gut-wrenching, as intended, because they would have understood one another if either had tried. The whole sequence hilighted Batman's tactical prowess and ability to control a situation. Maybe the most badass thing about the fight was that it ended exactly where Batman planned. That brings me to the big elephant in the room named \"Martha.\"I can't recall exactly which YouTuber put it this way, but if you thought the \"save Martha\" exchange was about their mothers having the same name, you had your brain turned off. The brain-on people have explained this to death, but it bears repeating. This was the moment when Superman became humanized to Batman. He was about to die, and his only concern was for his adoptive human mother. He still believed that the man about to take his life would do the right thing. Even with the cowl on, there was no mistaking the look on Batman's face. It was the look of shame, guilt, and sudden uncertainty that says \"What am I doing?\" Turns out even the most brutal, angry version of Bruce Wayne is better than Tony Stark at knowing right from wrong. At knowing that he had gone too far.From there, the third act was a series of truly impressive (albeit mostly CGI) fight sequences, beginning with what I regard as the undisputed champion of Batman fights. Nothing in the Nolan movies (and especially nothing in the Burton movies) even came close. Go ahead, try to convince yourself that Batman and Bane taking turns punching one another in the face until Bane's mask broke was a good fight sequence. No, this was a fight straight out of \"Arkham Knight,\" and it was glorious. The battle against Doomsday really was one for the books. From the moment Wonder Woman arrived accompanied by the intense sounds of Tina Guo's electric cello to Superman's tragic, heroic death at the hands of Doomsday, I was glued to the screen. Sure, the mere presence of Doomsday spoiled the end to a degree, but watching the Man of Steel laboring to carry that kryptonite spear towards certain death was no less impactful. A brief word on Jesse Eisenberg's take on Lex Luthor. At least one other reviewer on this site already said it best when they pointed out that this was his origin story. If you consider his scheme objectively, he is actually one of the more formidable incarnations of the character. If we're lucky, we'll eventually get to see a Snyder Cut of \"Justice League\" and find out where this story was actually meant to go. For the record, Joss Whedon and Danny Elfman both should have said \"no\" to taking a dump on someone else's art."
"BATMAN V SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE brings a fantastic surprise to a smash-hit team-up with one of the worlds most beloved DC Comics' icons of all time. The movie delivers spectacular casting, and fantastic acting with different characters having their shine in each scenes.The story follows Clark Kent/Superman who becomes a threat, after the destruction in Metropolis in Man Of Steel.(2013). Batman/Bruce Wayne sees him as a threat and begins his war on Superman.The movie brings spectacular storytelling, it tells the complications of human against alien who are on the same side, and the first meeting of Batman and Superman. The story of Bruce Wayne, with his many years of The Caped Crusader, sends him on a spiral of \"out of control\", sheer anger, and builds tension to wanting to defeat the Man of Steel. Snyder has fantastically gave this storytelling an exciting nod to the comics.Lex Luthor, played by Jesse Einsberg, delivers a very interesting performance, but very differently by him showing is his \"origin\" before he becomes a bald foe to the Man of Steel. He shows that his love of \"god vs man\" terrorises mankind when he ultimately creates Doomsday, and Batman realises Superman's inner heroism.It packs so many great \"out of nowhere\" excitement, including a first-look of the fearful Wonder Woman a.k.a. Diana Prince, played by Gal Gadot, and a fresh-new glimpse of the superhero DC canon: The Justice League.WATCH THIS MOVIE! The critics are out of their mind. It's a fun-packed action adventure which still keeps the movie enjoyable until it's final minutes of the movie. It's a FANTASTIC MOVIE! BEN AFFLECK AS BATMAN... is Incredible!A 10/10 overall!"
"I want to go on record as saying that this is a truly thrilling cinematic experience in so many ways. If pressed, I guess I could acknowledge that there were a couple ... let's say \"clumsy\" moments. And in a film that runs to three hours, that hardly seems like a significant issue, certainly not enough to rate it with fewer than 9 stars.This film has everything. There is dramatic tension right from the start. There is a magnificent story arc that picks up quite seamlessly from 'Man of Steel' and propels the viewer not only into the life of Clark Kent/Superman but also of Bruce Wayne/Batman.The villain is no mere cartoon of a villain; he is truly thoroughly (and apparently irrevocably) diabolical. He is a psychopath, and you wish for his death over and over and over. You want Superman to reduce him to ash with the power of his eyes.I have read a number of viewers' reviews, and it seems that the people who disliked the film / gave it a low rating had rather unfair and unrealistic expectations of it. That is, their own prejudices about how the plot could/should unfold or what the character development could/should be, etc. ruined the film for them. And that is a shame.My thought is: I settle into my seat, wait for the lights to dim, and then I wait to be transported by the film. I accept it, lock, stock, and barrel.As another reviewer remarked, I love how the film begins from the point of view of Bruce Wayne as he is among people on the ground who have fallen victim to the attack of Zod and the other Kryptonians.Why would Bruce Wayne not like Superman? Why would the good people of Earth hurl insults at Superman and burn him in effigy (on the news)? Because the good people of Earth just got catapulted into a new reality in which there are not only extraterrestrial beings (surprise!) but they are also superman! And a group of them are hell-bent on destroying humankind and taking the planet for themselves.It is difficult to see Superman as separate from the whole Kryptonian Krew.It seems that many moviegoers forgot that Bruce Wayne is also human. Sure, he's a hero, but he is flawed.. Just like the rest of us. He is a vigilante, after all.He has let his vigilantism get the better of him. HE is actually the one working outside the boundaries of the law, not Superman. It is the clear head of Alfred that shows us that he has gone into a rather dark place, that he has not seen what is really going on (in Luthor's scheme), and so he chooses to embark on his own scheme scheme to take out the alien invader. He is (allegedly) thinking of the future: if he wipes out the all-powerful alien, then it can't turn on humankind in the future. At least, he convinces himself of that.A philosophical question is raised in the film: should Clark Kent have remained a simple man from Kansas and never have become the Superman? Should he just let people die and let calamities happen? The question is answered for us in the character of Diana Prince/Wonder Woman. She withdrew from mankind (her exact words) and just sat around watching. Watching while people died horrible deaths all around her. So, should Superman have done the same? Do these special beings, these 'metahumans', have some kind of moral imperative to intervene, or should they be allowed to be regular people, too? It seems that humans want it both ways.It seems that humans are saying: \"Don't be a superalien ... except when I and my friends and family are in trouble. Then come save us.\""

"Batman v Superman: Ultimate Edition: If your looking for a quick, cheap thrill then you might not enjoy this film at the time. This movies theatrical version was butchered by WB and in doing so reshaped the story leaving numerous plot holes. So the Ultimate Edition is the full story and the one worth seeing. Watch 'Man of Steel' before seeing this movie. There is much to claw through here, so much so that the audience might easily find themselves exhausted from the overall aggression of the film. However, a lot of the story does work. The action is good, and the emotion feels real most of the time.This film is about Superman trying to become Superman. Trying to help the world, save people, find a place in this world not as an outcast, and yet is looked at has a threat by many. Superman is not from this world, yet He is trying to be human, find a place in this world, be excepted by earths people, and come into his destiny.This film is also about Batman being Batman for 20 years and losing faith in humanity, and fearing Superman, what Superman can do with his powers. Great film, great plot, great visuals. ---Yidioo"
"I didn't see the film in the theaters and just bought the \"Extended Edition \" on Amazon. I never properly saw Man of Steel- i think I rented it and watched it when already exhausted and fell asleep. I saw the mediocre user reviews and horrible reviews from critics of this film.They really have it wrong. This is the very best either Batman or Superman. It has a different take, on things. Much darker then earlier films even darker then the Christopher Nolan Batman films.First of all Christopher Nolan is an Executive Producer. So how bad could it be? I loved Sucker Punch and Zack Snyder was involved with that. So how bad could this be? Hans Zimmer did the music, so how bad could it be?I remember watching the old Superman TV shows and reading the Superman and Batman comics as a little kid and loved them, but i wouldn't call myself a \"fan boy\" of comic universes, like so many younger people today. As an older adult I will admit my favorite TV show of all time was Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but watched it on DVD only after it had finished. I saw the second of the Dark Knight series in the theater, but the other two, I watched on DVD. They were great, but not my favorite films like so many people. i also loved the first couple Superman and Batman films in the older series. Regardless, i was not waiting with baited breath to see Man of Steel or this one.I'm more of a serious film fan, who can watch Stanley Kubrick films over and over and my favorite films in the last twenty years, are Eyes Wide Shut and Intersteller, both of which i've watched multiple times.So, with that said, take it from me, the critics have this film very wrong, just as critics hated 2001: A Space Odyssey when it first came out. This film will have lasting appreciation.Surprised how much I liked Ben Afleck's Batman. it was hard to get into Henry Cavil's scrawnier looking Superman, but it grew on me. Amy Adams was great as Lois Lane, The Gal Gadol Wonder Women was amazing. Lex Luther was terrific, like Nolan's Joker. Jeremy Irons was the best Alfred ever. Holly Hunter and Diane Lane was good too. The movie had bad reviews but made a billion dollars. Hopefully everyone buys the Ultimate Edition and it breaks sales records and the film is re-appreciated. I have no idea what scenes this Ultimate Edition added, but it is pretty perfect. Now I can't wait for Wonder Woman and the Justice League and as soon as I finish writing this am going to watch Man of Steal. I'm into it now!I can only surmise that the bad reviews stem from too much expectations of the rigid fan boy types and the radical changes in tone, we see in this film.Total masterpiece of cinema, but I have a few criticisms. There are a few hollow scenes of typical Idiot cops and authorities getting everything wrong in a cliché type way and it has a few filler scenes of that type and a few moments here and there that felt rushed and cheesy. Maybe not everything restored into the Ultimate Edition should have been. I wish there had been more Kevin Costner scenes."

"The whole entire Batman V Superman movie was great and yes even though it felt slow to the majority of the people who watched it but to me I enjoyed every part and every scene of Batman V Superman and when it got to the fight scenes both batman VS Superman and the Doomsday fight it brought so much drama, intensity, and epic performances. So with that being said I give this movie a good 10/10 because it really did go to my expectations and it brought a powerful performance and a powerful yet epic introduction to the upcoming Justice League."

"When I first wrote a review for this movie a year ago exclaiming my excitement for the film, I had been high off a fresh dose of live-action DC superheroes playing out the beloved comic book stories that I had grown up on. It was all playing out before my eyes and coming to life. After a few months had passed, I began to notice things about the movie that I disliked: little gaps in the story, things that didn't add up, etc. My original rating of a 10 / 10 dropped to an 8 /10. But today it has gone back up to a 10. The extended version of the film not only rectifies the gaps but also silences critics.Many claimed that the movie was too dark or that it just didn't make sense. To those people, I say: \"Pick up a comic book!\" Many of the critics of this particular film were part of the superhero bandwagon that formed when Marvel began its spree of Avengers-related films. In fact, its estimated that over 60% of people who go to see 'superhero' genre films have never picked up a comic book in their life. I would argue that similar numbers could figure to those which view the CW televised DC Universe shows. People complain that DC comics is just too dark but the fact is that these movies are based upon actual comics which are meant to be dark (ex: The Dark Knight Returns, Injustice, etc.). Its like complaining that Game of Thrones (the TV series) sucks because they kill off too many characters. Read the books! Its frustrating to see such a beautiful work of art like Batman V Superman criticized by those ignorant to its universe and its meaning. This movie is in fact a catalyst that opens numerous doorways and leaves true fans in awe of the possibilities for future movies. But regardless of whether or not people choose to educate themselves, this film's DVD/Blu-ray extended version puts the theater release to shame. All of the plot holes and gaps are filled in 30 minutes of extended footage scattered throughout the film. The movie ultimately becomes more complete and people will wish that the movie had shown the full 3 hours of footage in its theatrical debut. As a major DC comics fan, I will of course pick up on things that a comics fan would not, but someone who does not read comics would learn to appreciate this film in its entirety with the extended version. Get your hands on a copy today or find it on Netflix or the internet somewhere!"

"I ignored the bad reviews and watched anyways. This film had a lot to live up to after Civil War was released and I went into this film expecting the worst. It ended up to be the best Superhero film of 2016 to me. One complaint was that this film was more concerned about universe building than telling a great story than Civil War but for me it was the other way around; Civil War felt like a build up to something else and to be honest, I felt that way when I saw the other MCU films. Batman vs Superman however not only had a great story, but it also felt a lot more consistent than Civil War. This film was way more diverse with the cast than the MCU but unlike the MCU, I felt like this film doesn't go overboard with the SJW stuff like the MCU films or The Star Wars Sequel films do. The Visuals were AMAZING, The Score by Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL was AMAZING as well, The Tone is just right as I actually felt for the characters emotionally, The Cinematography kept my eyes glued to the screen, and the script felt really Intelligent and Complex and despite people calling the writing confusing, I was able to piece it together with no problem whatsoever. This film is similar to Empire Strikes back in terms of popularity so over time after the other movies are released, this movie would probably be more popular.This film was way better than I Expected and deserves another chance.

"Its shame to see what critics and marvel fans did to this movie and targeted Zack Snyder for it. I have seen this movie more than 25 times till date. And i enjoy this movie as much as i enjoyed the first time. The fans who have read DC comics, wouldn't be disappointed in this movie. Its dark movie, yes it is. Because the title shows the intense situation at hand. Two superheroes about to rip each other apart for whatever reasons that brought them to this stage. Yes it had to be dark and intense.Only marvel can be stupid enough to show an alien invasion where humans are loosing the battle and the super heroes are cracking jokes while battles as if they are playing ping pong. a person playing Call of Duty game is more serious while playing than the marvel heroes fighting aliens."

"Last week some news came out from somebody online who had claimed to have seen a finished version of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. If you were like me, you've been leery of checking it out because you weren't sure how much might actually be true. Now Zack Snyder has spoken out about the spoiler-filled post, although his response doesn't really clear anything up.In a word, to MTV, he called the post \"hilarious,which might imply that he's saying that it's mostly, if not entirely, untrue. That might be the case, but then again he could have just said it was untrue and he didn't say that. What he did say, however, is that he doesn't like spoilers. While this may seem odd for the director who's most recent trailer appeared to give away the entire movie, Snyder says that's not the case. Even if you've seen the trailer, you can rest easy, as there is much more we have not seen in then finished film. Says Snyder I have the benefit of seeing the movie. It's cool that think it's too much, and I appreciate people not wanting to know, but there's plenty that they don't know. There's a lot of movie that's not in the trailer. In the process of calling the Batman v Superman Reddit review hilarious, Snyder goes on to talk about how he hates it when spoilers come out. The director would much rather that fans see the movie mostly blind. While he understands that some fans may wish to find the answers before hand, he wants his movies to be mysteries going in. If you're, as an audience member, exploring these articles, looking for answers to questions that you have, maybe you're okay with knowing before you go. It's like an individual taste. But like I said, I want people to see the movie without knowing.Spoilers are a topic that mean different things to different people. While most try to avoid them to some degree, the need to solve the mystery is a nearly universal human experience. We have an inclination to want to know the truth, even while also wanting to be surprised. For most of us getting some information is good, but getting all the information is bad, of course, only getting the details that you want can be difficult."
"The theatrical is choppy, poorly edited, hard to follow, with some really good moments mixed in their. The extended is much more fluent and is much easier to follow, it does have a long runtime, which might make it seem a bit dragging on, but if you like long films done right, like Lord of the Rings, you will like this movie as long as you get into the characters and story. Speaking of which, the story starts out perfectly showing Bruce Wayne as a character, and it is very powerful. There are several moments in this movie that are powerful, emotional, and shocking. Characters. Batman is my favorite fictional character of all time, and believe me when I say, Ben Affleck as Batman was perfect, he had the charisma, the anger, and the look of being through some bad stuff Gal Gadot also does perfect as Wonder Woman, but if you want to really see how good she does, go watch the Wonder Woman movie. Henry Call as Superman. I really don't like it when people say Christopher Reeves is better. Don't get me wrong, Reeves does great, but can you imagine him as Superman in this movie? I wouldn't like it. It would be like Adam West playing Batman in The Dark Knight. Henry Cavill does great in this role, I can say everything about him as I said with Ben Affleck. Jesse Eisenberg as Luthor. I thought it was different in a good way. I've heard a criticism for him as being too much like Joker, but is that a bad thing? Joker is my favorite villain, so to see Superman have an enemy that crazy, but still hold the values Luthor needs to be Luthor, I think it is great. The thing I thought this movie was lacking in the first and second acts was humor, at least good humor. If there was more humor, I would've given this movie a ten because it would give a more relaxing feel to the parts that needed it. All in all though, this movie was awesome, it had powerful moments, it was badass, and just plain fun. It had a great story arc and does its job very well."

"*I will be talking about the Ultimate Edition of the film* This was one of the most anticipated CBM of all time. Ever since the arrival and subsequent success of Marvel's The Avengers people have wondered when will DC launch its own cinematic universe, one of the main reasons being the opportunity to finally see titans such as Batman and Superman share the screen together: the ultimate nerd dream. On 2016, the moment finally came for BvS to be released AND.. it performed poorly. Not only did critical reception left a lot to be desired, but fan reactions where surprisingly split after its cinematic debut. People either loved it and called Zack a genius, or hated it and called him a hack. Me, personally, I found myself with middle of the road feelings, for sure, but more leaning towards the negative side with subsequent viewings. The theatrical cut of the film showcased amazing performances, incredible visuals, and action set pieces that seemed like comic book panels come to life, in a good way. However, when it comes to its narrative structure and more technical aspects like editing, the film was seriously flawed. More plot holes than Age of Ultron, questionable character decisions, random editing that lacked cohesion and focus, and forced dramatic moments that lacked any impact because the attempts at character development ranged from limited to nonexistent, especially when it comes to Superman's character. I thought it was a 5/10 movie at best. As such, I was kind of skeptical about the idea of a 30 minute longer version. I say kind of because I know how Zack works. I remember Watchmen being vastly improved with its director's cut, so in a way I was expecting BvS to perform in a similar manner, but I also feared those 30 minutes wold be just there to amplify action and discredit storytelling issues. Oh boy, I'm so glad I was proved wrong. The ultimate cut of the film was infuriating, but not because it was awful, but because it questions the sanity of WB executives and editors and makes you wonder what were they thinking during the editing process. What I got out of the Ultimate Edition was a thought-provoking deconstruction of two very iconic superheroes that gave spotlight to the struggles both of them face when they aren't fighting crime. What I got was an extremely well produced character study on both Batman and Superman in a cynical world, a world dangerously close to our own. We meet Batman as a ruthless, worn out hero that has seen the failure behind his ideals and witnessed some truly horrifying things in his life. Superman, on the other hand, is portrayed as a godlike figure that seeks to do good in the world, but finds himself emotionally conflicted once he realized that every good deed he does leaves behind a trail of destruction (most of it due to Luthor's antics). In my opinion, this is a hugely original approach, one that distances itself from the rest of the competition and delivers a dark, somber, yet relevant superhero movie that understands both characters and gives them real human struggles to deal with. I felt invested in both of them, and hoped that by the end of the film both could find a way to redeem themselves. Their character arcs were very well established during the first two acts of the movie, and by the time we get to the titular climactic battle the emotion behind the jaw-dropping action is intensified. Lex Luthor as a villain was also given more time to develop with this new edition. One of the main criticisms with the original version was the fact that his plan relied too much on conveniences, and the character's mannerisms and mad-scientist attitude was annoying, and that goes without saying his motivations were unclear. Not only do we spend more time understanding his hate for any godlike figure and thus his hatred for Superman, but the added scenes allowed us to witness his entire plan come to fruition. It sells the cold, manipulative, calculating attributes of his comic counterpart. The acting is spot on. Every actor owns his/her role, from Cavill's Superman, to Ben Affleck as Batman, Eisenberg as Luthor, and Gadot as Wonder Woman, whose scenes are brief, but are more than enough to sell the strong and ferocious warrior that she is. Cinematography is stunning, and miles above that of Man of Steel's. And the soundtrack by Zimmer and Junkie XL? Perfect, just perfect. When it comes to flaws, the film still has some of those. The Martha moment, while serving as a pivotal character moment for Batman, felt off in execution, and its understandable that many people got mad at it. If your main complaint about BvS the first time around was its bleak tone and subject matter, this film is still not for you. I understand most were expecting to see the heroes being the most iconic versions of themselves, clashing in an elongated battle and evoking the same feelings The Avengers gave audiences back in 2012. In that sense, the film will remain divisive, but at least I have the comfort of saying that, at the very least, the film is competently made."

"This film was amazing. Ben Affleck was easily the best part of this movie, he brought his a-game as Batman. The chemistry between Affleck & Irons was outstanding. Gal Gadot did a great job as Wonder Woman. The fight between Batman & Superman was awesome. The final fight with Doomsday was outstanding in every way possible. However, there is only one problem with this film and that's Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor. He was sadly missed cast in this role, but then again it's really the fault of Warner Bros. Studios. Overall, this film deliver on almost every level. I highly recommend that you watch the extended version of this film."

"I know I know. I saw it in theaters too, and felt like it could've been so much better. While the Batman element was good, the narrative felt fractured, and the third act was just one long stunt scene. Superman was relegated to a supporting character, and other characters didn't get a chance to shine. And then I chanced on the ultimate cut. Calling it 30 mins of \"extra\" footage is unfair to Zack Snyder because it's exactly these 30 mins that makes the movie a worthy one. What I can say about the theatrical cut is this - It had the blockbuster elements - music, visuals, stunts, CGI. But, it lacked the human elements. The first 20 mins of the movie had it, but not after that. The extended cut in comparison has a flow to the narrative. There are no disjointed scenes, everything flows smoothly, and there's connective tissue. Superman gets to spend some time with his father, and mother. Clark Kent does some investigative journalism. Superman helps the people after the blast. Lois Lane doesn't jump to conclusions, she gets to the bottom of the crime. Lex Luthor apparently had a coherent plan - everything is explained pretty well. Wonder Woman was already good, so there's no change there :) Also, the \"Martha\" scene seems better executed, because it is a few seconds longer, and there's time to breathe it in. So, here's my take on this movie - The theatrical cut was junk. Get the Bluray for ultimate edition, and you shall not be disappointed. I've seen it so many more times now, and it's the definitive cut. It is the movie we deserve. It's a unique take on Batman, and Superman. It's a gritty take on the superhero movie genre, and definitely the best DCEU movie, and the best DC movie since The Dark Knight.P.S. Yes it's dark. We're adults, and we should appreciate mature film making without intentionally silly moments. It attempts to be philosophical, and something deep instead of just trying to make you chuckle."

"This is one of the best superhero movies ever made. Zack Snyder is a magician behind the camera.The reason behind so many complaints is the fact that Warner Bros. marketed this movie as a fight between Batman and Superman. That's not what it is. It's a movie about the origins of the Justice League.The cinematography, the acting and the score are all second to none. This film is phenomenal.P.S: watch the 3 hour extended cut that Snyder intended you to see, not the 2 and a half hour movie that Warner Bros. decided would be better for theaters."

"I don't care what the critics say, this is a very well-done movie. I'll start my review by listing what I like about the movie.1.) Ben Affleck is the best batman to me and it is not close. He pulls off the role of an aging batman extremely well. Also, Zack Snyder's vision of batman is legit. I have always hated batman up until this adaptation of him. Instead of being a conflicted and idealistic batman, this batman is dark, gritty, and 100% a badass. His equipment is decked out with machine guns and he has no aversion to killing people. In fact, he probably kills about 50 criminal by the time this movie is over. The warehouse scene is the coolest batman scene in any movie.2.) The development of a grudge between batman and superman is pulled off flawlessly. It actually makes sense why batman dislikes superman. Then, when they do fight it is about the coolest thing you can expect to see from a superhero film. 3.) I disagree with a lot of people about Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor. In my opinion, he played his role to perfection. 4.) B v S sets up Wonder Woman and Justice League with Gal Gadot's cameo as Wonder Woman and short clips of Aquaman, the Flash, and Cyborg. B v S is one of my favorite superhero films and rewatching it never gets old."

"The theatrical cut of this film is garbage which is why I rated it eight stars instead of nine. The first time I watched this film I didn't like it (not straight out hate but didn't like). Character motivations didn't make any sense, Lex was annoying as s***, editing was sloppy, and it was overly dark and broody for an action superhero movie. A year + a half, five Marvel films, a ton of bad reviews and a Justice League later a thought popped into my head: \"what if I watched BVS again\". This time I didn't have trailers ruining the best moments, I only vaguely remembered the film, and I was conditioned to look at it negatively but something unexpected happened: I actually loved it. Superman was just a normal person that tried to make a difference cause he could that others imposed their own beliefs on. Lex Luthor was a genius that couldn't stand his powerlessness compared to Superman or more accurately a super being. As Alfred said \"The fever, the rage, the feeling of powerlessness that turns good men... cruel\" and you see the same thought process in Batman. Batman, just like Lex Luthor feels powerless in the midst of a god-being and just like Lex he attempts to destroy him so he can get his sense of power back but unlike Lex, Batman learns something. I what is one of the corniest lines of the movie Superman says, \"Martha\" when he knows he can't win against Batman in a late desperate attempt to save his mother. Not only does this name connect with Bruce Wayne but it also shows what really matters to a man of steel: it isn't power, it isn't fame or anything else, it is his Mother and on a broader scale it is people. Lex (who doesn't care about people at all) knows he doesn't have the power so he creates something from his blood and the remains of Zod: A Doomsday for Superman. Not only does this film have depth but it also doesn't always explain it to you which is rare in a blockbuster action superhero flick normally cater to semi-comic book fans and people that want to shove popcorn in their mouths. This film rewards you for really noticing the details while still having massive explosions. One of my favorites is how Lex has all of Batman's branded killed which is why he isn't afraid of the branding at the end or Grandma's Peach Tea as a way of scaring the s*** out of someone. Of course, this film isn't perfect and I do have personal dislikes. The Batman V Superman fight was slow and pretty boring especially after watching such an amazing fight in Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 2 (If you haven't watched the animated Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 1 and 2 you are sorely missing out on something fantastic). Also, the addition of Wonder Woman who pretty much steals a hacker thing, gives it back and then suits up and fights against a giant monster thing. Not to say I don't like Wonder Woman (She is one of my favorite Superheroes of all time who showed not only can woman kick a** but they also don't need to be ashamed of their sexuality or gender) but she wasn't really that helpful to the plot and just brought in to expand the universe which was well done through Lex's superhuman hunting files. Also, the post-apocalyptic scene that was just a dream could have been cut but nothing is perfect except movies like Citizen Kane which isn't a lot of fun to watch cause it is too perfect. So to summarize, the theatrical cut is bad, the ultimate cut is Amazing and the other cut is meh. Please give it a second chance because it deserves it and save a good director from losing grace because of something he didn't do."
"I really liked it, don't know what all the hate is about. I'm actually a Marvel fan from when I was 7 or so, but Superman and Batman together in 1 movie? Just great. And personally I like Ben Affleck even better than Christian Bale as Batman. So just watch and enjoy, I know I did!"

"That's right. We have been waiting for these two heroes to finally meet and fight against each other. This movie is so good in both plot and special effects.Henry Cavill and Ben Affleck have performed well in their acting stages. They are the best superhero actors and they have filmed their fighting scenes very well. The movie starts to show the conflict between the lives of the heroes and now they have blamed each other for it. This movie is amazing and sets up a good plot for Dawn Justice."

"Actually...I didn't know what to expect. When you see Wonder Woman, you know it will be off of Wonder Woman and off of a Wonder Woman story, but with Batman V Superman, I was like, \"hmmmm, so who is this about?\" It was pretty obvious that it would feature many characters, but I thought the introduction to Batman was amazing. Ben Affleck nailed the part, not only as Batman but also as Bruce Wayne. He is my Batman. Henry Cavill continued to be super as the Man of Steel. And he is my Super - Man. A dark story? Yes, without a doubt. Could it have had a few more jokes? Sure. But not all movies or stories need to have jokes when certain events are serious. I really hope people can see this review and take another look at the movie, because, I loved it. I really hope the ratings can go up, eventually. And P.S, this movie is the perfect set up to Justice League."

"I'll start by making it clear I have only ever seen the Ultimate Edition. I'm aware of what was cut out for the theatrical release, so I will concede up front that most of the criticisms about pacing, editing, and missing bits of plot at release were merited.With that caveat out of the way, I must reiterate that this was bar-none the boldest superhero movie I have ever seen. To me, it was arguably the best as well, though \"best\" shouldn't be taken to mean \"most enjoyable.\" That honor easily goes to \"Thor: Ragnarok.\" What makes BvS stand out among other films in the genre is that it takes two characters who have been done to death since the 1970s and brings them up to date. I recently tried to watch \"Superman: The Movie\" for the first time in a number of years, and while it was still good and Reeves will always be iconic, I just couldn't take it seriously. I'll put it this way: If the story in BvS was \"stupid\" in your view but Superman turning back time by spinning the earth backward on its axis didn't seem like one of the dumbest things you have ever seen -in any movie from any genre- to the extent that it outright ruins the movie for you, then your opinion about BvS isn't worth much. Nostalgic bias was always going to be a problem for this movie, and the way people reacted to and reviewed \"Man of Steel\" was telling in this regard.That brings me to Zack Snyder's take on Superman. You know, that guy whose status as the first extraterrestrial ever encountered by humanity was a total non-issue in the old movies. Apparently, Snyder has a similar view to my own in that his take on the Man of Steel makes his being an alien a core piece of his identity. He may look like any other (absurdly attractive) person, but he knows what he is, and that makes him perpetually uncertain of where he fits in this world. He is essentially good and really does care about people, but he struggles to truly empathize with the likes of us. To be human is to be frail, and that is not something he can easily relate to. This is the root of his conflict with Batman.Just as Clark struggles to genuinely relate to most people, Snyder's Batman either refuses to or otherwise just can't relate to Superman. He doesn't see him as anything but a threat regardless of Superman's clear good intentions. Remember, a small group of Kryptonians were able to bring humanity to the brink of extinction in less than a day, and Bruce Wayne is nothing if not a realist. He didn't know the guy from Kansas. He only knew the god from another world.While Batman's anger toward and fear of Superman are readily apparent from the start, Superman's inability to imagine things from Bruce Wayne's perspective only becomes truly apparent during their first real interaction. This reminded me of the animated version of the \"world's finest\" storyline, where Superman judges Batman harshly for using fear tactics and threats of violence (also, actual violence) to get the job done. Superman wasn't willing to consider what it would take for a human man to fight criminals and save innocents, or what that life would do to him over time. Just as Batman didn't see the guy from Kansas, Superman didn't see the man who lives his life trapped in one brutal, unthinkably traumatic moment (this was beautifully conveyed during the film's opening moments), and had spent his whole adult life bearing witness to humanity at its absolute worst.The conflict between these two characters is as old as human history. They want the same things, but they can't understand one another. So they fight. And what a fight it was.Watching a fight between, say, Captain America and Iron Man was, to me, more frustrating than anything because each understood the other's perspective perfectly. The fight between Batman and Superman in BvS was genuinely gut-wrenching, as intended, because they would have understood one another if either had tried. The whole sequence hilighted Batman's tactical prowess and ability to control a situation. Maybe the most badass thing about the fight was that it ended exactly where Batman planned. That brings me to the big elephant in the room named \"Martha.\"I can't recall exactly which YouTuber put it this way, but if you thought the \"save Martha\" exchange was about their mothers having the same name, you had your brain turned off. The brain-on people have explained this to death, but it bears repeating. This was the moment when Superman became humanized to Batman. He was about to die, and his only concern was for his adoptive human mother. He still believed that the man about to take his life would do the right thing. Even with the cowl on, there was no mistaking the look on Batman's face. It was the look of shame, guilt, and sudden uncertainty that says \"What am I doing?\" Turns out even the most brutal, angry version of Bruce Wayne is better than Tony Stark at knowing right from wrong. At knowing that he had gone too far.From there, the third act was a series of truly impressive (albeit mostly CGI) fight sequences, beginning with what I regard as the undisputed champion of Batman fights. Nothing in the Nolan movies (and especially nothing in the Burton movies) even came close. Go ahead, try to convince yourself that Batman and Bane taking turns punching one another in the face until Bane's mask broke was a good fight sequence. No, this was a fight straight out of \"Arkham Knight,\" and it was glorious. The battle against Doomsday really was one for the books. From the moment Wonder Woman arrived accompanied by the intense sounds of Tina Guo's electric cello to Superman's tragic, heroic death at the hands of Doomsday, I was glued to the screen. Sure, the mere presence of Doomsday spoiled the end to a degree, but watching the Man of Steel laboring to carry that kryptonite spear towards certain death was no less impactful. A brief word on Jesse Eisenberg's take on Lex Luthor. At least one other reviewer on this site already said it best when they pointed out that this was his origin story. If you consider his scheme objectively, he is actually one of the more formidable incarnations of the character. If we're lucky, we'll eventually get to see a Snyder Cut of \"Justice League\" and find out where this story was actually meant to go. For the record, Joss Whedon and Danny Elfman both should have said \"no\" to taking a dump on someone else's art."
"BATMAN V SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE brings a fantastic surprise to a smash-hit team-up with one of the worlds most beloved DC Comics' icons of all time. The movie delivers spectacular casting, and fantastic acting with different characters having their shine in each scenes.The story follows Clark Kent/Superman who becomes a threat, after the destruction in Metropolis in Man Of Steel.(2013). Batman/Bruce Wayne sees him as a threat and begins his war on Superman.The movie brings spectacular storytelling, it tells the complications of human against alien who are on the same side, and the first meeting of Batman and Superman. The story of Bruce Wayne, with his many years of The Caped Crusader, sends him on a spiral of \"out of control\", sheer anger, and builds tension to wanting to defeat the Man of Steel. Snyder has fantastically gave this storytelling an exciting nod to the comics.Lex Luthor, played by Jesse Einsberg, delivers a very interesting performance, but very differently by him showing is his \"origin\" before he becomes a bald foe to the Man of Steel. He shows that his love of \"god vs man\" terrorises mankind when he ultimately creates Doomsday, and Batman realises Superman's inner heroism.It packs so many great \"out of nowhere\" excitement, including a first-look of the fearful Wonder Woman a.k.a. Diana Prince, played by Gal Gadot, and a fresh-new glimpse of the superhero DC canon: The Justice League.WATCH THIS MOVIE! The critics are out of their mind. It's a fun-packed action adventure which still keeps the movie enjoyable until it's final minutes of the movie. It's a FANTASTIC MOVIE! BEN AFFLECK AS BATMAN... is Incredible!A 10/10 overall!"
"I want to go on record as saying that this is a truly thrilling cinematic experience in so many ways. If pressed, I guess I could acknowledge that there were a couple ... let's say \"clumsy\" moments. And in a film that runs to three hours, that hardly seems like a significant issue, certainly not enough to rate it with fewer than 9 stars.This film has everything. There is dramatic tension right from the start. There is a magnificent story arc that picks up quite seamlessly from 'Man of Steel' and propels the viewer not only into the life of Clark Kent/Superman but also of Bruce Wayne/Batman.The villain is no mere cartoon of a villain; he is truly thoroughly (and apparently irrevocably) diabolical. He is a psychopath, and you wish for his death over and over and over. You want Superman to reduce him to ash with the power of his eyes.I have read a number of viewers' reviews, and it seems that the people who disliked the film / gave it a low rating had rather unfair and unrealistic expectations of it. That is, their own prejudices about how the plot could/should unfold or what the character development could/should be, etc. ruined the film for them. And that is a shame.My thought is: I settle into my seat, wait for the lights to dim, and then I wait to be transported by the film. I accept it, lock, stock, and barrel.As another reviewer remarked, I love how the film begins from the point of view of Bruce Wayne as he is among people on the ground who have fallen victim to the attack of Zod and the other Kryptonians.Why would Bruce Wayne not like Superman? Why would the good people of Earth hurl insults at Superman and burn him in effigy (on the news)? Because the good people of Earth just got catapulted into a new reality in which there are not only extraterrestrial beings (surprise!) but they are also superman! And a group of them are hell-bent on destroying humankind and taking the planet for themselves.It is difficult to see Superman as separate from the whole Kryptonian Krew.It seems that many moviegoers forgot that Bruce Wayne is also human. Sure, he's a hero, but he is flawed.. Just like the rest of us. He is a vigilante, after all.He has let his vigilantism get the better of him. HE is actually the one working outside the boundaries of the law, not Superman. It is the clear head of Alfred that shows us that he has gone into a rather dark place, that he has not seen what is really going on (in Luthor's scheme), and so he chooses to embark on his own scheme scheme to take out the alien invader. He is (allegedly) thinking of the future: if he wipes out the all-powerful alien, then it can't turn on humankind in the future. At least, he convinces himself of that.A philosophical question is raised in the film: should Clark Kent have remained a simple man from Kansas and never have become the Superman? Should he just let people die and let calamities happen? The question is answered for us in the character of Diana Prince/Wonder Woman. She withdrew from mankind (her exact words) and just sat around watching. Watching while people died horrible deaths all around her. So, should Superman have done the same? Do these special beings, these 'metahumans', have some kind of moral imperative to intervene, or should they be allowed to be regular people, too? It seems that humans want it both ways.It seems that humans are saying: \"Don't be a superalien ... except when I and my friends and family are in trouble. Then come save us.\""

"Batman v Superman: Ultimate Edition: If your looking for a quick, cheap thrill then you might not enjoy this film at the time. This movies theatrical version was butchered by WB and in doing so reshaped the story leaving numerous plot holes. So the Ultimate Edition is the full story and the one worth seeing. Watch 'Man of Steel' before seeing this movie. There is much to claw through here, so much so that the audience might easily find themselves exhausted from the overall aggression of the film. However, a lot of the story does work. The action is good, and the emotion feels real most of the time.This film is about Superman trying to become Superman. Trying to help the world, save people, find a place in this world not as an outcast, and yet is looked at has a threat by many. Superman is not from this world, yet He is trying to be human, find a place in this world, be excepted by earths people, and come into his destiny.This film is also about Batman being Batman for 20 years and losing faith in humanity, and fearing Superman, what Superman can do with his powers. Great film, great plot, great visuals. ---Yidioo"
"I didn't see the film in the theaters and just bought the \"Extended Edition \" on Amazon. I never properly saw Man of Steel- i think I rented it and watched it when already exhausted and fell asleep. I saw the mediocre user reviews and horrible reviews from critics of this film.They really have it wrong. This is the very best either Batman or Superman. It has a different take, on things. Much darker then earlier films even darker then the Christopher Nolan Batman films.First of all Christopher Nolan is an Executive Producer. So how bad could it be? I loved Sucker Punch and Zack Snyder was involved with that. So how bad could this be? Hans Zimmer did the music, so how bad could it be?I remember watching the old Superman TV shows and reading the Superman and Batman comics as a little kid and loved them, but i wouldn't call myself a \"fan boy\" of comic universes, like so many younger people today. As an older adult I will admit my favorite TV show of all time was Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but watched it on DVD only after it had finished. I saw the second of the Dark Knight series in the theater, but the other two, I watched on DVD. They were great, but not my favorite films like so many people. i also loved the first couple Superman and Batman films in the older series. Regardless, i was not waiting with baited breath to see Man of Steel or this one.I'm more of a serious film fan, who can watch Stanley Kubrick films over and over and my favorite films in the last twenty years, are Eyes Wide Shut and Intersteller, both of which i've watched multiple times.So, with that said, take it from me, the critics have this film very wrong, just as critics hated 2001: A Space Odyssey when it first came out. This film will have lasting appreciation.Surprised how much I liked Ben Afleck's Batman. it was hard to get into Henry Cavil's scrawnier looking Superman, but it grew on me. Amy Adams was great as Lois Lane, The Gal Gadol Wonder Women was amazing. Lex Luther was terrific, like Nolan's Joker. Jeremy Irons was the best Alfred ever. Holly Hunter and Diane Lane was good too. The movie had bad reviews but made a billion dollars. Hopefully everyone buys the Ultimate Edition and it breaks sales records and the film is re-appreciated. I have no idea what scenes this Ultimate Edition added, but it is pretty perfect. Now I can't wait for Wonder Woman and the Justice League and as soon as I finish writing this am going to watch Man of Steal. I'm into it now!I can only surmise that the bad reviews stem from too much expectations of the rigid fan boy types and the radical changes in tone, we see in this film.Total masterpiece of cinema, but I have a few criticisms. There are a few hollow scenes of typical Idiot cops and authorities getting everything wrong in a cliché type way and it has a few filler scenes of that type and a few moments here and there that felt rushed and cheesy. Maybe not everything restored into the Ultimate Edition should have been. I wish there had been more Kevin Costner scenes."

"The whole entire Batman V Superman movie was great and yes even though it felt slow to the majority of the people who watched it but to me I enjoyed every part and every scene of Batman V Superman and when it got to the fight scenes both batman VS Superman and the Doomsday fight it brought so much drama, intensity, and epic performances. So with that being said I give this movie a good 10/10 because it really did go to my expectations and it brought a powerful performance and a powerful yet epic introduction to the upcoming Justice League."

"When I first wrote a review for this movie a year ago exclaiming my excitement for the film, I had been high off a fresh dose of live-action DC superheroes playing out the beloved comic book stories that I had grown up on. It was all playing out before my eyes and coming to life. After a few months had passed, I began to notice things about the movie that I disliked: little gaps in the story, things that didn't add up, etc. My original rating of a 10 / 10 dropped to an 8 /10. But today it has gone back up to a 10. The extended version of the film not only rectifies the gaps but also silences critics.Many claimed that the movie was too dark or that it just didn't make sense. To those people, I say: \"Pick up a comic book!\" Many of the critics of this particular film were part of the superhero bandwagon that formed when Marvel began its spree of Avengers-related films. In fact, its estimated that over 60% of people who go to see 'superhero' genre films have never picked up a comic book in their life. I would argue that similar numbers could figure to those which view the CW televised DC Universe shows. People complain that DC comics is just too dark but the fact is that these movies are based upon actual comics which are meant to be dark (ex: The Dark Knight Returns, Injustice, etc.). Its like complaining that Game of Thrones (the TV series) sucks because they kill off too many characters. Read the books! Its frustrating to see such a beautiful work of art like Batman V Superman criticized by those ignorant to its universe and its meaning. This movie is in fact a catalyst that opens numerous doorways and leaves true fans in awe of the possibilities for future movies. But regardless of whether or not people choose to educate themselves, this film's DVD/Blu-ray extended version puts the theater release to shame. All of the plot holes and gaps are filled in 30 minutes of extended footage scattered throughout the film. The movie ultimately becomes more complete and people will wish that the movie had shown the full 3 hours of footage in its theatrical debut. As a major DC comics fan, I will of course pick up on things that a comics fan would not, but someone who does not read comics would learn to appreciate this film in its entirety with the extended version. Get your hands on a copy today or find it on Netflix or the internet somewhere!"

"I ignored the bad reviews and watched anyways. This film had a lot to live up to after Civil War was released and I went into this film expecting the worst. It ended up to be the best Superhero film of 2016 to me. One complaint was that this film was more concerned about universe building than telling a great story than Civil War but for me it was the other way around; Civil War felt like a build up to something else and to be honest, I felt that way when I saw the other MCU films. Batman vs Superman however not only had a great story, but it also felt a lot more consistent than Civil War. This film was way more diverse with the cast than the MCU but unlike the MCU, I felt like this film doesn't go overboard with the SJW stuff like the MCU films or The Star Wars Sequel films do. The Visuals were AMAZING, The Score by Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL was AMAZING as well, The Tone is just right as I actually felt for the characters emotionally, The Cinematography kept my eyes glued to the screen, and the script felt really Intelligent and Complex and despite people calling the writing confusing, I was able to piece it together with no problem whatsoever. This film is similar to Empire Strikes back in terms of popularity so over time after the other movies are released, this movie would probably be more popular.This film was way better than I Expected and deserves another chance.

"Its shame to see what critics and marvel fans did to this movie and targeted Zack Snyder for it. I have seen this movie more than 25 times till date. And i enjoy this movie as much as i enjoyed the first time. The fans who have read DC comics, wouldn't be disappointed in this movie. Its dark movie, yes it is. Because the title shows the intense situation at hand. Two superheroes about to rip each other apart for whatever reasons that brought them to this stage. Yes it had to be dark and intense.Only marvel can be stupid enough to show an alien invasion where humans are loosing the battle and the super heroes are cracking jokes while battles as if they are playing ping pong. a person playing Call of Duty game is more serious while playing than the marvel heroes fighting aliens."

"Last week some news came out from somebody online who had claimed to have seen a finished version of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. If you were like me, you've been leery of checking it out because you weren't sure how much might actually be true. Now Zack Snyder has spoken out about the spoiler-filled post, although his response doesn't really clear anything up.In a word, to MTV, he called the post \"hilarious,which might imply that he's saying that it's mostly, if not entirely, untrue. That might be the case, but then again he could have just said it was untrue and he didn't say that. What he did say, however, is that he doesn't like spoilers. While this may seem odd for the director who's most recent trailer appeared to give away the entire movie, Snyder says that's not the case. Even if you've seen the trailer, you can rest easy, as there is much more we have not seen in then finished film. Says Snyder I have the benefit of seeing the movie. It's cool that think it's too much, and I appreciate people not wanting to know, but there's plenty that they don't know. There's a lot of movie that's not in the trailer. In the process of calling the Batman v Superman Reddit review hilarious, Snyder goes on to talk about how he hates it when spoilers come out. The director would much rather that fans see the movie mostly blind. While he understands that some fans may wish to find the answers before hand, he wants his movies to be mysteries going in. If you're, as an audience member, exploring these articles, looking for answers to questions that you have, maybe you're okay with knowing before you go. It's like an individual taste. But like I said, I want people to see the movie without knowing.Spoilers are a topic that mean different things to different people. While most try to avoid them to some degree, the need to solve the mystery is a nearly universal human experience. We have an inclination to want to know the truth, even while also wanting to be surprised. For most of us getting some information is good, but getting all the information is bad, of course, only getting the details that you want can be difficult."
"The theatrical is choppy, poorly edited, hard to follow, with some really good moments mixed in their. The extended is much more fluent and is much easier to follow, it does have a long runtime, which might make it seem a bit dragging on, but if you like long films done right, like Lord of the Rings, you will like this movie as long as you get into the characters and story. Speaking of which, the story starts out perfectly showing Bruce Wayne as a character, and it is very powerful. There are several moments in this movie that are powerful, emotional, and shocking. Characters. Batman is my favorite fictional character of all time, and believe me when I say, Ben Affleck as Batman was perfect, he had the charisma, the anger, and the look of being through some bad stuff Gal Gadot also does perfect as Wonder Woman, but if you want to really see how good she does, go watch the Wonder Woman movie. Henry Call as Superman. I really don't like it when people say Christopher Reeves is better. Don't get me wrong, Reeves does great, but can you imagine him as Superman in this movie? I wouldn't like it. It would be like Adam West playing Batman in The Dark Knight. Henry Cavill does great in this role, I can say everything about him as I said with Ben Affleck. Jesse Eisenberg as Luthor. I thought it was different in a good way. I've heard a criticism for him as being too much like Joker, but is that a bad thing? Joker is my favorite villain, so to see Superman have an enemy that crazy, but still hold the values Luthor needs to be Luthor, I think it is great. The thing I thought this movie was lacking in the first and second acts was humor, at least good humor. If there was more humor, I would've given this movie a ten because it would give a more relaxing feel to the parts that needed it. All in all though, this movie was awesome, it had powerful moments, it was badass, and just plain fun. It had a great story arc and does its job very well."

"*I will be talking about the Ultimate Edition of the film* This was one of the most anticipated CBM of all time. Ever since the arrival and subsequent success of Marvel's The Avengers people have wondered when will DC launch its own cinematic universe, one of the main reasons being the opportunity to finally see titans such as Batman and Superman share the screen together: the ultimate nerd dream. On 2016, the moment finally came for BvS to be released AND.. it performed poorly. Not only did critical reception left a lot to be desired, but fan reactions where surprisingly split after its cinematic debut. People either loved it and called Zack a genius, or hated it and called him a hack. Me, personally, I found myself with middle of the road feelings, for sure, but more leaning towards the negative side with subsequent viewings. The theatrical cut of the film showcased amazing performances, incredible visuals, and action set pieces that seemed like comic book panels come to life, in a good way. However, when it comes to its narrative structure and more technical aspects like editing, the film was seriously flawed. More plot holes than Age of Ultron, questionable character decisions, random editing that lacked cohesion and focus, and forced dramatic moments that lacked any impact because the attempts at character development ranged from limited to nonexistent, especially when it comes to Superman's character. I thought it was a 5/10 movie at best. As such, I was kind of skeptical about the idea of a 30 minute longer version. I say kind of because I know how Zack works. I remember Watchmen being vastly improved with its director's cut, so in a way I was expecting BvS to perform in a similar manner, but I also feared those 30 minutes wold be just there to amplify action and discredit storytelling issues. Oh boy, I'm so glad I was proved wrong. The ultimate cut of the film was infuriating, but not because it was awful, but because it questions the sanity of WB executives and editors and makes you wonder what were they thinking during the editing process. What I got out of the Ultimate Edition was a thought-provoking deconstruction of two very iconic superheroes that gave spotlight to the struggles both of them face when they aren't fighting crime. What I got was an extremely well produced character study on both Batman and Superman in a cynical world, a world dangerously close to our own. We meet Batman as a ruthless, worn out hero that has seen the failure behind his ideals and witnessed some truly horrifying things in his life. Superman, on the other hand, is portrayed as a godlike figure that seeks to do good in the world, but finds himself emotionally conflicted once he realized that every good deed he does leaves behind a trail of destruction (most of it due to Luthor's antics). In my opinion, this is a hugely original approach, one that distances itself from the rest of the competition and delivers a dark, somber, yet relevant superhero movie that understands both characters and gives them real human struggles to deal with. I felt invested in both of them, and hoped that by the end of the film both could find a way to redeem themselves. Their character arcs were very well established during the first two acts of the movie, and by the time we get to the titular climactic battle the emotion behind the jaw-dropping action is intensified. Lex Luthor as a villain was also given more time to develop with this new edition. One of the main criticisms with the original version was the fact that his plan relied too much on conveniences, and the character's mannerisms and mad-scientist attitude was annoying, and that goes without saying his motivations were unclear. Not only do we spend more time understanding his hate for any godlike figure and thus his hatred for Superman, but the added scenes allowed us to witness his entire plan come to fruition. It sells the cold, manipulative, calculating attributes of his comic counterpart. The acting is spot on. Every actor owns his/her role, from Cavill's Superman, to Ben Affleck as Batman, Eisenberg as Luthor, and Gadot as Wonder Woman, whose scenes are brief, but are more than enough to sell the strong and ferocious warrior that she is. Cinematography is stunning, and miles above that of Man of Steel's. And the soundtrack by Zimmer and Junkie XL? Perfect, just perfect. When it comes to flaws, the film still has some of those. The Martha moment, while serving as a pivotal character moment for Batman, felt off in execution, and its understandable that many people got mad at it. If your main complaint about BvS the first time around was its bleak tone and subject matter, this film is still not for you. I understand most were expecting to see the heroes being the most iconic versions of themselves, clashing in an elongated battle and evoking the same feelings The Avengers gave audiences back in 2012. In that sense, the film will remain divisive, but at least I have the comfort of saying that, at the very least, the film is competently made."

"This film was amazing. Ben Affleck was easily the best part of this movie, he brought his a-game as Batman. The chemistry between Affleck & Irons was outstanding. Gal Gadot did a great job as Wonder Woman. The fight between Batman & Superman was awesome. The final fight with Doomsday was outstanding in every way possible. However, there is only one problem with this film and that's Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor. He was sadly missed cast in this role, but then again it's really the fault of Warner Bros. Studios. Overall, this film deliver on almost every level. I highly recommend that you watch the extended version of this film."

"I know I know. I saw it in theaters too, and felt like it could've been so much better. While the Batman element was good, the narrative felt fractured, and the third act was just one long stunt scene. Superman was relegated to a supporting character, and other characters didn't get a chance to shine. And then I chanced on the ultimate cut. Calling it 30 mins of \"extra\" footage is unfair to Zack Snyder because it's exactly these 30 mins that makes the movie a worthy one. What I can say about the theatrical cut is this - It had the blockbuster elements - music, visuals, stunts, CGI. But, it lacked the human elements. The first 20 mins of the movie had it, but not after that. The extended cut in comparison has a flow to the narrative. There are no disjointed scenes, everything flows smoothly, and there's connective tissue. Superman gets to spend some time with his father, and mother. Clark Kent does some investigative journalism. Superman helps the people after the blast. Lois Lane doesn't jump to conclusions, she gets to the bottom of the crime. Lex Luthor apparently had a coherent plan - everything is explained pretty well. Wonder Woman was already good, so there's no change there :) Also, the \"Martha\" scene seems better executed, because it is a few seconds longer, and there's time to breathe it in. So, here's my take on this movie - The theatrical cut was junk. Get the Bluray for ultimate edition, and you shall not be disappointed. I've seen it so many more times now, and it's the definitive cut. It is the movie we deserve. It's a unique take on Batman, and Superman. It's a gritty take on the superhero movie genre, and definitely the best DCEU movie, and the best DC movie since The Dark Knight.P.S. Yes it's dark. We're adults, and we should appreciate mature film making without intentionally silly moments. It attempts to be philosophical, and something deep instead of just trying to make you chuckle."

"This is one of the best superhero movies ever made. Zack Snyder is a magician behind the camera.The reason behind so many complaints is the fact that Warner Bros. marketed this movie as a fight between Batman and Superman. That's not what it is. It's a movie about the origins of the Justice League.The cinematography, the acting and the score are all second to none. This film is phenomenal.P.S: watch the 3 hour extended cut that Snyder intended you to see, not the 2 and a half hour movie that Warner Bros. decided would be better for theaters."

"I don't care what the critics say, this is a very well-done movie. I'll start my review by listing what I like about the movie.1.) Ben Affleck is the best batman to me and it is not close. He pulls off the role of an aging batman extremely well. Also, Zack Snyder's vision of batman is legit. I have always hated batman up until this adaptation of him. Instead of being a conflicted and idealistic batman, this batman is dark, gritty, and 100% a badass. His equipment is decked out with machine guns and he has no aversion to killing people. In fact, he probably kills about 50 criminal by the time this movie is over. The warehouse scene is the coolest batman scene in any movie.2.) The development of a grudge between batman and superman is pulled off flawlessly. It actually makes sense why batman dislikes superman. Then, when they do fight it is about the coolest thing you can expect to see from a superhero film. 3.) I disagree with a lot of people about Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor. In my opinion, he played his role to perfection. 4.) B v S sets up Wonder Woman and Justice League with Gal Gadot's cameo as Wonder Woman and short clips of Aquaman, the Flash, and Cyborg. B v S is one of my favorite superhero films and rewatching it never gets old."

"The theatrical cut of this film is garbage which is why I rated it eight stars instead of nine. The first time I watched this film I didn't like it (not straight out hate but didn't like). Character motivations didn't make any sense, Lex was annoying as s***, editing was sloppy, and it was overly dark and broody for an action superhero movie. A year + a half, five Marvel films, a ton of bad reviews and a Justice League later a thought popped into my head: \"what if I watched BVS again\". This time I didn't have trailers ruining the best moments, I only vaguely remembered the film, and I was conditioned to look at it negatively but something unexpected happened: I actually loved it. Superman was just a normal person that tried to make a difference cause he could that others imposed their own beliefs on. Lex Luthor was a genius that couldn't stand his powerlessness compared to Superman or more accurately a super being. As Alfred said \"The fever, the rage, the feeling of powerlessness that turns good men... cruel\" and you see the same thought process in Batman. Batman, just like Lex Luthor feels powerless in the midst of a god-being and just like Lex he attempts to destroy him so he can get his sense of power back but unlike Lex, Batman learns something. I what is one of the corniest lines of the movie Superman says, \"Martha\" when he knows he can't win against Batman in a late desperate attempt to save his mother. Not only does this name connect with Bruce Wayne but it also shows what really matters to a man of steel: it isn't power, it isn't fame or anything else, it is his Mother and on a broader scale it is people. Lex (who doesn't care about people at all) knows he doesn't have the power so he creates something from his blood and the remains of Zod: A Doomsday for Superman. Not only does this film have depth but it also doesn't always explain it to you which is rare in a blockbuster action superhero flick normally cater to semi-comic book fans and people that want to shove popcorn in their mouths. This film rewards you for really noticing the details while still having massive explosions. One of my favorites is how Lex has all of Batman's branded killed which is why he isn't afraid of the branding at the end or Grandma's Peach Tea as a way of scaring the s*** out of someone. Of course, this film isn't perfect and I do have personal dislikes. The Batman V Superman fight was slow and pretty boring especially after watching such an amazing fight in Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 2 (If you haven't watched the animated Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 1 and 2 you are sorely missing out on something fantastic). Also, the addition of Wonder Woman who pretty much steals a hacker thing, gives it back and then suits up and fights against a giant monster thing. Not to say I don't like Wonder Woman (She is one of my favorite Superheroes of all time who showed not only can woman kick a** but they also don't need to be ashamed of their sexuality or gender) but she wasn't really that helpful to the plot and just brought in to expand the universe which was well done through Lex's superhuman hunting files. Also, the post-apocalyptic scene that was just a dream could have been cut but nothing is perfect except movies like Citizen Kane which isn't a lot of fun to watch cause it is too perfect. So to summarize, the theatrical cut is bad, the ultimate cut is Amazing and the other cut is meh. Please give it a second chance because it deserves it and save a good director from losing grace because of something he didn't do."
"I really liked it, don't know what all the hate is about. I'm actually a Marvel fan from when I was 7 or so, but Superman and Batman together in 1 movie? Just great. And personally I like Ben Affleck even better than Christian Bale as Batman. So just watch and enjoy, I know I did!"

"That's right. We have been waiting for these two heroes to finally meet and fight against each other. This movie is so good in both plot and special effects.Henry Cavill and Ben Affleck have performed well in their acting stages. They are the best superhero actors and they have filmed their fighting scenes very well. The movie starts to show the conflict between the lives of the heroes and now they have blamed each other for it. This movie is amazing and sets up a good plot for Dawn Justice."

"Actually...I didn't know what to expect. When you see Wonder Woman, you know it will be off of Wonder Woman and off of a Wonder Woman story, but with Batman V Superman, I was like, \"hmmmm, so who is this about?\" It was pretty obvious that it would feature many characters, but I thought the introduction to Batman was amazing. Ben Affleck nailed the part, not only as Batman but also as Bruce Wayne. He is my Batman. Henry Cavill continued to be super as the Man of Steel. And he is my Super - Man. A dark story? Yes, without a doubt. Could it have had a few more jokes? Sure. But not all movies or stories need to have jokes when certain events are serious. I really hope people can see this review and take another look at the movie, because, I loved it. I really hope the ratings can go up, eventually. And P.S, this movie is the perfect set up to Justice League."

"I'll start by making it clear I have only ever seen the Ultimate Edition. I'm aware of what was cut out for the theatrical release, so I will concede up front that most of the criticisms about pacing, editing, and missing bits of plot at release were merited.With that caveat out of the way, I must reiterate that this was bar-none the boldest superhero movie I have ever seen. To me, it was arguably the best as well, though \"best\" shouldn't be taken to mean \"most enjoyable.\" That honor easily goes to \"Thor: Ragnarok.\" What makes BvS stand out among other films in the genre is that it takes two characters who have been done to death since the 1970s and brings them up to date. I recently tried to watch \"Superman: The Movie\" for the first time in a number of years, and while it was still good and Reeves will always be iconic, I just couldn't take it seriously. I'll put it this way: If the story in BvS was \"stupid\" in your view but Superman turning back time by spinning the earth backward on its axis didn't seem like one of the dumbest things you have ever seen -in any movie from any genre- to the extent that it outright ruins the movie for you, then your opinion about BvS isn't worth much. Nostalgic bias was always going to be a problem for this movie, and the way people reacted to and reviewed \"Man of Steel\" was telling in this regard.That brings me to Zack Snyder's take on Superman. You know, that guy whose status as the first extraterrestrial ever encountered by humanity was a total non-issue in the old movies. Apparently, Snyder has a similar view to my own in that his take on the Man of Steel makes his being an alien a core piece of his identity. He may look like any other (absurdly attractive) person, but he knows what he is, and that makes him perpetually uncertain of where he fits in this world. He is essentially good and really does care about people, but he struggles to truly empathize with the likes of us. To be human is to be frail, and that is not something he can easily relate to. This is the root of his conflict with Batman.Just as Clark struggles to genuinely relate to most people, Snyder's Batman either refuses to or otherwise just can't relate to Superman. He doesn't see him as anything but a threat regardless of Superman's clear good intentions. Remember, a small group of Kryptonians were able to bring humanity to the brink of extinction in less than a day, and Bruce Wayne is nothing if not a realist. He didn't know the guy from Kansas. He only knew the god from another world.While Batman's anger toward and fear of Superman are readily apparent from the start, Superman's inability to imagine things from Bruce Wayne's perspective only becomes truly apparent during their first real interaction. This reminded me of the animated version of the \"world's finest\" storyline, where Superman judges Batman harshly for using fear tactics and threats of violence (also, actual violence) to get the job done. Superman wasn't willing to consider what it would take for a human man to fight criminals and save innocents, or what that life would do to him over time. Just as Batman didn't see the guy from Kansas, Superman didn't see the man who lives his life trapped in one brutal, unthinkably traumatic moment (this was beautifully conveyed during the film's opening moments), and had spent his whole adult life bearing witness to humanity at its absolute worst.The conflict between these two characters is as old as human history. They want the same things, but they can't understand one another. So they fight. And what a fight it was.Watching a fight between, say, Captain America and Iron Man was, to me, more frustrating than anything because each understood the other's perspective perfectly. The fight between Batman and Superman in BvS was genuinely gut-wrenching, as intended, because they would have understood one another if either had tried. The whole sequence hilighted Batman's tactical prowess and ability to control a situation. Maybe the most badass thing about the fight was that it ended exactly where Batman planned. That brings me to the big elephant in the room named \"Martha.\"I can't recall exactly which YouTuber put it this way, but if you thought the \"save Martha\" exchange was about their mothers having the same name, you had your brain turned off. The brain-on people have explained this to death, but it bears repeating. This was the moment when Superman became humanized to Batman. He was about to die, and his only concern was for his adoptive human mother. He still believed that the man about to take his life would do the right thing. Even with the cowl on, there was no mistaking the look on Batman's face. It was the look of shame, guilt, and sudden uncertainty that says \"What am I doing?\" Turns out even the most brutal, angry version of Bruce Wayne is better than Tony Stark at knowing right from wrong. At knowing that he had gone too far.From there, the third act was a series of truly impressive (albeit mostly CGI) fight sequences, beginning with what I regard as the undisputed champion of Batman fights. Nothing in the Nolan movies (and especially nothing in the Burton movies) even came close. Go ahead, try to convince yourself that Batman and Bane taking turns punching one another in the face until Bane's mask broke was a good fight sequence. No, this was a fight straight out of \"Arkham Knight,\" and it was glorious. The battle against Doomsday really was one for the books. From the moment Wonder Woman arrived accompanied by the intense sounds of Tina Guo's electric cello to Superman's tragic, heroic death at the hands of Doomsday, I was glued to the screen. Sure, the mere presence of Doomsday spoiled the end to a degree, but watching the Man of Steel laboring to carry that kryptonite spear towards certain death was no less impactful. A brief word on Jesse Eisenberg's take on Lex Luthor. At least one other reviewer on this site already said it best when they pointed out that this was his origin story. If you consider his scheme objectively, he is actually one of the more formidable incarnations of the character. If we're lucky, we'll eventually get to see a Snyder Cut of \"Justice League\" and find out where this story was actually meant to go. For the record, Joss Whedon and Danny Elfman both should have said \"no\" to taking a dump on someone else's art."
"BATMAN V SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE brings a fantastic surprise to a smash-hit team-up with one of the worlds most beloved DC Comics' icons of all time. The movie delivers spectacular casting, and fantastic acting with different characters having their shine in each scenes.The story follows Clark Kent/Superman who becomes a threat, after the destruction in Metropolis in Man Of Steel.(2013). Batman/Bruce Wayne sees him as a threat and begins his war on Superman.The movie brings spectacular storytelling, it tells the complications of human against alien who are on the same side, and the first meeting of Batman and Superman. The story of Bruce Wayne, with his many years of The Caped Crusader, sends him on a spiral of \"out of control\", sheer anger, and builds tension to wanting to defeat the Man of Steel. Snyder has fantastically gave this storytelling an exciting nod to the comics.Lex Luthor, played by Jesse Einsberg, delivers a very interesting performance, but very differently by him showing is his \"origin\" before he becomes a bald foe to the Man of Steel. He shows that his love of \"god vs man\" terrorises mankind when he ultimately creates Doomsday, and Batman realises Superman's inner heroism.It packs so many great \"out of nowhere\" excitement, including a first-look of the fearful Wonder Woman a.k.a. Diana Prince, played by Gal Gadot, and a fresh-new glimpse of the superhero DC canon: The Justice League.WATCH THIS MOVIE! The critics are out of their mind. It's a fun-packed action adventure which still keeps the movie enjoyable until it's final minutes of the movie. It's a FANTASTIC MOVIE! BEN AFFLECK AS BATMAN... is Incredible!A 10/10 overall!"
"I want to go on record as saying that this is a truly thrilling cinematic experience in so many ways. If pressed, I guess I could acknowledge that there were a couple ... let's say \"clumsy\" moments. And in a film that runs to three hours, that hardly seems like a significant issue, certainly not enough to rate it with fewer than 9 stars.This film has everything. There is dramatic tension right from the start. There is a magnificent story arc that picks up quite seamlessly from 'Man of Steel' and propels the viewer not only into the life of Clark Kent/Superman but also of Bruce Wayne/Batman.The villain is no mere cartoon of a villain; he is truly thoroughly (and apparently irrevocably) diabolical. He is a psychopath, and you wish for his death over and over and over. You want Superman to reduce him to ash with the power of his eyes.I have read a number of viewers' reviews, and it seems that the people who disliked the film / gave it a low rating had rather unfair and unrealistic expectations of it. That is, their own prejudices about how the plot could/should unfold or what the character development could/should be, etc. ruined the film for them. And that is a shame.My thought is: I settle into my seat, wait for the lights to dim, and then I wait to be transported by the film. I accept it, lock, stock, and barrel.As another reviewer remarked, I love how the film begins from the point of view of Bruce Wayne as he is among people on the ground who have fallen victim to the attack of Zod and the other Kryptonians.Why would Bruce Wayne not like Superman? Why would the good people of Earth hurl insults at Superman and burn him in effigy (on the news)? Because the good people of Earth just got catapulted into a new reality in which there are not only extraterrestrial beings (surprise!) but they are also superman! And a group of them are hell-bent on destroying humankind and taking the planet for themselves.It is difficult to see Superman as separate from the whole Kryptonian Krew.It seems that many moviegoers forgot that Bruce Wayne is also human. Sure, he's a hero, but he is flawed.. Just like the rest of us. He is a vigilante, after all.He has let his vigilantism get the better of him. HE is actually the one working outside the boundaries of the law, not Superman. It is the clear head of Alfred that shows us that he has gone into a rather dark place, that he has not seen what is really going on (in Luthor's scheme), and so he chooses to embark on his own scheme scheme to take out the alien invader. He is (allegedly) thinking of the future: if he wipes out the all-powerful alien, then it can't turn on humankind in the future. At least, he convinces himself of that.A philosophical question is raised in the film: should Clark Kent have remained a simple man from Kansas and never have become the Superman? Should he just let people die and let calamities happen? The question is answered for us in the character of Diana Prince/Wonder Woman. She withdrew from mankind (her exact words) and just sat around watching. Watching while people died horrible deaths all around her. So, should Superman have done the same? Do these special beings, these 'metahumans', have some kind of moral imperative to intervene, or should they be allowed to be regular people, too? It seems that humans want it both ways.It seems that humans are saying: \"Don't be a superalien ... except when I and my friends and family are in trouble. Then come save us.\""

"Batman v Superman: Ultimate Edition: If your looking for a quick, cheap thrill then you might not enjoy this film at the time. This movies theatrical version was butchered by WB and in doing so reshaped the story leaving numerous plot holes. So the Ultimate Edition is the full story and the one worth seeing. Watch 'Man of Steel' before seeing this movie. There is much to claw through here, so much so that the audience might easily find themselves exhausted from the overall aggression of the film. However, a lot of the story does work. The action is good, and the emotion feels real most of the time.This film is about Superman trying to become Superman. Trying to help the world, save people, find a place in this world not as an outcast, and yet is looked at has a threat by many. Superman is not from this world, yet He is trying to be human, find a place in this world, be excepted by earths people, and come into his destiny.This film is also about Batman being Batman for 20 years and losing faith in humanity, and fearing Superman, what Superman can do with his powers. Great film, great plot, great visuals. ---Yidioo"
"I didn't see the film in the theaters and just bought the \"Extended Edition \" on Amazon. I never properly saw Man of Steel- i think I rented it and watched it when already exhausted and fell asleep. I saw the mediocre user reviews and horrible reviews from critics of this film.They really have it wrong. This is the very best either Batman or Superman. It has a different take, on things. Much darker then earlier films even darker then the Christopher Nolan Batman films.First of all Christopher Nolan is an Executive Producer. So how bad could it be? I loved Sucker Punch and Zack Snyder was involved with that. So how bad could this be? Hans Zimmer did the music, so how bad could it be?I remember watching the old Superman TV shows and reading the Superman and Batman comics as a little kid and loved them, but i wouldn't call myself a \"fan boy\" of comic universes, like so many younger people today. As an older adult I will admit my favorite TV show of all time was Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but watched it on DVD only after it had finished. I saw the second of the Dark Knight series in the theater, but the other two, I watched on DVD. They were great, but not my favorite films like so many people. i also loved the first couple Superman and Batman films in the older series. Regardless, i was not waiting with baited breath to see Man of Steel or this one.I'm more of a serious film fan, who can watch Stanley Kubrick films over and over and my favorite films in the last twenty years, are Eyes Wide Shut and Intersteller, both of which i've watched multiple times.So, with that said, take it from me, the critics have this film very wrong, just as critics hated 2001: A Space Odyssey when it first came out. This film will have lasting appreciation.Surprised how much I liked Ben Afleck's Batman. it was hard to get into Henry Cavil's scrawnier looking Superman, but it grew on me. Amy Adams was great as Lois Lane, The Gal Gadol Wonder Women was amazing. Lex Luther was terrific, like Nolan's Joker. Jeremy Irons was the best Alfred ever. Holly Hunter and Diane Lane was good too. The movie had bad reviews but made a billion dollars. Hopefully everyone buys the Ultimate Edition and it breaks sales records and the film is re-appreciated. I have no idea what scenes this Ultimate Edition added, but it is pretty perfect. Now I can't wait for Wonder Woman and the Justice League and as soon as I finish writing this am going to watch Man of Steal. I'm into it now!I can only surmise that the bad reviews stem from too much expectations of the rigid fan boy types and the radical changes in tone, we see in this film.Total masterpiece of cinema, but I have a few criticisms. There are a few hollow scenes of typical Idiot cops and authorities getting everything wrong in a cliché type way and it has a few filler scenes of that type and a few moments here and there that felt rushed and cheesy. Maybe not everything restored into the Ultimate Edition should have been. I wish there had been more Kevin Costner scenes."

"The whole entire Batman V Superman movie was great and yes even though it felt slow to the majority of the people who watched it but to me I enjoyed every part and every scene of Batman V Superman and when it got to the fight scenes both batman VS Superman and the Doomsday fight it brought so much drama, intensity, and epic performances. So with that being said I give this movie a good 10/10 because it really did go to my expectations and it brought a powerful performance and a powerful yet epic introduction to the upcoming Justice League."

"Zack Snyder not only understands the characters but he also understands how to craft a real amazing movie for fans - honestly blew me away (extended cut) Brilliant!Don't believe what the internet is telling you to think - take this from a person who has worked in the comic book industry - this is amazing!"

"When I first wrote a review for this movie a year ago exclaiming my excitement for the film, I had been high off a fresh dose of live-action DC superheroes playing out the beloved comic book stories that I had grown up on. It was all playing out before my eyes and coming to life. After a few months had passed, I began to notice things about the movie that I disliked: little gaps in the story, things that didn't add up, etc. My original rating of a 10 / 10 dropped to an 8 /10. But today it has gone back up to a 10. The extended version of the film not only rectifies the gaps but also silences critics.Many claimed that the movie was too dark or that it just didn't make sense. To those people, I say: \"Pick up a comic book!\" Many of the critics of this particular film were part of the superhero bandwagon that formed when Marvel began its spree of Avengers-related films. In fact, its estimated that over 60% of people who go to see 'superhero' genre films have never picked up a comic book in their life. I would argue that similar numbers could figure to those which view the CW televised DC Universe shows. People complain that DC comics is just too dark but the fact is that these movies are based upon actual comics which are meant to be dark (ex: The Dark Knight Returns, Injustice, etc.). Its like complaining that Game of Thrones (the TV series) sucks because they kill off too many characters. Read the books! Its frustrating to see such a beautiful work of art like Batman V Superman criticized by those ignorant to its universe and its meaning. This movie is in fact a catalyst that opens numerous doorways and leaves true fans in awe of the possibilities for future movies. But regardless of whether or not people choose to educate themselves, this film's DVD/Blu-ray extended version puts the theater release to shame. All of the plot holes and gaps are filled in 30 minutes of extended footage scattered throughout the film. The movie ultimately becomes more complete and people will wish that the movie had shown the full 3 hours of footage in its theatrical debut. As a major DC comics fan, I will of course pick up on things that a comics fan would not, but someone who does not read comics would learn to appreciate this film in its entirety with the extended version. Get your hands on a copy today or find it on Netflix or the internet somewhere!"

"I ignored the bad reviews and watched anyways. This film had a lot to live up to after Civil War was released and I went into this film expecting the worst. It ended up to be the best Superhero film of 2016 to me. One complaint was that this film was more concerned about universe building than telling a great story than Civil War but for me it was the other way around; Civil War felt like a build up to something else and to be honest, I felt that way when I saw the other MCU films. Batman vs Superman however not only had a great story, but it also felt a lot more consistent than Civil War. This film was way more diverse with the cast than the MCU but unlike the MCU, I felt like this film doesn't go overboard with the SJW stuff like the MCU films or The Star Wars Sequel films do. The Visuals were AMAZING, The Score by Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL was AMAZING as well, The Tone is just right as I actually felt for the characters emotionally, The Cinematography kept my eyes glued to the screen, and the script felt really Intelligent and Complex and despite people calling the writing confusing, I was able to piece it together with no problem whatsoever. This film is similar to Empire Strikes back in terms of popularity so over time after the other movies are released, this movie would probably be more popular.This film was way better than I Expected and deserves another chance.

"Its shame to see what critics and marvel fans did to this movie and targeted Zack Snyder for it. I have seen this movie more than 25 times till date. And i enjoy this movie as much as i enjoyed the first time. The fans who have read DC comics, wouldn't be disappointed in this movie. Its dark movie, yes it is. Because the title shows the intense situation at hand. Two superheroes about to rip each other apart for whatever reasons that brought them to this stage. Yes it had to be dark and intense.Only marvel can be stupid enough to show an alien invasion where humans are loosing the battle and the super heroes are cracking jokes while battles as if they are playing ping pong. a person playing Call of Duty game is more serious while playing than the marvel heroes fighting aliens."

"Last week some news came out from somebody online who had claimed to have seen a finished version of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. If you were like me, you've been leery of checking it out because you weren't sure how much might actually be true. Now Zack Snyder has spoken out about the spoiler-filled post, although his response doesn't really clear anything up.In a word, to MTV, he called the post \"hilarious,which might imply that he's saying that it's mostly, if not entirely, untrue. That might be the case, but then again he could have just said it was untrue and he didn't say that. What he did say, however, is that he doesn't like spoilers. While this may seem odd for the director who's most recent trailer appeared to give away the entire movie, Snyder says that's not the case. Even if you've seen the trailer, you can rest easy, as there is much more we have not seen in then finished film. Says Snyder I have the benefit of seeing the movie. It's cool that think it's too much, and I appreciate people not wanting to know, but there's plenty that they don't know. There's a lot of movie that's not in the trailer. In the process of calling the Batman v Superman Reddit review hilarious, Snyder goes on to talk about how he hates it when spoilers come out. The director would much rather that fans see the movie mostly blind. While he understands that some fans may wish to find the answers before hand, he wants his movies to be mysteries going in. If you're, as an audience member, exploring these articles, looking for answers to questions that you have, maybe you're okay with knowing before you go. It's like an individual taste. But like I said, I want people to see the movie without knowing.Spoilers are a topic that mean different things to different people. While most try to avoid them to some degree, the need to solve the mystery is a nearly universal human experience. We have an inclination to want to know the truth, even while also wanting to be surprised. For most of us getting some information is good, but getting all the information is bad, of course, only getting the details that you want can be difficult."
"The theatrical is choppy, poorly edited, hard to follow, with some really good moments mixed in their. The extended is much more fluent and is much easier to follow, it does have a long runtime, which might make it seem a bit dragging on, but if you like long films done right, like Lord of the Rings, you will like this movie as long as you get into the characters and story. Speaking of which, the story starts out perfectly showing Bruce Wayne as a character, and it is very powerful. There are several moments in this movie that are powerful, emotional, and shocking. Characters. Batman is my favorite fictional character of all time, and believe me when I say, Ben Affleck as Batman was perfect, he had the charisma, the anger, and the look of being through some bad stuff Gal Gadot also does perfect as Wonder Woman, but if you want to really see how good she does, go watch the Wonder Woman movie. Henry Call as Superman. I really don't like it when people say Christopher Reeves is better. Don't get me wrong, Reeves does great, but can you imagine him as Superman in this movie? I wouldn't like it. It would be like Adam West playing Batman in The Dark Knight. Henry Cavill does great in this role, I can say everything about him as I said with Ben Affleck. Jesse Eisenberg as Luthor. I thought it was different in a good way. I've heard a criticism for him as being too much like Joker, but is that a bad thing? Joker is my favorite villain, so to see Superman have an enemy that crazy, but still hold the values Luthor needs to be Luthor, I think it is great. The thing I thought this movie was lacking in the first and second acts was humor, at least good humor. If there was more humor, I would've given this movie a ten because it would give a more relaxing feel to the parts that needed it. All in all though, this movie was awesome, it had powerful moments, it was badass, and just plain fun. It had a great story arc and does its job very well."

"*I will be talking about the Ultimate Edition of the film* This was one of the most anticipated CBM of all time. Ever since the arrival and subsequent success of Marvel's The Avengers people have wondered when will DC launch its own cinematic universe, one of the main reasons being the opportunity to finally see titans such as Batman and Superman share the screen together: the ultimate nerd dream. On 2016, the moment finally came for BvS to be released AND.. it performed poorly. Not only did critical reception left a lot to be desired, but fan reactions where surprisingly split after its cinematic debut. People either loved it and called Zack a genius, or hated it and called him a hack. Me, personally, I found myself with middle of the road feelings, for sure, but more leaning towards the negative side with subsequent viewings. The theatrical cut of the film showcased amazing performances, incredible visuals, and action set pieces that seemed like comic book panels come to life, in a good way. However, when it comes to its narrative structure and more technical aspects like editing, the film was seriously flawed. More plot holes than Age of Ultron, questionable character decisions, random editing that lacked cohesion and focus, and forced dramatic moments that lacked any impact because the attempts at character development ranged from limited to nonexistent, especially when it comes to Superman's character. I thought it was a 5/10 movie at best. As such, I was kind of skeptical about the idea of a 30 minute longer version. I say kind of because I know how Zack works. I remember Watchmen being vastly improved with its director's cut, so in a way I was expecting BvS to perform in a similar manner, but I also feared those 30 minutes wold be just there to amplify action and discredit storytelling issues. Oh boy, I'm so glad I was proved wrong. The ultimate cut of the film was infuriating, but not because it was awful, but because it questions the sanity of WB executives and editors and makes you wonder what were they thinking during the editing process. What I got out of the Ultimate Edition was a thought-provoking deconstruction of two very iconic superheroes that gave spotlight to the struggles both of them face when they aren't fighting crime. What I got was an extremely well produced character study on both Batman and Superman in a cynical world, a world dangerously close to our own. We meet Batman as a ruthless, worn out hero that has seen the failure behind his ideals and witnessed some truly horrifying things in his life. Superman, on the other hand, is portrayed as a godlike figure that seeks to do good in the world, but finds himself emotionally conflicted once he realized that every good deed he does leaves behind a trail of destruction (most of it due to Luthor's antics). In my opinion, this is a hugely original approach, one that distances itself from the rest of the competition and delivers a dark, somber, yet relevant superhero movie that understands both characters and gives them real human struggles to deal with. I felt invested in both of them, and hoped that by the end of the film both could find a way to redeem themselves. Their character arcs were very well established during the first two acts of the movie, and by the time we get to the titular climactic battle the emotion behind the jaw-dropping action is intensified. Lex Luthor as a villain was also given more time to develop with this new edition. One of the main criticisms with the original version was the fact that his plan relied too much on conveniences, and the character's mannerisms and mad-scientist attitude was annoying, and that goes without saying his motivations were unclear. Not only do we spend more time understanding his hate for any godlike figure and thus his hatred for Superman, but the added scenes allowed us to witness his entire plan come to fruition. It sells the cold, manipulative, calculating attributes of his comic counterpart. The acting is spot on. Every actor owns his/her role, from Cavill's Superman, to Ben Affleck as Batman, Eisenberg as Luthor, and Gadot as Wonder Woman, whose scenes are brief, but are more than enough to sell the strong and ferocious warrior that she is. Cinematography is stunning, and miles above that of Man of Steel's. And the soundtrack by Zimmer and Junkie XL? Perfect, just perfect. When it comes to flaws, the film still has some of those. The Martha moment, while serving as a pivotal character moment for Batman, felt off in execution, and its understandable that many people got mad at it. If your main complaint about BvS the first time around was its bleak tone and subject matter, this film is still not for you. I understand most were expecting to see the heroes being the most iconic versions of themselves, clashing in an elongated battle and evoking the same feelings The Avengers gave audiences back in 2012. In that sense, the film will remain divisive, but at least I have the comfort of saying that, at the very least, the film is competently made."

"This film was amazing. Ben Affleck was easily the best part of this movie, he brought his a-game as Batman. The chemistry between Affleck & Irons was outstanding. Gal Gadot did a great job as Wonder Woman. The fight between Batman & Superman was awesome. The final fight with Doomsday was outstanding in every way possible. However, there is only one problem with this film and that's Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor. He was sadly missed cast in this role, but then again it's really the fault of Warner Bros. Studios. Overall, this film deliver on almost every level. I highly recommend that you watch the extended version of this film."

"I know I know. I saw it in theaters too, and felt like it could've been so much better. While the Batman element was good, the narrative felt fractured, and the third act was just one long stunt scene. Superman was relegated to a supporting character, and other characters didn't get a chance to shine. And then I chanced on the ultimate cut. Calling it 30 mins of \"extra\" footage is unfair to Zack Snyder because it's exactly these 30 mins that makes the movie a worthy one. What I can say about the theatrical cut is this - It had the blockbuster elements - music, visuals, stunts, CGI. But, it lacked the human elements. The first 20 mins of the movie had it, but not after that. The extended cut in comparison has a flow to the narrative. There are no disjointed scenes, everything flows smoothly, and there's connective tissue. Superman gets to spend some time with his father, and mother. Clark Kent does some investigative journalism. Superman helps the people after the blast. Lois Lane doesn't jump to conclusions, she gets to the bottom of the crime. Lex Luthor apparently had a coherent plan - everything is explained pretty well. Wonder Woman was already good, so there's no change there :) Also, the \"Martha\" scene seems better executed, because it is a few seconds longer, and there's time to breathe it in. So, here's my take on this movie - The theatrical cut was junk. Get the Bluray for ultimate edition, and you shall not be disappointed. I've seen it so many more times now, and it's the definitive cut. It is the movie we deserve. It's a unique take on Batman, and Superman. It's a gritty take on the superhero movie genre, and definitely the best DCEU movie, and the best DC movie since The Dark Knight.P.S. Yes it's dark. We're adults, and we should appreciate mature film making without intentionally silly moments. It attempts to be philosophical, and something deep instead of just trying to make you chuckle."

"This is one of the best superhero movies ever made. Zack Snyder is a magician behind the camera.The reason behind so many complaints is the fact that Warner Bros. marketed this movie as a fight between Batman and Superman. That's not what it is. It's a movie about the origins of the Justice League.The cinematography, the acting and the score are all second to none. This film is phenomenal.P.S: watch the 3 hour extended cut that Snyder intended you to see, not the 2 and a half hour movie that Warner Bros. decided would be better for theaters."

"I don't care what the critics say, this is a very well-done movie. I'll start my review by listing what I like about the movie.1.) Ben Affleck is the best batman to me and it is not close. He pulls off the role of an aging batman extremely well. Also, Zack Snyder's vision of batman is legit. I have always hated batman up until this adaptation of him. Instead of being a conflicted and idealistic batman, this batman is dark, gritty, and 100% a badass. His equipment is decked out with machine guns and he has no aversion to killing people. In fact, he probably kills about 50 criminal by the time this movie is over. The warehouse scene is the coolest batman scene in any movie.2.) The development of a grudge between batman and superman is pulled off flawlessly. It actually makes sense why batman dislikes superman. Then, when they do fight it is about the coolest thing you can expect to see from a superhero film. 3.) I disagree with a lot of people about Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor. In my opinion, he played his role to perfection. 4.) B v S sets up Wonder Woman and Justice League with Gal Gadot's cameo as Wonder Woman and short clips of Aquaman, the Flash, and Cyborg. B v S is one of my favorite superhero films and rewatching it never gets old."

"The theatrical cut of this film is garbage which is why I rated it eight stars instead of nine. The first time I watched this film I didn't like it (not straight out hate but didn't like). Character motivations didn't make any sense, Lex was annoying as s***, editing was sloppy, and it was overly dark and broody for an action superhero movie. A year + a half, five Marvel films, a ton of bad reviews and a Justice League later a thought popped into my head: \"what if I watched BVS again\". This time I didn't have trailers ruining the best moments, I only vaguely remembered the film, and I was conditioned to look at it negatively but something unexpected happened: I actually loved it. Superman was just a normal person that tried to make a difference cause he could that others imposed their own beliefs on. Lex Luthor was a genius that couldn't stand his powerlessness compared to Superman or more accurately a super being. As Alfred said \"The fever, the rage, the feeling of powerlessness that turns good men... cruel\" and you see the same thought process in Batman. Batman, just like Lex Luthor feels powerless in the midst of a god-being and just like Lex he attempts to destroy him so he can get his sense of power back but unlike Lex, Batman learns something. I what is one of the corniest lines of the movie Superman says, \"Martha\" when he knows he can't win against Batman in a late desperate attempt to save his mother. Not only does this name connect with Bruce Wayne but it also shows what really matters to a man of steel: it isn't power, it isn't fame or anything else, it is his Mother and on a broader scale it is people. Lex (who doesn't care about people at all) knows he doesn't have the power so he creates something from his blood and the remains of Zod: A Doomsday for Superman. Not only does this film have depth but it also doesn't always explain it to you which is rare in a blockbuster action superhero flick normally cater to semi-comic book fans and people that want to shove popcorn in their mouths. This film rewards you for really noticing the details while still having massive explosions. One of my favorites is how Lex has all of Batman's branded killed which is why he isn't afraid of the branding at the end or Grandma's Peach Tea as a way of scaring the s*** out of someone. Of course, this film isn't perfect and I do have personal dislikes. The Batman V Superman fight was slow and pretty boring especially after watching such an amazing fight in Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 2 (If you haven't watched the animated Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 1 and 2 you are sorely missing out on something fantastic). Also, the addition of Wonder Woman who pretty much steals a hacker thing, gives it back and then suits up and fights against a giant monster thing. Not to say I don't like Wonder Woman (She is one of my favorite Superheroes of all time who showed not only can woman kick a** but they also don't need to be ashamed of their sexuality or gender) but she wasn't really that helpful to the plot and just brought in to expand the universe which was well done through Lex's superhuman hunting files. Also, the post-apocalyptic scene that was just a dream could have been cut but nothing is perfect except movies like Citizen Kane which isn't a lot of fun to watch cause it is too perfect. So to summarize, the theatrical cut is bad, the ultimate cut is Amazing and the other cut is meh. Please give it a second chance because it deserves it and save a good director from losing grace because of something he didn't do."
"I really liked it, don't know what all the hate is about. I'm actually a Marvel fan from when I was 7 or so, but Superman and Batman together in 1 movie? Just great. And personally I like Ben Affleck even better than Christian Bale as Batman. So just watch and enjoy, I know I did!"

"That's right. We have been waiting for these two heroes to finally meet and fight against each other. This movie is so good in both plot and special effects.Henry Cavill and Ben Affleck have performed well in their acting stages. They are the best superhero actors and they have filmed their fighting scenes very well. The movie starts to show the conflict between the lives of the heroes and now they have blamed each other for it. This movie is amazing and sets up a good plot for Dawn Justice."

"Actually...I didn't know what to expect. When you see Wonder Woman, you know it will be off of Wonder Woman and off of a Wonder Woman story, but with Batman V Superman, I was like, \"hmmmm, so who is this about?\" It was pretty obvious that it would feature many characters, but I thought the introduction to Batman was amazing. Ben Affleck nailed the part, not only as Batman but also as Bruce Wayne. He is my Batman. Henry Cavill continued to be super as the Man of Steel. And he is my Super - Man. A dark story? Yes, without a doubt. Could it have had a few more jokes? Sure. But not all movies or stories need to have jokes when certain events are serious. I really hope people can see this review and take another look at the movie, because, I loved it. I really hope the ratings can go up, eventually. And P.S, this movie is the perfect set up to Justice League."

"I'll start by making it clear I have only ever seen the Ultimate Edition. I'm aware of what was cut out for the theatrical release, so I will concede up front that most of the criticisms about pacing, editing, and missing bits of plot at release were merited.With that caveat out of the way, I must reiterate that this was bar-none the boldest superhero movie I have ever seen. To me, it was arguably the best as well, though \"best\" shouldn't be taken to mean \"most enjoyable.\" That honor easily goes to \"Thor: Ragnarok.\" What makes BvS stand out among other films in the genre is that it takes two characters who have been done to death since the 1970s and brings them up to date. I recently tried to watch \"Superman: The Movie\" for the first time in a number of years, and while it was still good and Reeves will always be iconic, I just couldn't take it seriously. I'll put it this way: If the story in BvS was \"stupid\" in your view but Superman turning back time by spinning the earth backward on its axis didn't seem like one of the dumbest things you have ever seen -in any movie from any genre- to the extent that it outright ruins the movie for you, then your opinion about BvS isn't worth much. Nostalgic bias was always going to be a problem for this movie, and the way people reacted to and reviewed \"Man of Steel\" was telling in this regard.That brings me to Zack Snyder's take on Superman. You know, that guy whose status as the first extraterrestrial ever encountered by humanity was a total non-issue in the old movies. Apparently, Snyder has a similar view to my own in that his take on the Man of Steel makes his being an alien a core piece of his identity. He may look like any other (absurdly attractive) person, but he knows what he is, and that makes him perpetually uncertain of where he fits in this world. He is essentially good and really does care about people, but he struggles to truly empathize with the likes of us. To be human is to be frail, and that is not something he can easily relate to. This is the root of his conflict with Batman.Just as Clark struggles to genuinely relate to most people, Snyder's Batman either refuses to or otherwise just can't relate to Superman. He doesn't see him as anything but a threat regardless of Superman's clear good intentions. Remember, a small group of Kryptonians were able to bring humanity to the brink of extinction in less than a day, and Bruce Wayne is nothing if not a realist. He didn't know the guy from Kansas. He only knew the god from another world.While Batman's anger toward and fear of Superman are readily apparent from the start, Superman's inability to imagine things from Bruce Wayne's perspective only becomes truly apparent during their first real interaction. This reminded me of the animated version of the \"world's finest\" storyline, where Superman judges Batman harshly for using fear tactics and threats of violence (also, actual violence) to get the job done. Superman wasn't willing to consider what it would take for a human man to fight criminals and save innocents, or what that life would do to him over time. Just as Batman didn't see the guy from Kansas, Superman didn't see the man who lives his life trapped in one brutal, unthinkably traumatic moment (this was beautifully conveyed during the film's opening moments), and had spent his whole adult life bearing witness to humanity at its absolute worst.The conflict between these two characters is as old as human history. They want the same things, but they can't understand one another. So they fight. And what a fight it was.Watching a fight between, say, Captain America and Iron Man was, to me, more frustrating than anything because each understood the other's perspective perfectly. The fight between Batman and Superman in BvS was genuinely gut-wrenching, as intended, because they would have understood one another if either had tried. The whole sequence hilighted Batman's tactical prowess and ability to control a situation. Maybe the most badass thing about the fight was that it ended exactly where Batman planned. That brings me to the big elephant in the room named \"Martha.\"I can't recall exactly which YouTuber put it this way, but if you thought the \"save Martha\" exchange was about their mothers having the same name, you had your brain turned off. The brain-on people have explained this to death, but it bears repeating. This was the moment when Superman became humanized to Batman. He was about to die, and his only concern was for his adoptive human mother. He still believed that the man about to take his life would do the right thing. Even with the cowl on, there was no mistaking the look on Batman's face. It was the look of shame, guilt, and sudden uncertainty that says \"What am I doing?\" Turns out even the most brutal, angry version of Bruce Wayne is better than Tony Stark at knowing right from wrong. At knowing that he had gone too far.From there, the third act was a series of truly impressive (albeit mostly CGI) fight sequences, beginning with what I regard as the undisputed champion of Batman fights. Nothing in the Nolan movies (and especially nothing in the Burton movies) even came close. Go ahead, try to convince yourself that Batman and Bane taking turns punching one another in the face until Bane's mask broke was a good fight sequence. No, this was a fight straight out of \"Arkham Knight,\" and it was glorious. The battle against Doomsday really was one for the books. From the moment Wonder Woman arrived accompanied by the intense sounds of Tina Guo's electric cello to Superman's tragic, heroic death at the hands of Doomsday, I was glued to the screen. Sure, the mere presence of Doomsday spoiled the end to a degree, but watching the Man of Steel laboring to carry that kryptonite spear towards certain death was no less impactful. A brief word on Jesse Eisenberg's take on Lex Luthor. At least one other reviewer on this site already said it best when they pointed out that this was his origin story. If you consider his scheme objectively, he is actually one of the more formidable incarnations of the character. If we're lucky, we'll eventually get to see a Snyder Cut of \"Justice League\" and find out where this story was actually meant to go. For the record, Joss Whedon and Danny Elfman both should have said \"no\" to taking a dump on someone else's art."
"BATMAN V SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE brings a fantastic surprise to a smash-hit team-up with one of the worlds most beloved DC Comics' icons of all time. The movie delivers spectacular casting, and fantastic acting with different characters having their shine in each scenes.The story follows Clark Kent/Superman who becomes a threat, after the destruction in Metropolis in Man Of Steel.(2013). Batman/Bruce Wayne sees him as a threat and begins his war on Superman.The movie brings spectacular storytelling, it tells the complications of human against alien who are on the same side, and the first meeting of Batman and Superman. The story of Bruce Wayne, with his many years of The Caped Crusader, sends him on a spiral of \"out of control\", sheer anger, and builds tension to wanting to defeat the Man of Steel. Snyder has fantastically gave this storytelling an exciting nod to the comics.Lex Luthor, played by Jesse Einsberg, delivers a very interesting performance, but very differently by him showing is his \"origin\" before he becomes a bald foe to the Man of Steel. He shows that his love of \"god vs man\" terrorises mankind when he ultimately creates Doomsday, and Batman realises Superman's inner heroism.It packs so many great \"out of nowhere\" excitement, including a first-look of the fearful Wonder Woman a.k.a. Diana Prince, played by Gal Gadot, and a fresh-new glimpse of the superhero DC canon: The Justice League.WATCH THIS MOVIE! The critics are out of their mind. It's a fun-packed action adventure which still keeps the movie enjoyable until it's final minutes of the movie. It's a FANTASTIC MOVIE! BEN AFFLECK AS BATMAN... is Incredible!A 10/10 overall!"
"I want to go on record as saying that this is a truly thrilling cinematic experience in so many ways. If pressed, I guess I could acknowledge that there were a couple ... let's say \"clumsy\" moments. And in a film that runs to three hours, that hardly seems like a significant issue, certainly not enough to rate it with fewer than 9 stars.This film has everything. There is dramatic tension right from the start. There is a magnificent story arc that picks up quite seamlessly from 'Man of Steel' and propels the viewer not only into the life of Clark Kent/Superman but also of Bruce Wayne/Batman.The villain is no mere cartoon of a villain; he is truly thoroughly (and apparently irrevocably) diabolical. He is a psychopath, and you wish for his death over and over and over. You want Superman to reduce him to ash with the power of his eyes.I have read a number of viewers' reviews, and it seems that the people who disliked the film / gave it a low rating had rather unfair and unrealistic expectations of it. That is, their own prejudices about how the plot could/should unfold or what the character development could/should be, etc. ruined the film for them. And that is a shame.My thought is: I settle into my seat, wait for the lights to dim, and then I wait to be transported by the film. I accept it, lock, stock, and barrel.As another reviewer remarked, I love how the film begins from the point of view of Bruce Wayne as he is among people on the ground who have fallen victim to the attack of Zod and the other Kryptonians.Why would Bruce Wayne not like Superman? Why would the good people of Earth hurl insults at Superman and burn him in effigy (on the news)? Because the good people of Earth just got catapulted into a new reality in which there are not only extraterrestrial beings (surprise!) but they are also superman! And a group of them are hell-bent on destroying humankind and taking the planet for themselves.It is difficult to see Superman as separate from the whole Kryptonian Krew.It seems that many moviegoers forgot that Bruce Wayne is also human. Sure, he's a hero, but he is flawed.. Just like the rest of us. He is a vigilante, after all.He has let his vigilantism get the better of him. HE is actually the one working outside the boundaries of the law, not Superman. It is the clear head of Alfred that shows us that he has gone into a rather dark place, that he has not seen what is really going on (in Luthor's scheme), and so he chooses to embark on his own scheme scheme to take out the alien invader. He is (allegedly) thinking of the future: if he wipes out the all-powerful alien, then it can't turn on humankind in the future. At least, he convinces himself of that.A philosophical question is raised in the film: should Clark Kent have remained a simple man from Kansas and never have become the Superman? Should he just let people die and let calamities happen? The question is answered for us in the character of Diana Prince/Wonder Woman. She withdrew from mankind (her exact words) and just sat around watching. Watching while people died horrible deaths all around her. So, should Superman have done the same? Do these special beings, these 'metahumans', have some kind of moral imperative to intervene, or should they be allowed to be regular people, too? It seems that humans want it both ways.It seems that humans are saying: \"Don't be a superalien ... except when I and my friends and family are in trouble. Then come save us.\""

"Batman v Superman: Ultimate Edition: If your looking for a quick, cheap thrill then you might not enjoy this film at the time. This movies theatrical version was butchered by WB and in doing so reshaped the story leaving numerous plot holes. So the Ultimate Edition is the full story and the one worth seeing. Watch 'Man of Steel' before seeing this movie. There is much to claw through here, so much so that the audience might easily find themselves exhausted from the overall aggression of the film. However, a lot of the story does work. The action is good, and the emotion feels real most of the time.This film is about Superman trying to become Superman. Trying to help the world, save people, find a place in this world not as an outcast, and yet is looked at has a threat by many. Superman is not from this world, yet He is trying to be human, find a place in this world, be excepted by earths people, and come into his destiny.This film is also about Batman being Batman for 20 years and losing faith in humanity, and fearing Superman, what Superman can do with his powers. Great film, great plot, great visuals. ---Yidioo"
"I didn't see the film in the theaters and just bought the \"Extended Edition \" on Amazon. I never properly saw Man of Steel- i think I rented it and watched it when already exhausted and fell asleep. I saw the mediocre user reviews and horrible reviews from critics of this film.They really have it wrong. This is the very best either Batman or Superman. It has a different take, on things. Much darker then earlier films even darker then the Christopher Nolan Batman films.First of all Christopher Nolan is an Executive Producer. So how bad could it be? I loved Sucker Punch and Zack Snyder was involved with that. So how bad could this be? Hans Zimmer did the music, so how bad could it be?I remember watching the old Superman TV shows and reading the Superman and Batman comics as a little kid and loved them, but i wouldn't call myself a \"fan boy\" of comic universes, like so many younger people today. As an older adult I will admit my favorite TV show of all time was Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but watched it on DVD only after it had finished. I saw the second of the Dark Knight series in the theater, but the other two, I watched on DVD. They were great, but not my favorite films like so many people. i also loved the first couple Superman and Batman films in the older series. Regardless, i was not waiting with baited breath to see Man of Steel or this one.I'm more of a serious film fan, who can watch Stanley Kubrick films over and over and my favorite films in the last twenty years, are Eyes Wide Shut and Intersteller, both of which i've watched multiple times.So, with that said, take it from me, the critics have this film very wrong, just as critics hated 2001: A Space Odyssey when it first came out. This film will have lasting appreciation.Surprised how much I liked Ben Afleck's Batman. it was hard to get into Henry Cavil's scrawnier looking Superman, but it grew on me. Amy Adams was great as Lois Lane, The Gal Gadol Wonder Women was amazing. Lex Luther was terrific, like Nolan's Joker. Jeremy Irons was the best Alfred ever. Holly Hunter and Diane Lane was good too. The movie had bad reviews but made a billion dollars. Hopefully everyone buys the Ultimate Edition and it breaks sales records and the film is re-appreciated. I have no idea what scenes this Ultimate Edition added, but it is pretty perfect. Now I can't wait for Wonder Woman and the Justice League and as soon as I finish writing this am going to watch Man of Steal. I'm into it now!I can only surmise that the bad reviews stem from too much expectations of the rigid fan boy types and the radical changes in tone, we see in this film.Total masterpiece of cinema, but I have a few criticisms. There are a few hollow scenes of typical Idiot cops and authorities getting everything wrong in a cliché type way and it has a few filler scenes of that type and a few moments here and there that felt rushed and cheesy. Maybe not everything restored into the Ultimate Edition should have been. I wish there had been more Kevin Costner scenes."

"The whole entire Batman V Superman movie was great and yes even though it felt slow to the majority of the people who watched it but to me I enjoyed every part and every scene of Batman V Superman and when it got to the fight scenes both batman VS Superman and the Doomsday fight it brought so much drama, intensity, and epic performances. So with that being said I give this movie a good 10/10 because it really did go to my expectations and it brought a powerful performance and a powerful yet epic introduction to the upcoming Justice League."

"When I first wrote a review for this movie a year ago exclaiming my excitement for the film, I had been high off a fresh dose of live-action DC superheroes playing out the beloved comic book stories that I had grown up on. It was all playing out before my eyes and coming to life. After a few months had passed, I began to notice things about the movie that I disliked: little gaps in the story, things that didn't add up, etc. My original rating of a 10 / 10 dropped to an 8 /10. But today it has gone back up to a 10. The extended version of the film not only rectifies the gaps but also silences critics.Many claimed that the movie was too dark or that it just didn't make sense. To those people, I say: \"Pick up a comic book!\" Many of the critics of this particular film were part of the superhero bandwagon that formed when Marvel began its spree of Avengers-related films. In fact, its estimated that over 60% of people who go to see 'superhero' genre films have never picked up a comic book in their life. I would argue that similar numbers could figure to those which view the CW televised DC Universe shows. People complain that DC comics is just too dark but the fact is that these movies are based upon actual comics which are meant to be dark (ex: The Dark Knight Returns, Injustice, etc.). Its like complaining that Game of Thrones (the TV series) sucks because they kill off too many characters. Read the books! Its frustrating to see such a beautiful work of art like Batman V Superman criticized by those ignorant to its universe and its meaning. This movie is in fact a catalyst that opens numerous doorways and leaves true fans in awe of the possibilities for future movies. But regardless of whether or not people choose to educate themselves, this film's DVD/Blu-ray extended version puts the theater release to shame. All of the plot holes and gaps are filled in 30 minutes of extended footage scattered throughout the film. The movie ultimately becomes more complete and people will wish that the movie had shown the full 3 hours of footage in its theatrical debut. As a major DC comics fan, I will of course pick up on things that a comics fan would not, but someone who does not read comics would learn to appreciate this film in its entirety with the extended version. Get your hands on a copy today or find it on Netflix or the internet somewhere!"

"I ignored the bad reviews and watched anyways. This film had a lot to live up to after Civil War was released and I went into this film expecting the worst. It ended up to be the best Superhero film of 2016 to me. One complaint was that this film was more concerned about universe building than telling a great story than Civil War but for me it was the other way around; Civil War felt like a build up to something else and to be honest, I felt that way when I saw the other MCU films. Batman vs Superman however not only had a great story, but it also felt a lot more consistent than Civil War. This film was way more diverse with the cast than the MCU but unlike the MCU, I felt like this film doesn't go overboard with the SJW stuff like the MCU films or The Star Wars Sequel films do. The Visuals were AMAZING, The Score by Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL was AMAZING as well, The Tone is just right as I actually felt for the characters emotionally, The Cinematography kept my eyes glued to the screen, and the script felt really Intelligent and Complex and despite people calling the writing confusing, I was able to piece it together with no problem whatsoever. This film is similar to Empire Strikes back in terms of popularity so over time after the other movies are released, this movie would probably be more popular.This film was way better than I Expected and deserves another chance.

"Its shame to see what critics and marvel fans did to this movie and targeted Zack Snyder for it. I have seen this movie more than 25 times till date. And i enjoy this movie as much as i enjoyed the first time. The fans who have read DC comics, wouldn't be disappointed in this movie. Its dark movie, yes it is. Because the title shows the intense situation at hand. Two superheroes about to rip each other apart for whatever reasons that brought them to this stage. Yes it had to be dark and intense.Only marvel can be stupid enough to show an alien invasion where humans are loosing the battle and the super heroes are cracking jokes while battles as if they are playing ping pong. a person playing Call of Duty game is more serious while playing than the marvel heroes fighting aliens."

"Last week some news came out from somebody online who had claimed to have seen a finished version of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. If you were like me, you've been leery of checking it out because you weren't sure how much might actually be true. Now Zack Snyder has spoken out about the spoiler-filled post, although his response doesn't really clear anything up.In a word, to MTV, he called the post \"hilarious,which might imply that he's saying that it's mostly, if not entirely, untrue. That might be the case, but then again he could have just said it was untrue and he didn't say that. What he did say, however, is that he doesn't like spoilers. While this may seem odd for the director who's most recent trailer appeared to give away the entire movie, Snyder says that's not the case. Even if you've seen the trailer, you can rest easy, as there is much more we have not seen in then finished film. Says Snyder I have the benefit of seeing the movie. It's cool that think it's too much, and I appreciate people not wanting to know, but there's plenty that they don't know. There's a lot of movie that's not in the trailer. In the process of calling the Batman v Superman Reddit review hilarious, Snyder goes on to talk about how he hates it when spoilers come out. The director would much rather that fans see the movie mostly blind. While he understands that some fans may wish to find the answers before hand, he wants his movies to be mysteries going in. If you're, as an audience member, exploring these articles, looking for answers to questions that you have, maybe you're okay with knowing before you go. It's like an individual taste. But like I said, I want people to see the movie without knowing.Spoilers are a topic that mean different things to different people. While most try to avoid them to some degree, the need to solve the mystery is a nearly universal human experience. We have an inclination to want to know the truth, even while also wanting to be surprised. For most of us getting some information is good, but getting all the information is bad, of course, only getting the details that you want can be difficult."
"The theatrical is choppy, poorly edited, hard to follow, with some really good moments mixed in their. The extended is much more fluent and is much easier to follow, it does have a long runtime, which might make it seem a bit dragging on, but if you like long films done right, like Lord of the Rings, you will like this movie as long as you get into the characters and story. Speaking of which, the story starts out perfectly showing Bruce Wayne as a character, and it is very powerful. There are several moments in this movie that are powerful, emotional, and shocking. Characters. Batman is my favorite fictional character of all time, and believe me when I say, Ben Affleck as Batman was perfect, he had the charisma, the anger, and the look of being through some bad stuff Gal Gadot also does perfect as Wonder Woman, but if you want to really see how good she does, go watch the Wonder Woman movie. Henry Call as Superman. I really don't like it when people say Christopher Reeves is better. Don't get me wrong, Reeves does great, but can you imagine him as Superman in this movie? I wouldn't like it. It would be like Adam West playing Batman in The Dark Knight. Henry Cavill does great in this role, I can say everything about him as I said with Ben Affleck. Jesse Eisenberg as Luthor. I thought it was different in a good way. I've heard a criticism for him as being too much like Joker, but is that a bad thing? Joker is my favorite villain, so to see Superman have an enemy that crazy, but still hold the values Luthor needs to be Luthor, I think it is great. The thing I thought this movie was lacking in the first and second acts was humor, at least good humor. If there was more humor, I would've given this movie a ten because it would give a more relaxing feel to the parts that needed it. All in all though, this movie was awesome, it had powerful moments, it was badass, and just plain fun. It had a great story arc and does its job very well."

"*I will be talking about the Ultimate Edition of the film* This was one of the most anticipated CBM of all time. Ever since the arrival and subsequent success of Marvel's The Avengers people have wondered when will DC launch its own cinematic universe, one of the main reasons being the opportunity to finally see titans such as Batman and Superman share the screen together: the ultimate nerd dream. On 2016, the moment finally came for BvS to be released AND.. it performed poorly. Not only did critical reception left a lot to be desired, but fan reactions where surprisingly split after its cinematic debut. People either loved it and called Zack a genius, or hated it and called him a hack. Me, personally, I found myself with middle of the road feelings, for sure, but more leaning towards the negative side with subsequent viewings. The theatrical cut of the film showcased amazing performances, incredible visuals, and action set pieces that seemed like comic book panels come to life, in a good way. However, when it comes to its narrative structure and more technical aspects like editing, the film was seriously flawed. More plot holes than Age of Ultron, questionable character decisions, random editing that lacked cohesion and focus, and forced dramatic moments that lacked any impact because the attempts at character development ranged from limited to nonexistent, especially when it comes to Superman's character. I thought it was a 5/10 movie at best. As such, I was kind of skeptical about the idea of a 30 minute longer version. I say kind of because I know how Zack works. I remember Watchmen being vastly improved with its director's cut, so in a way I was expecting BvS to perform in a similar manner, but I also feared those 30 minutes wold be just there to amplify action and discredit storytelling issues. Oh boy, I'm so glad I was proved wrong. The ultimate cut of the film was infuriating, but not because it was awful, but because it questions the sanity of WB executives and editors and makes you wonder what were they thinking during the editing process. What I got out of the Ultimate Edition was a thought-provoking deconstruction of two very iconic superheroes that gave spotlight to the struggles both of them face when they aren't fighting crime. What I got was an extremely well produced character study on both Batman and Superman in a cynical world, a world dangerously close to our own. We meet Batman as a ruthless, worn out hero that has seen the failure behind his ideals and witnessed some truly horrifying things in his life. Superman, on the other hand, is portrayed as a godlike figure that seeks to do good in the world, but finds himself emotionally conflicted once he realized that every good deed he does leaves behind a trail of destruction (most of it due to Luthor's antics). In my opinion, this is a hugely original approach, one that distances itself from the rest of the competition and delivers a dark, somber, yet relevant superhero movie that understands both characters and gives them real human struggles to deal with. I felt invested in both of them, and hoped that by the end of the film both could find a way to redeem themselves. Their character arcs were very well established during the first two acts of the movie, and by the time we get to the titular climactic battle the emotion behind the jaw-dropping action is intensified. Lex Luthor as a villain was also given more time to develop with this new edition. One of the main criticisms with the original version was the fact that his plan relied too much on conveniences, and the character's mannerisms and mad-scientist attitude was annoying, and that goes without saying his motivations were unclear. Not only do we spend more time understanding his hate for any godlike figure and thus his hatred for Superman, but the added scenes allowed us to witness his entire plan come to fruition. It sells the cold, manipulative, calculating attributes of his comic counterpart. The acting is spot on. Every actor owns his/her role, from Cavill's Superman, to Ben Affleck as Batman, Eisenberg as Luthor, and Gadot as Wonder Woman, whose scenes are brief, but are more than enough to sell the strong and ferocious warrior that she is. Cinematography is stunning, and miles above that of Man of Steel's. And the soundtrack by Zimmer and Junkie XL? Perfect, just perfect. When it comes to flaws, the film still has some of those. The Martha moment, while serving as a pivotal character moment for Batman, felt off in execution, and its understandable that many people got mad at it. If your main complaint about BvS the first time around was its bleak tone and subject matter, this film is still not for you. I understand most were expecting to see the heroes being the most iconic versions of themselves, clashing in an elongated battle and evoking the same feelings The Avengers gave audiences back in 2012. In that sense, the film will remain divisive, but at least I have the comfort of saying that, at the very least, the film is competently made."

"This film was amazing. Ben Affleck was easily the best part of this movie, he brought his a-game as Batman. The chemistry between Affleck & Irons was outstanding. Gal Gadot did a great job as Wonder Woman. The fight between Batman & Superman was awesome. The final fight with Doomsday was outstanding in every way possible. However, there is only one problem with this film and that's Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor. He was sadly missed cast in this role, but then again it's really the fault of Warner Bros. Studios. Overall, this film deliver on almost every level. I highly recommend that you watch the extended version of this film."

"I know I know. I saw it in theaters too, and felt like it could've been so much better. While the Batman element was good, the narrative felt fractured, and the third act was just one long stunt scene. Superman was relegated to a supporting character, and other characters didn't get a chance to shine. And then I chanced on the ultimate cut. Calling it 30 mins of \"extra\" footage is unfair to Zack Snyder because it's exactly these 30 mins that makes the movie a worthy one. What I can say about the theatrical cut is this - It had the blockbuster elements - music, visuals, stunts, CGI. But, it lacked the human elements. The first 20 mins of the movie had it, but not after that. The extended cut in comparison has a flow to the narrative. There are no disjointed scenes, everything flows smoothly, and there's connective tissue. Superman gets to spend some time with his father, and mother. Clark Kent does some investigative journalism. Superman helps the people after the blast. Lois Lane doesn't jump to conclusions, she gets to the bottom of the crime. Lex Luthor apparently had a coherent plan - everything is explained pretty well. Wonder Woman was already good, so there's no change there :) Also, the \"Martha\" scene seems better executed, because it is a few seconds longer, and there's time to breathe it in. So, here's my take on this movie - The theatrical cut was junk. Get the Bluray for ultimate edition, and you shall not be disappointed. I've seen it so many more times now, and it's the definitive cut. It is the movie we deserve. It's a unique take on Batman, and Superman. It's a gritty take on the superhero movie genre, and definitely the best DCEU movie, and the best DC movie since The Dark Knight.P.S. Yes it's dark. We're adults, and we should appreciate mature film making without intentionally silly moments. It attempts to be philosophical, and something deep instead of just trying to make you chuckle."

"This is one of the best superhero movies ever made. Zack Snyder is a magician behind the camera.The reason behind so many complaints is the fact that Warner Bros. marketed this movie as a fight between Batman and Superman. That's not what it is. It's a movie about the origins of the Justice League.The cinematography, the acting and the score are all second to none. This film is phenomenal.P.S: watch the 3 hour extended cut that Snyder intended you to see, not the 2 and a half hour movie that Warner Bros. decided would be better for theaters."

"I don't care what the critics say, this is a very well-done movie. I'll start my review by listing what I like about the movie.1.) Ben Affleck is the best batman to me and it is not close. He pulls off the role of an aging batman extremely well. Also, Zack Snyder's vision of batman is legit. I have always hated batman up until this adaptation of him. Instead of being a conflicted and idealistic batman, this batman is dark, gritty, and 100% a badass. His equipment is decked out with machine guns and he has no aversion to killing people. In fact, he probably kills about 50 criminal by the time this movie is over. The warehouse scene is the coolest batman scene in any movie.2.) The development of a grudge between batman and superman is pulled off flawlessly. It actually makes sense why batman dislikes superman. Then, when they do fight it is about the coolest thing you can expect to see from a superhero film. 3.) I disagree with a lot of people about Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor. In my opinion, he played his role to perfection. 4.) B v S sets up Wonder Woman and Justice League with Gal Gadot's cameo as Wonder Woman and short clips of Aquaman, the Flash, and Cyborg. B v S is one of my favorite superhero films and rewatching it never gets old."

"The theatrical cut of this film is garbage which is why I rated it eight stars instead of nine. The first time I watched this film I didn't like it (not straight out hate but didn't like). Character motivations didn't make any sense, Lex was annoying as s***, editing was sloppy, and it was overly dark and broody for an action superhero movie. A year + a half, five Marvel films, a ton of bad reviews and a Justice League later a thought popped into my head: \"what if I watched BVS again\". This time I didn't have trailers ruining the best moments, I only vaguely remembered the film, and I was conditioned to look at it negatively but something unexpected happened: I actually loved it. Superman was just a normal person that tried to make a difference cause he could that others imposed their own beliefs on. Lex Luthor was a genius that couldn't stand his powerlessness compared to Superman or more accurately a super being. As Alfred said \"The fever, the rage, the feeling of powerlessness that turns good men... cruel\" and you see the same thought process in Batman. Batman, just like Lex Luthor feels powerless in the midst of a god-being and just like Lex he attempts to destroy him so he can get his sense of power back but unlike Lex, Batman learns something. I what is one of the corniest lines of the movie Superman says, \"Martha\" when he knows he can't win against Batman in a late desperate attempt to save his mother. Not only does this name connect with Bruce Wayne but it also shows what really matters to a man of steel: it isn't power, it isn't fame or anything else, it is his Mother and on a broader scale it is people. Lex (who doesn't care about people at all) knows he doesn't have the power so he creates something from his blood and the remains of Zod: A Doomsday for Superman. Not only does this film have depth but it also doesn't always explain it to you which is rare in a blockbuster action superhero flick normally cater to semi-comic book fans and people that want to shove popcorn in their mouths. This film rewards you for really noticing the details while still having massive explosions. One of my favorites is how Lex has all of Batman's branded killed which is why he isn't afraid of the branding at the end or Grandma's Peach Tea as a way of scaring the s*** out of someone. Of course, this film isn't perfect and I do have personal dislikes. The Batman V Superman fight was slow and pretty boring especially after watching such an amazing fight in Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 2 (If you haven't watched the animated Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 1 and 2 you are sorely missing out on something fantastic). Also, the addition of Wonder Woman who pretty much steals a hacker thing, gives it back and then suits up and fights against a giant monster thing. Not to say I don't like Wonder Woman (She is one of my favorite Superheroes of all time who showed not only can woman kick a** but they also don't need to be ashamed of their sexuality or gender) but she wasn't really that helpful to the plot and just brought in to expand the universe which was well done through Lex's superhuman hunting files. Also, the post-apocalyptic scene that was just a dream could have been cut but nothing is perfect except movies like Citizen Kane which isn't a lot of fun to watch cause it is too perfect. So to summarize, the theatrical cut is bad, the ultimate cut is Amazing and the other cut is meh. Please give it a second chance because it deserves it and save a good director from losing grace because of something he didn't do."
"I really liked it, don't know what all the hate is about. I'm actually a Marvel fan from when I was 7 or so, but Superman and Batman together in 1 movie? Just great. And personally I like Ben Affleck even better than Christian Bale as Batman. So just watch and enjoy, I know I did!"

"That's right. We have been waiting for these two heroes to finally meet and fight against each other. This movie is so good in both plot and special effects.Henry Cavill and Ben Affleck have performed well in their acting stages. They are the best superhero actors and they have filmed their fighting scenes very well. The movie starts to show the conflict between the lives of the heroes and now they have blamed each other for it. This movie is amazing and sets up a good plot for Dawn Justice."

"Actually...I didn't know what to expect. When you see Wonder Woman, you know it will be off of Wonder Woman and off of a Wonder Woman story, but with Batman V Superman, I was like, \"hmmmm, so who is this about?\" It was pretty obvious that it would feature many characters, but I thought the introduction to Batman was amazing. Ben Affleck nailed the part, not only as Batman but also as Bruce Wayne. He is my Batman. Henry Cavill continued to be super as the Man of Steel. And he is my Super - Man. A dark story? Yes, without a doubt. Could it have had a few more jokes? Sure. But not all movies or stories need to have jokes when certain events are serious. I really hope people can see this review and take another look at the movie, because, I loved it. I really hope the ratings can go up, eventually. And P.S, this movie is the perfect set up to Justice League."

"This film is crucial to the extended universe that DC is trying to build, but it feels highly derivative of better stories and continues to demonstrate the misuse of the iconic characters mentioned in the title. Plus Jesse Eisenberg feels wildly mis-casted."

"I'll start by making it clear I have only ever seen the Ultimate Edition. I'm aware of what was cut out for the theatrical release, so I will concede up front that most of the criticisms about pacing, editing, and missing bits of plot at release were merited.With that caveat out of the way, I must reiterate that this was bar-none the boldest superhero movie I have ever seen. To me, it was arguably the best as well, though \"best\" shouldn't be taken to mean \"most enjoyable.\" That honor easily goes to \"Thor: Ragnarok.\" What makes BvS stand out among other films in the genre is that it takes two characters who have been done to death since the 1970s and brings them up to date. I recently tried to watch \"Superman: The Movie\" for the first time in a number of years, and while it was still good and Reeves will always be iconic, I just couldn't take it seriously. I'll put it this way: If the story in BvS was \"stupid\" in your view but Superman turning back time by spinning the earth backward on its axis didn't seem like one of the dumbest things you have ever seen -in any movie from any genre- to the extent that it outright ruins the movie for you, then your opinion about BvS isn't worth much. Nostalgic bias was always going to be a problem for this movie, and the way people reacted to and reviewed \"Man of Steel\" was telling in this regard.That brings me to Zack Snyder's take on Superman. You know, that guy whose status as the first extraterrestrial ever encountered by humanity was a total non-issue in the old movies. Apparently, Snyder has a similar view to my own in that his take on the Man of Steel makes his being an alien a core piece of his identity. He may look like any other (absurdly attractive) person, but he knows what he is, and that makes him perpetually uncertain of where he fits in this world. He is essentially good and really does care about people, but he struggles to truly empathize with the likes of us. To be human is to be frail, and that is not something he can easily relate to. This is the root of his conflict with Batman.Just as Clark struggles to genuinely relate to most people, Snyder's Batman either refuses to or otherwise just can't relate to Superman. He doesn't see him as anything but a threat regardless of Superman's clear good intentions. Remember, a small group of Kryptonians were able to bring humanity to the brink of extinction in less than a day, and Bruce Wayne is nothing if not a realist. He didn't know the guy from Kansas. He only knew the god from another world.While Batman's anger toward and fear of Superman are readily apparent from the start, Superman's inability to imagine things from Bruce Wayne's perspective only becomes truly apparent during their first real interaction. This reminded me of the animated version of the \"world's finest\" storyline, where Superman judges Batman harshly for using fear tactics and threats of violence (also, actual violence) to get the job done. Superman wasn't willing to consider what it would take for a human man to fight criminals and save innocents, or what that life would do to him over time. Just as Batman didn't see the guy from Kansas, Superman didn't see the man who lives his life trapped in one brutal, unthinkably traumatic moment (this was beautifully conveyed during the film's opening moments), and had spent his whole adult life bearing witness to humanity at its absolute worst.The conflict between these two characters is as old as human history. They want the same things, but they can't understand one another. So they fight. And what a fight it was.Watching a fight between, say, Captain America and Iron Man was, to me, more frustrating than anything because each understood the other's perspective perfectly. The fight between Batman and Superman in BvS was genuinely gut-wrenching, as intended, because they would have understood one another if either had tried. The whole sequence hilighted Batman's tactical prowess and ability to control a situation. Maybe the most badass thing about the fight was that it ended exactly where Batman planned. That brings me to the big elephant in the room named \"Martha.\"I can't recall exactly which YouTuber put it this way, but if you thought the \"save Martha\" exchange was about their mothers having the same name, you had your brain turned off. The brain-on people have explained this to death, but it bears repeating. This was the moment when Superman became humanized to Batman. He was about to die, and his only concern was for his adoptive human mother. He still believed that the man about to take his life would do the right thing. Even with the cowl on, there was no mistaking the look on Batman's face. It was the look of shame, guilt, and sudden uncertainty that says \"What am I doing?\" Turns out even the most brutal, angry version of Bruce Wayne is better than Tony Stark at knowing right from wrong. At knowing that he had gone too far.From there, the third act was a series of truly impressive (albeit mostly CGI) fight sequences, beginning with what I regard as the undisputed champion of Batman fights. Nothing in the Nolan movies (and especially nothing in the Burton movies) even came close. Go ahead, try to convince yourself that Batman and Bane taking turns punching one another in the face until Bane's mask broke was a good fight sequence. No, this was a fight straight out of \"Arkham Knight,\" and it was glorious. The battle against Doomsday really was one for the books. From the moment Wonder Woman arrived accompanied by the intense sounds of Tina Guo's electric cello to Superman's tragic, heroic death at the hands of Doomsday, I was glued to the screen. Sure, the mere presence of Doomsday spoiled the end to a degree, but watching the Man of Steel laboring to carry that kryptonite spear towards certain death was no less impactful. A brief word on Jesse Eisenberg's take on Lex Luthor. At least one other reviewer on this site already said it best when they pointed out that this was his origin story. If you consider his scheme objectively, he is actually one of the more formidable incarnations of the character. If we're lucky, we'll eventually get to see a Snyder Cut of \"Justice League\" and find out where this story was actually meant to go. For the record, Joss Whedon and Danny Elfman both should have said \"no\" to taking a dump on someone else's art."
"BATMAN V SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE brings a fantastic surprise to a smash-hit team-up with one of the worlds most beloved DC Comics' icons of all time. The movie delivers spectacular casting, and fantastic acting with different characters having their shine in each scenes.The story follows Clark Kent/Superman who becomes a threat, after the destruction in Metropolis in Man Of Steel.(2013). Batman/Bruce Wayne sees him as a threat and begins his war on Superman.The movie brings spectacular storytelling, it tells the complications of human against alien who are on the same side, and the first meeting of Batman and Superman. The story of Bruce Wayne, with his many years of The Caped Crusader, sends him on a spiral of \"out of control\", sheer anger, and builds tension to wanting to defeat the Man of Steel. Snyder has fantastically gave this storytelling an exciting nod to the comics.Lex Luthor, played by Jesse Einsberg, delivers a very interesting performance, but very differently by him showing is his \"origin\" before he becomes a bald foe to the Man of Steel. He shows that his love of \"god vs man\" terrorises mankind when he ultimately creates Doomsday, and Batman realises Superman's inner heroism.It packs so many great \"out of nowhere\" excitement, including a first-look of the fearful Wonder Woman a.k.a. Diana Prince, played by Gal Gadot, and a fresh-new glimpse of the superhero DC canon: The Justice League.WATCH THIS MOVIE! The critics are out of their mind. It's a fun-packed action adventure which still keeps the movie enjoyable until it's final minutes of the movie. It's a FANTASTIC MOVIE! BEN AFFLECK AS BATMAN... is Incredible!A 10/10 overall!"
"I want to go on record as saying that this is a truly thrilling cinematic experience in so many ways. If pressed, I guess I could acknowledge that there were a couple ... let's say \"clumsy\" moments. And in a film that runs to three hours, that hardly seems like a significant issue, certainly not enough to rate it with fewer than 9 stars.This film has everything. There is dramatic tension right from the start. There is a magnificent story arc that picks up quite seamlessly from 'Man of Steel' and propels the viewer not only into the life of Clark Kent/Superman but also of Bruce Wayne/Batman.The villain is no mere cartoon of a villain; he is truly thoroughly (and apparently irrevocably) diabolical. He is a psychopath, and you wish for his death over and over and over. You want Superman to reduce him to ash with the power of his eyes.I have read a number of viewers' reviews, and it seems that the people who disliked the film / gave it a low rating had rather unfair and unrealistic expectations of it. That is, their own prejudices about how the plot could/should unfold or what the character development could/should be, etc. ruined the film for them. And that is a shame.My thought is: I settle into my seat, wait for the lights to dim, and then I wait to be transported by the film. I accept it, lock, stock, and barrel.As another reviewer remarked, I love how the film begins from the point of view of Bruce Wayne as he is among people on the ground who have fallen victim to the attack of Zod and the other Kryptonians.Why would Bruce Wayne not like Superman? Why would the good people of Earth hurl insults at Superman and burn him in effigy (on the news)? Because the good people of Earth just got catapulted into a new reality in which there are not only extraterrestrial beings (surprise!) but they are also superman! And a group of them are hell-bent on destroying humankind and taking the planet for themselves.It is difficult to see Superman as separate from the whole Kryptonian Krew.It seems that many moviegoers forgot that Bruce Wayne is also human. Sure, he's a hero, but he is flawed.. Just like the rest of us. He is a vigilante, after all.He has let his vigilantism get the better of him. HE is actually the one working outside the boundaries of the law, not Superman. It is the clear head of Alfred that shows us that he has gone into a rather dark place, that he has not seen what is really going on (in Luthor's scheme), and so he chooses to embark on his own scheme scheme to take out the alien invader. He is (allegedly) thinking of the future: if he wipes out the all-powerful alien, then it can't turn on humankind in the future. At least, he convinces himself of that.A philosophical question is raised in the film: should Clark Kent have remained a simple man from Kansas and never have become the Superman? Should he just let people die and let calamities happen? The question is answered for us in the character of Diana Prince/Wonder Woman. She withdrew from mankind (her exact words) and just sat around watching. Watching while people died horrible deaths all around her. So, should Superman have done the same? Do these special beings, these 'metahumans', have some kind of moral imperative to intervene, or should they be allowed to be regular people, too? It seems that humans want it both ways.It seems that humans are saying: \"Don't be a superalien ... except when I and my friends and family are in trouble. Then come save us.\""

"Batman v Superman: Ultimate Edition: If your looking for a quick, cheap thrill then you might not enjoy this film at the time. This movies theatrical version was butchered by WB and in doing so reshaped the story leaving numerous plot holes. So the Ultimate Edition is the full story and the one worth seeing. Watch 'Man of Steel' before seeing this movie. There is much to claw through here, so much so that the audience might easily find themselves exhausted from the overall aggression of the film. However, a lot of the story does work. The action is good, and the emotion feels real most of the time.This film is about Superman trying to become Superman. Trying to help the world, save people, find a place in this world not as an outcast, and yet is looked at has a threat by many. Superman is not from this world, yet He is trying to be human, find a place in this world, be excepted by earths people, and come into his destiny.This film is also about Batman being Batman for 20 years and losing faith in humanity, and fearing Superman, what Superman can do with his powers. Great film, great plot, great visuals. ---Yidioo"
"I didn't see the film in the theaters and just bought the \"Extended Edition \" on Amazon. I never properly saw Man of Steel- i think I rented it and watched it when already exhausted and fell asleep. I saw the mediocre user reviews and horrible reviews from critics of this film.They really have it wrong. This is the very best either Batman or Superman. It has a different take, on things. Much darker then earlier films even darker then the Christopher Nolan Batman films.First of all Christopher Nolan is an Executive Producer. So how bad could it be? I loved Sucker Punch and Zack Snyder was involved with that. So how bad could this be? Hans Zimmer did the music, so how bad could it be?I remember watching the old Superman TV shows and reading the Superman and Batman comics as a little kid and loved them, but i wouldn't call myself a \"fan boy\" of comic universes, like so many younger people today. As an older adult I will admit my favorite TV show of all time was Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but watched it on DVD only after it had finished. I saw the second of the Dark Knight series in the theater, but the other two, I watched on DVD. They were great, but not my favorite films like so many people. i also loved the first couple Superman and Batman films in the older series. Regardless, i was not waiting with baited breath to see Man of Steel or this one.I'm more of a serious film fan, who can watch Stanley Kubrick films over and over and my favorite films in the last twenty years, are Eyes Wide Shut and Intersteller, both of which i've watched multiple times.So, with that said, take it from me, the critics have this film very wrong, just as critics hated 2001: A Space Odyssey when it first came out. This film will have lasting appreciation.Surprised how much I liked Ben Afleck's Batman. it was hard to get into Henry Cavil's scrawnier looking Superman, but it grew on me. Amy Adams was great as Lois Lane, The Gal Gadol Wonder Women was amazing. Lex Luther was terrific, like Nolan's Joker. Jeremy Irons was the best Alfred ever. Holly Hunter and Diane Lane was good too. The movie had bad reviews but made a billion dollars. Hopefully everyone buys the Ultimate Edition and it breaks sales records and the film is re-appreciated. I have no idea what scenes this Ultimate Edition added, but it is pretty perfect. Now I can't wait for Wonder Woman and the Justice League and as soon as I finish writing this am going to watch Man of Steal. I'm into it now!I can only surmise that the bad reviews stem from too much expectations of the rigid fan boy types and the radical changes in tone, we see in this film.Total masterpiece of cinema, but I have a few criticisms. There are a few hollow scenes of typical Idiot cops and authorities getting everything wrong in a cliché type way and it has a few filler scenes of that type and a few moments here and there that felt rushed and cheesy. Maybe not everything restored into the Ultimate Edition should have been. I wish there had been more Kevin Costner scenes."

"The whole entire Batman V Superman movie was great and yes even though it felt slow to the majority of the people who watched it but to me I enjoyed every part and every scene of Batman V Superman and when it got to the fight scenes both batman VS Superman and the Doomsday fight it brought so much drama, intensity, and epic performances. So with that being said I give this movie a good 10/10 because it really did go to my expectations and it brought a powerful performance and a powerful yet epic introduction to the upcoming Justice League."

"When I first wrote a review for this movie a year ago exclaiming my excitement for the film, I had been high off a fresh dose of live-action DC superheroes playing out the beloved comic book stories that I had grown up on. It was all playing out before my eyes and coming to life. After a few months had passed, I began to notice things about the movie that I disliked: little gaps in the story, things that didn't add up, etc. My original rating of a 10 / 10 dropped to an 8 /10. But today it has gone back up to a 10. The extended version of the film not only rectifies the gaps but also silences critics.Many claimed that the movie was too dark or that it just didn't make sense. To those people, I say: \"Pick up a comic book!\" Many of the critics of this particular film were part of the superhero bandwagon that formed when Marvel began its spree of Avengers-related films. In fact, its estimated that over 60% of people who go to see 'superhero' genre films have never picked up a comic book in their life. I would argue that similar numbers could figure to those which view the CW televised DC Universe shows. People complain that DC comics is just too dark but the fact is that these movies are based upon actual comics which are meant to be dark (ex: The Dark Knight Returns, Injustice, etc.). Its like complaining that Game of Thrones (the TV series) sucks because they kill off too many characters. Read the books! Its frustrating to see such a beautiful work of art like Batman V Superman criticized by those ignorant to its universe and its meaning. This movie is in fact a catalyst that opens numerous doorways and leaves true fans in awe of the possibilities for future movies. But regardless of whether or not people choose to educate themselves, this film's DVD/Blu-ray extended version puts the theater release to shame. All of the plot holes and gaps are filled in 30 minutes of extended footage scattered throughout the film. The movie ultimately becomes more complete and people will wish that the movie had shown the full 3 hours of footage in its theatrical debut. As a major DC comics fan, I will of course pick up on things that a comics fan would not, but someone who does not read comics would learn to appreciate this film in its entirety with the extended version. Get your hands on a copy today or find it on Netflix or the internet somewhere!"

"I ignored the bad reviews and watched anyways. This film had a lot to live up to after Civil War was released and I went into this film expecting the worst. It ended up to be the best Superhero film of 2016 to me. One complaint was that this film was more concerned about universe building than telling a great story than Civil War but for me it was the other way around; Civil War felt like a build up to something else and to be honest, I felt that way when I saw the other MCU films. Batman vs Superman however not only had a great story, but it also felt a lot more consistent than Civil War. This film was way more diverse with the cast than the MCU but unlike the MCU, I felt like this film doesn't go overboard with the SJW stuff like the MCU films or The Star Wars Sequel films do. The Visuals were AMAZING, The Score by Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL was AMAZING as well, The Tone is just right as I actually felt for the characters emotionally, The Cinematography kept my eyes glued to the screen, and the script felt really Intelligent and Complex and despite people calling the writing confusing, I was able to piece it together with no problem whatsoever. This film is similar to Empire Strikes back in terms of popularity so over time after the other movies are released, this movie would probably be more popular.This film was way better than I Expected and deserves another chance.

"Its shame to see what critics and marvel fans did to this movie and targeted Zack Snyder for it. I have seen this movie more than 25 times till date. And i enjoy this movie as much as i enjoyed the first time. The fans who have read DC comics, wouldn't be disappointed in this movie. Its dark movie, yes it is. Because the title shows the intense situation at hand. Two superheroes about to rip each other apart for whatever reasons that brought them to this stage. Yes it had to be dark and intense.Only marvel can be stupid enough to show an alien invasion where humans are loosing the battle and the super heroes are cracking jokes while battles as if they are playing ping pong. a person playing Call of Duty game is more serious while playing than the marvel heroes fighting aliens."

"Last week some news came out from somebody online who had claimed to have seen a finished version of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. If you were like me, you've been leery of checking it out because you weren't sure how much might actually be true. Now Zack Snyder has spoken out about the spoiler-filled post, although his response doesn't really clear anything up.In a word, to MTV, he called the post \"hilarious,which might imply that he's saying that it's mostly, if not entirely, untrue. That might be the case, but then again he could have just said it was untrue and he didn't say that. What he did say, however, is that he doesn't like spoilers. While this may seem odd for the director who's most recent trailer appeared to give away the entire movie, Snyder says that's not the case. Even if you've seen the trailer, you can rest easy, as there is much more we have not seen in then finished film. Says Snyder I have the benefit of seeing the movie. It's cool that think it's too much, and I appreciate people not wanting to know, but there's plenty that they don't know. There's a lot of movie that's not in the trailer. In the process of calling the Batman v Superman Reddit review hilarious, Snyder goes on to talk about how he hates it when spoilers come out. The director would much rather that fans see the movie mostly blind. While he understands that some fans may wish to find the answers before hand, he wants his movies to be mysteries going in. If you're, as an audience member, exploring these articles, looking for answers to questions that you have, maybe you're okay with knowing before you go. It's like an individual taste. But like I said, I want people to see the movie without knowing.Spoilers are a topic that mean different things to different people. While most try to avoid them to some degree, the need to solve the mystery is a nearly universal human experience. We have an inclination to want to know the truth, even while also wanting to be surprised. For most of us getting some information is good, but getting all the information is bad, of course, only getting the details that you want can be difficult."
"The theatrical is choppy, poorly edited, hard to follow, with some really good moments mixed in their. The extended is much more fluent and is much easier to follow, it does have a long runtime, which might make it seem a bit dragging on, but if you like long films done right, like Lord of the Rings, you will like this movie as long as you get into the characters and story. Speaking of which, the story starts out perfectly showing Bruce Wayne as a character, and it is very powerful. There are several moments in this movie that are powerful, emotional, and shocking. Characters. Batman is my favorite fictional character of all time, and believe me when I say, Ben Affleck as Batman was perfect, he had the charisma, the anger, and the look of being through some bad stuff Gal Gadot also does perfect as Wonder Woman, but if you want to really see how good she does, go watch the Wonder Woman movie. Henry Call as Superman. I really don't like it when people say Christopher Reeves is better. Don't get me wrong, Reeves does great, but can you imagine him as Superman in this movie? I wouldn't like it. It would be like Adam West playing Batman in The Dark Knight. Henry Cavill does great in this role, I can say everything about him as I said with Ben Affleck. Jesse Eisenberg as Luthor. I thought it was different in a good way. I've heard a criticism for him as being too much like Joker, but is that a bad thing? Joker is my favorite villain, so to see Superman have an enemy that crazy, but still hold the values Luthor needs to be Luthor, I think it is great. The thing I thought this movie was lacking in the first and second acts was humor, at least good humor. If there was more humor, I would've given this movie a ten because it would give a more relaxing feel to the parts that needed it. All in all though, this movie was awesome, it had powerful moments, it was badass, and just plain fun. It had a great story arc and does its job very well."

"*I will be talking about the Ultimate Edition of the film* This was one of the most anticipated CBM of all time. Ever since the arrival and subsequent success of Marvel's The Avengers people have wondered when will DC launch its own cinematic universe, one of the main reasons being the opportunity to finally see titans such as Batman and Superman share the screen together: the ultimate nerd dream. On 2016, the moment finally came for BvS to be released AND.. it performed poorly. Not only did critical reception left a lot to be desired, but fan reactions where surprisingly split after its cinematic debut. People either loved it and called Zack a genius, or hated it and called him a hack. Me, personally, I found myself with middle of the road feelings, for sure, but more leaning towards the negative side with subsequent viewings. The theatrical cut of the film showcased amazing performances, incredible visuals, and action set pieces that seemed like comic book panels come to life, in a good way. However, when it comes to its narrative structure and more technical aspects like editing, the film was seriously flawed. More plot holes than Age of Ultron, questionable character decisions, random editing that lacked cohesion and focus, and forced dramatic moments that lacked any impact because the attempts at character development ranged from limited to nonexistent, especially when it comes to Superman's character. I thought it was a 5/10 movie at best. As such, I was kind of skeptical about the idea of a 30 minute longer version. I say kind of because I know how Zack works. I remember Watchmen being vastly improved with its director's cut, so in a way I was expecting BvS to perform in a similar manner, but I also feared those 30 minutes wold be just there to amplify action and discredit storytelling issues. Oh boy, I'm so glad I was proved wrong. The ultimate cut of the film was infuriating, but not because it was awful, but because it questions the sanity of WB executives and editors and makes you wonder what were they thinking during the editing process. What I got out of the Ultimate Edition was a thought-provoking deconstruction of two very iconic superheroes that gave spotlight to the struggles both of them face when they aren't fighting crime. What I got was an extremely well produced character study on both Batman and Superman in a cynical world, a world dangerously close to our own. We meet Batman as a ruthless, worn out hero that has seen the failure behind his ideals and witnessed some truly horrifying things in his life. Superman, on the other hand, is portrayed as a godlike figure that seeks to do good in the world, but finds himself emotionally conflicted once he realized that every good deed he does leaves behind a trail of destruction (most of it due to Luthor's antics). In my opinion, this is a hugely original approach, one that distances itself from the rest of the competition and delivers a dark, somber, yet relevant superhero movie that understands both characters and gives them real human struggles to deal with. I felt invested in both of them, and hoped that by the end of the film both could find a way to redeem themselves. Their character arcs were very well established during the first two acts of the movie, and by the time we get to the titular climactic battle the emotion behind the jaw-dropping action is intensified. Lex Luthor as a villain was also given more time to develop with this new edition. One of the main criticisms with the original version was the fact that his plan relied too much on conveniences, and the character's mannerisms and mad-scientist attitude was annoying, and that goes without saying his motivations were unclear. Not only do we spend more time understanding his hate for any godlike figure and thus his hatred for Superman, but the added scenes allowed us to witness his entire plan come to fruition. It sells the cold, manipulative, calculating attributes of his comic counterpart. The acting is spot on. Every actor owns his/her role, from Cavill's Superman, to Ben Affleck as Batman, Eisenberg as Luthor, and Gadot as Wonder Woman, whose scenes are brief, but are more than enough to sell the strong and ferocious warrior that she is. Cinematography is stunning, and miles above that of Man of Steel's. And the soundtrack by Zimmer and Junkie XL? Perfect, just perfect. When it comes to flaws, the film still has some of those. The Martha moment, while serving as a pivotal character moment for Batman, felt off in execution, and its understandable that many people got mad at it. If your main complaint about BvS the first time around was its bleak tone and subject matter, this film is still not for you. I understand most were expecting to see the heroes being the most iconic versions of themselves, clashing in an elongated battle and evoking the same feelings The Avengers gave audiences back in 2012. In that sense, the film will remain divisive, but at least I have the comfort of saying that, at the very least, the film is competently made."

"This film was amazing. Ben Affleck was easily the best part of this movie, he brought his a-game as Batman. The chemistry between Affleck & Irons was outstanding. Gal Gadot did a great job as Wonder Woman. The fight between Batman & Superman was awesome. The final fight with Doomsday was outstanding in every way possible. However, there is only one problem with this film and that's Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor. He was sadly missed cast in this role, but then again it's really the fault of Warner Bros. Studios. Overall, this film deliver on almost every level. I highly recommend that you watch the extended version of this film."

"I know I know. I saw it in theaters too, and felt like it could've been so much better. While the Batman element was good, the narrative felt fractured, and the third act was just one long stunt scene. Superman was relegated to a supporting character, and other characters didn't get a chance to shine. And then I chanced on the ultimate cut. Calling it 30 mins of \"extra\" footage is unfair to Zack Snyder because it's exactly these 30 mins that makes the movie a worthy one. What I can say about the theatrical cut is this - It had the blockbuster elements - music, visuals, stunts, CGI. But, it lacked the human elements. The first 20 mins of the movie had it, but not after that. The extended cut in comparison has a flow to the narrative. There are no disjointed scenes, everything flows smoothly, and there's connective tissue. Superman gets to spend some time with his father, and mother. Clark Kent does some investigative journalism. Superman helps the people after the blast. Lois Lane doesn't jump to conclusions, she gets to the bottom of the crime. Lex Luthor apparently had a coherent plan - everything is explained pretty well. Wonder Woman was already good, so there's no change there :) Also, the \"Martha\" scene seems better executed, because it is a few seconds longer, and there's time to breathe it in. So, here's my take on this movie - The theatrical cut was junk. Get the Bluray for ultimate edition, and you shall not be disappointed. I've seen it so many more times now, and it's the definitive cut. It is the movie we deserve. It's a unique take on Batman, and Superman. It's a gritty take on the superhero movie genre, and definitely the best DCEU movie, and the best DC movie since The Dark Knight.P.S. Yes it's dark. We're adults, and we should appreciate mature film making without intentionally silly moments. It attempts to be philosophical, and something deep instead of just trying to make you chuckle."

"This is one of the best superhero movies ever made. Zack Snyder is a magician behind the camera.The reason behind so many complaints is the fact that Warner Bros. marketed this movie as a fight between Batman and Superman. That's not what it is. It's a movie about the origins of the Justice League.The cinematography, the acting and the score are all second to none. This film is phenomenal.P.S: watch the 3 hour extended cut that Snyder intended you to see, not the 2 and a half hour movie that Warner Bros. decided would be better for theaters."

"I don't care what the critics say, this is a very well-done movie. I'll start my review by listing what I like about the movie.1.) Ben Affleck is the best batman to me and it is not close. He pulls off the role of an aging batman extremely well. Also, Zack Snyder's vision of batman is legit. I have always hated batman up until this adaptation of him. Instead of being a conflicted and idealistic batman, this batman is dark, gritty, and 100% a badass. His equipment is decked out with machine guns and he has no aversion to killing people. In fact, he probably kills about 50 criminal by the time this movie is over. The warehouse scene is the coolest batman scene in any movie.2.) The development of a grudge between batman and superman is pulled off flawlessly. It actually makes sense why batman dislikes superman. Then, when they do fight it is about the coolest thing you can expect to see from a superhero film. 3.) I disagree with a lot of people about Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor. In my opinion, he played his role to perfection. 4.) B v S sets up Wonder Woman and Justice League with Gal Gadot's cameo as Wonder Woman and short clips of Aquaman, the Flash, and Cyborg. B v S is one of my favorite superhero films and rewatching it never gets old."

"The theatrical cut of this film is garbage which is why I rated it eight stars instead of nine. The first time I watched this film I didn't like it (not straight out hate but didn't like). Character motivations didn't make any sense, Lex was annoying as s***, editing was sloppy, and it was overly dark and broody for an action superhero movie. A year + a half, five Marvel films, a ton of bad reviews and a Justice League later a thought popped into my head: \"what if I watched BVS again\". This time I didn't have trailers ruining the best moments, I only vaguely remembered the film, and I was conditioned to look at it negatively but something unexpected happened: I actually loved it. Superman was just a normal person that tried to make a difference cause he could that others imposed their own beliefs on. Lex Luthor was a genius that couldn't stand his powerlessness compared to Superman or more accurately a super being. As Alfred said \"The fever, the rage, the feeling of powerlessness that turns good men... cruel\" and you see the same thought process in Batman. Batman, just like Lex Luthor feels powerless in the midst of a god-being and just like Lex he attempts to destroy him so he can get his sense of power back but unlike Lex, Batman learns something. I what is one of the corniest lines of the movie Superman says, \"Martha\" when he knows he can't win against Batman in a late desperate attempt to save his mother. Not only does this name connect with Bruce Wayne but it also shows what really matters to a man of steel: it isn't power, it isn't fame or anything else, it is his Mother and on a broader scale it is people. Lex (who doesn't care about people at all) knows he doesn't have the power so he creates something from his blood and the remains of Zod: A Doomsday for Superman. Not only does this film have depth but it also doesn't always explain it to you which is rare in a blockbuster action superhero flick normally cater to semi-comic book fans and people that want to shove popcorn in their mouths. This film rewards you for really noticing the details while still having massive explosions. One of my favorites is how Lex has all of Batman's branded killed which is why he isn't afraid of the branding at the end or Grandma's Peach Tea as a way of scaring the s*** out of someone. Of course, this film isn't perfect and I do have personal dislikes. The Batman V Superman fight was slow and pretty boring especially after watching such an amazing fight in Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 2 (If you haven't watched the animated Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 1 and 2 you are sorely missing out on something fantastic). Also, the addition of Wonder Woman who pretty much steals a hacker thing, gives it back and then suits up and fights against a giant monster thing. Not to say I don't like Wonder Woman (She is one of my favorite Superheroes of all time who showed not only can woman kick a** but they also don't need to be ashamed of their sexuality or gender) but she wasn't really that helpful to the plot and just brought in to expand the universe which was well done through Lex's superhuman hunting files. Also, the post-apocalyptic scene that was just a dream could have been cut but nothing is perfect except movies like Citizen Kane which isn't a lot of fun to watch cause it is too perfect. So to summarize, the theatrical cut is bad, the ultimate cut is Amazing and the other cut is meh. Please give it a second chance because it deserves it and save a good director from losing grace because of something he didn't do."
"I really liked it, don't know what all the hate is about. I'm actually a Marvel fan from when I was 7 or so, but Superman and Batman together in 1 movie? Just great. And personally I like Ben Affleck even better than Christian Bale as Batman. So just watch and enjoy, I know I did!"

"That's right. We have been waiting for these two heroes to finally meet and fight against each other. This movie is so good in both plot and special effects.Henry Cavill and Ben Affleck have performed well in their acting stages. They are the best superhero actors and they have filmed their fighting scenes very well. The movie starts to show the conflict between the lives of the heroes and now they have blamed each other for it. This movie is amazing and sets up a good plot for Dawn Justice."

"Actually...I didn't know what to expect. When you see Wonder Woman, you know it will be off of Wonder Woman and off of a Wonder Woman story, but with Batman V Superman, I was like, \"hmmmm, so who is this about?\" It was pretty obvious that it would feature many characters, but I thought the introduction to Batman was amazing. Ben Affleck nailed the part, not only as Batman but also as Bruce Wayne. He is my Batman. Henry Cavill continued to be super as the Man of Steel. And he is my Super - Man. A dark story? Yes, without a doubt. Could it have had a few more jokes? Sure. But not all movies or stories need to have jokes when certain events are serious. I really hope people can see this review and take another look at the movie, because, I loved it. I really hope the ratings can go up, eventually. And P.S, this movie is the perfect set up to Justice League."

"I'll start by making it clear I have only ever seen the Ultimate Edition. I'm aware of what was cut out for the theatrical release, so I will concede up front that most of the criticisms about pacing, editing, and missing bits of plot at release were merited.With that caveat out of the way, I must reiterate that this was bar-none the boldest superhero movie I have ever seen. To me, it was arguably the best as well, though \"best\" shouldn't be taken to mean \"most enjoyable.\" That honor easily goes to \"Thor: Ragnarok.\" What makes BvS stand out among other films in the genre is that it takes two characters who have been done to death since the 1970s and brings them up to date. I recently tried to watch \"Superman: The Movie\" for the first time in a number of years, and while it was still good and Reeves will always be iconic, I just couldn't take it seriously. I'll put it this way: If the story in BvS was \"stupid\" in your view but Superman turning back time by spinning the earth backward on its axis didn't seem like one of the dumbest things you have ever seen -in any movie from any genre- to the extent that it outright ruins the movie for you, then your opinion about BvS isn't worth much. Nostalgic bias was always going to be a problem for this movie, and the way people reacted to and reviewed \"Man of Steel\" was telling in this regard.That brings me to Zack Snyder's take on Superman. You know, that guy whose status as the first extraterrestrial ever encountered by humanity was a total non-issue in the old movies. Apparently, Snyder has a similar view to my own in that his take on the Man of Steel makes his being an alien a core piece of his identity. He may look like any other (absurdly attractive) person, but he knows what he is, and that makes him perpetually uncertain of where he fits in this world. He is essentially good and really does care about people, but he struggles to truly empathize with the likes of us. To be human is to be frail, and that is not something he can easily relate to. This is the root of his conflict with Batman.Just as Clark struggles to genuinely relate to most people, Snyder's Batman either refuses to or otherwise just can't relate to Superman. He doesn't see him as anything but a threat regardless of Superman's clear good intentions. Remember, a small group of Kryptonians were able to bring humanity to the brink of extinction in less than a day, and Bruce Wayne is nothing if not a realist. He didn't know the guy from Kansas. He only knew the god from another world.While Batman's anger toward and fear of Superman are readily apparent from the start, Superman's inability to imagine things from Bruce Wayne's perspective only becomes truly apparent during their first real interaction. This reminded me of the animated version of the \"world's finest\" storyline, where Superman judges Batman harshly for using fear tactics and threats of violence (also, actual violence) to get the job done. Superman wasn't willing to consider what it would take for a human man to fight criminals and save innocents, or what that life would do to him over time. Just as Batman didn't see the guy from Kansas, Superman didn't see the man who lives his life trapped in one brutal, unthinkably traumatic moment (this was beautifully conveyed during the film's opening moments), and had spent his whole adult life bearing witness to humanity at its absolute worst.The conflict between these two characters is as old as human history. They want the same things, but they can't understand one another. So they fight. And what a fight it was.Watching a fight between, say, Captain America and Iron Man was, to me, more frustrating than anything because each understood the other's perspective perfectly. The fight between Batman and Superman in BvS was genuinely gut-wrenching, as intended, because they would have understood one another if either had tried. The whole sequence hilighted Batman's tactical prowess and ability to control a situation. Maybe the most badass thing about the fight was that it ended exactly where Batman planned. That brings me to the big elephant in the room named \"Martha.\"I can't recall exactly which YouTuber put it this way, but if you thought the \"save Martha\" exchange was about their mothers having the same name, you had your brain turned off. The brain-on people have explained this to death, but it bears repeating. This was the moment when Superman became humanized to Batman. He was about to die, and his only concern was for his adoptive human mother. He still believed that the man about to take his life would do the right thing. Even with the cowl on, there was no mistaking the look on Batman's face. It was the look of shame, guilt, and sudden uncertainty that says \"What am I doing?\" Turns out even the most brutal, angry version of Bruce Wayne is better than Tony Stark at knowing right from wrong. At knowing that he had gone too far.From there, the third act was a series of truly impressive (albeit mostly CGI) fight sequences, beginning with what I regard as the undisputed champion of Batman fights. Nothing in the Nolan movies (and especially nothing in the Burton movies) even came close. Go ahead, try to convince yourself that Batman and Bane taking turns punching one another in the face until Bane's mask broke was a good fight sequence. No, this was a fight straight out of \"Arkham Knight,\" and it was glorious. The battle against Doomsday really was one for the books. From the moment Wonder Woman arrived accompanied by the intense sounds of Tina Guo's electric cello to Superman's tragic, heroic death at the hands of Doomsday, I was glued to the screen. Sure, the mere presence of Doomsday spoiled the end to a degree, but watching the Man of Steel laboring to carry that kryptonite spear towards certain death was no less impactful. A brief word on Jesse Eisenberg's take on Lex Luthor. At least one other reviewer on this site already said it best when they pointed out that this was his origin story. If you consider his scheme objectively, he is actually one of the more formidable incarnations of the character. If we're lucky, we'll eventually get to see a Snyder Cut of \"Justice League\" and find out where this story was actually meant to go. For the record, Joss Whedon and Danny Elfman both should have said \"no\" to taking a dump on someone else's art."
"BATMAN V SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE brings a fantastic surprise to a smash-hit team-up with one of the worlds most beloved DC Comics' icons of all time. The movie delivers spectacular casting, and fantastic acting with different characters having their shine in each scenes.The story follows Clark Kent/Superman who becomes a threat, after the destruction in Metropolis in Man Of Steel.(2013). Batman/Bruce Wayne sees him as a threat and begins his war on Superman.The movie brings spectacular storytelling, it tells the complications of human against alien who are on the same side, and the first meeting of Batman and Superman. The story of Bruce Wayne, with his many years of The Caped Crusader, sends him on a spiral of \"out of control\", sheer anger, and builds tension to wanting to defeat the Man of Steel. Snyder has fantastically gave this storytelling an exciting nod to the comics.Lex Luthor, played by Jesse Einsberg, delivers a very interesting performance, but very differently by him showing is his \"origin\" before he becomes a bald foe to the Man of Steel. He shows that his love of \"god vs man\" terrorises mankind when he ultimately creates Doomsday, and Batman realises Superman's inner heroism.It packs so many great \"out of nowhere\" excitement, including a first-look of the fearful Wonder Woman a.k.a. Diana Prince, played by Gal Gadot, and a fresh-new glimpse of the superhero DC canon: The Justice League.WATCH THIS MOVIE! The critics are out of their mind. It's a fun-packed action adventure which still keeps the movie enjoyable until it's final minutes of the movie. It's a FANTASTIC MOVIE! BEN AFFLECK AS BATMAN... is Incredible!A 10/10 overall!"
"I want to go on record as saying that this is a truly thrilling cinematic experience in so many ways. If pressed, I guess I could acknowledge that there were a couple ... let's say \"clumsy\" moments. And in a film that runs to three hours, that hardly seems like a significant issue, certainly not enough to rate it with fewer than 9 stars.This film has everything. There is dramatic tension right from the start. There is a magnificent story arc that picks up quite seamlessly from 'Man of Steel' and propels the viewer not only into the life of Clark Kent/Superman but also of Bruce Wayne/Batman.The villain is no mere cartoon of a villain; he is truly thoroughly (and apparently irrevocably) diabolical. He is a psychopath, and you wish for his death over and over and over. You want Superman to reduce him to ash with the power of his eyes.I have read a number of viewers' reviews, and it seems that the people who disliked the film / gave it a low rating had rather unfair and unrealistic expectations of it. That is, their own prejudices about how the plot could/should unfold or what the character development could/should be, etc. ruined the film for them. And that is a shame.My thought is: I settle into my seat, wait for the lights to dim, and then I wait to be transported by the film. I accept it, lock, stock, and barrel.As another reviewer remarked, I love how the film begins from the point of view of Bruce Wayne as he is among people on the ground who have fallen victim to the attack of Zod and the other Kryptonians.Why would Bruce Wayne not like Superman? Why would the good people of Earth hurl insults at Superman and burn him in effigy (on the news)? Because the good people of Earth just got catapulted into a new reality in which there are not only extraterrestrial beings (surprise!) but they are also superman! And a group of them are hell-bent on destroying humankind and taking the planet for themselves.It is difficult to see Superman as separate from the whole Kryptonian Krew.It seems that many moviegoers forgot that Bruce Wayne is also human. Sure, he's a hero, but he is flawed.. Just like the rest of us. He is a vigilante, after all.He has let his vigilantism get the better of him. HE is actually the one working outside the boundaries of the law, not Superman. It is the clear head of Alfred that shows us that he has gone into a rather dark place, that he has not seen what is really going on (in Luthor's scheme), and so he chooses to embark on his own scheme scheme to take out the alien invader. He is (allegedly) thinking of the future: if he wipes out the all-powerful alien, then it can't turn on humankind in the future. At least, he convinces himself of that.A philosophical question is raised in the film: should Clark Kent have remained a simple man from Kansas and never have become the Superman? Should he just let people die and let calamities happen? The question is answered for us in the character of Diana Prince/Wonder Woman. She withdrew from mankind (her exact words) and just sat around watching. Watching while people died horrible deaths all around her. So, should Superman have done the same? Do these special beings, these 'metahumans', have some kind of moral imperative to intervene, or should they be allowed to be regular people, too? It seems that humans want it both ways.It seems that humans are saying: \"Don't be a superalien ... except when I and my friends and family are in trouble. Then come save us.\""

"Batman v Superman: Ultimate Edition: If your looking for a quick, cheap thrill then you might not enjoy this film at the time. This movies theatrical version was butchered by WB and in doing so reshaped the story leaving numerous plot holes. So the Ultimate Edition is the full story and the one worth seeing. Watch 'Man of Steel' before seeing this movie. There is much to claw through here, so much so that the audience might easily find themselves exhausted from the overall aggression of the film. However, a lot of the story does work. The action is good, and the emotion feels real most of the time.This film is about Superman trying to become Superman. Trying to help the world, save people, find a place in this world not as an outcast, and yet is looked at has a threat by many. Superman is not from this world, yet He is trying to be human, find a place in this world, be excepted by earths people, and come into his destiny.This film is also about Batman being Batman for 20 years and losing faith in humanity, and fearing Superman, what Superman can do with his powers. Great film, great plot, great visuals. ---Yidioo"
"I didn't see the film in the theaters and just bought the \"Extended Edition \" on Amazon. I never properly saw Man of Steel- i think I rented it and watched it when already exhausted and fell asleep. I saw the mediocre user reviews and horrible reviews from critics of this film.They really have it wrong. This is the very best either Batman or Superman. It has a different take, on things. Much darker then earlier films even darker then the Christopher Nolan Batman films.First of all Christopher Nolan is an Executive Producer. So how bad could it be? I loved Sucker Punch and Zack Snyder was involved with that. So how bad could this be? Hans Zimmer did the music, so how bad could it be?I remember watching the old Superman TV shows and reading the Superman and Batman comics as a little kid and loved them, but i wouldn't call myself a \"fan boy\" of comic universes, like so many younger people today. As an older adult I will admit my favorite TV show of all time was Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but watched it on DVD only after it had finished. I saw the second of the Dark Knight series in the theater, but the other two, I watched on DVD. They were great, but not my favorite films like so many people. i also loved the first couple Superman and Batman films in the older series. Regardless, i was not waiting with baited breath to see Man of Steel or this one.I'm more of a serious film fan, who can watch Stanley Kubrick films over and over and my favorite films in the last twenty years, are Eyes Wide Shut and Intersteller, both of which i've watched multiple times.So, with that said, take it from me, the critics have this film very wrong, just as critics hated 2001: A Space Odyssey when it first came out. This film will have lasting appreciation.Surprised how much I liked Ben Afleck's Batman. it was hard to get into Henry Cavil's scrawnier looking Superman, but it grew on me. Amy Adams was great as Lois Lane, The Gal Gadol Wonder Women was amazing. Lex Luther was terrific, like Nolan's Joker. Jeremy Irons was the best Alfred ever. Holly Hunter and Diane Lane was good too. The movie had bad reviews but made a billion dollars. Hopefully everyone buys the Ultimate Edition and it breaks sales records and the film is re-appreciated. I have no idea what scenes this Ultimate Edition added, but it is pretty perfect. Now I can't wait for Wonder Woman and the Justice League and as soon as I finish writing this am going to watch Man of Steal. I'm into it now!I can only surmise that the bad reviews stem from too much expectations of the rigid fan boy types and the radical changes in tone, we see in this film.Total masterpiece of cinema, but I have a few criticisms. There are a few hollow scenes of typical Idiot cops and authorities getting everything wrong in a cliché type way and it has a few filler scenes of that type and a few moments here and there that felt rushed and cheesy. Maybe not everything restored into the Ultimate Edition should have been. I wish there had been more Kevin Costner scenes."

"The whole entire Batman V Superman movie was great and yes even though it felt slow to the majority of the people who watched it but to me I enjoyed every part and every scene of Batman V Superman and when it got to the fight scenes both batman VS Superman and the Doomsday fight it brought so much drama, intensity, and epic performances. So with that being said I give this movie a good 10/10 because it really did go to my expectations and it brought a powerful performance and a powerful yet epic introduction to the upcoming Justice League."

"When I first wrote a review for this movie a year ago exclaiming my excitement for the film, I had been high off a fresh dose of live-action DC superheroes playing out the beloved comic book stories that I had grown up on. It was all playing out before my eyes and coming to life. After a few months had passed, I began to notice things about the movie that I disliked: little gaps in the story, things that didn't add up, etc. My original rating of a 10 / 10 dropped to an 8 /10. But today it has gone back up to a 10. The extended version of the film not only rectifies the gaps but also silences critics.Many claimed that the movie was too dark or that it just didn't make sense. To those people, I say: \"Pick up a comic book!\" Many of the critics of this particular film were part of the superhero bandwagon that formed when Marvel began its spree of Avengers-related films. In fact, its estimated that over 60% of people who go to see 'superhero' genre films have never picked up a comic book in their life. I would argue that similar numbers could figure to those which view the CW televised DC Universe shows. People complain that DC comics is just too dark but the fact is that these movies are based upon actual comics which are meant to be dark (ex: The Dark Knight Returns, Injustice, etc.). Its like complaining that Game of Thrones (the TV series) sucks because they kill off too many characters. Read the books! Its frustrating to see such a beautiful work of art like Batman V Superman criticized by those ignorant to its universe and its meaning. This movie is in fact a catalyst that opens numerous doorways and leaves true fans in awe of the possibilities for future movies. But regardless of whether or not people choose to educate themselves, this film's DVD/Blu-ray extended version puts the theater release to shame. All of the plot holes and gaps are filled in 30 minutes of extended footage scattered throughout the film. The movie ultimately becomes more complete and people will wish that the movie had shown the full 3 hours of footage in its theatrical debut. As a major DC comics fan, I will of course pick up on things that a comics fan would not, but someone who does not read comics would learn to appreciate this film in its entirety with the extended version. Get your hands on a copy today or find it on Netflix or the internet somewhere!"

"I ignored the bad reviews and watched anyways. This film had a lot to live up to after Civil War was released and I went into this film expecting the worst. It ended up to be the best Superhero film of 2016 to me. One complaint was that this film was more concerned about universe building than telling a great story than Civil War but for me it was the other way around; Civil War felt like a build up to something else and to be honest, I felt that way when I saw the other MCU films. Batman vs Superman however not only had a great story, but it also felt a lot more consistent than Civil War. This film was way more diverse with the cast than the MCU but unlike the MCU, I felt like this film doesn't go overboard with the SJW stuff like the MCU films or The Star Wars Sequel films do. The Visuals were AMAZING, The Score by Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL was AMAZING as well, The Tone is just right as I actually felt for the characters emotionally, The Cinematography kept my eyes glued to the screen, and the script felt really Intelligent and Complex and despite people calling the writing confusing, I was able to piece it together with no problem whatsoever. This film is similar to Empire Strikes back in terms of popularity so over time after the other movies are released, this movie would probably be more popular.This film was way better than I Expected and deserves another chance.

"Its shame to see what critics and marvel fans did to this movie and targeted Zack Snyder for it. I have seen this movie more than 25 times till date. And i enjoy this movie as much as i enjoyed the first time. The fans who have read DC comics, wouldn't be disappointed in this movie. Its dark movie, yes it is. Because the title shows the intense situation at hand. Two superheroes about to rip each other apart for whatever reasons that brought them to this stage. Yes it had to be dark and intense.Only marvel can be stupid enough to show an alien invasion where humans are loosing the battle and the super heroes are cracking jokes while battles as if they are playing ping pong. a person playing Call of Duty game is more serious while playing than the marvel heroes fighting aliens."

"Last week some news came out from somebody online who had claimed to have seen a finished version of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. If you were like me, you've been leery of checking it out because you weren't sure how much might actually be true. Now Zack Snyder has spoken out about the spoiler-filled post, although his response doesn't really clear anything up.In a word, to MTV, he called the post \"hilarious,which might imply that he's saying that it's mostly, if not entirely, untrue. That might be the case, but then again he could have just said it was untrue and he didn't say that. What he did say, however, is that he doesn't like spoilers. While this may seem odd for the director who's most recent trailer appeared to give away the entire movie, Snyder says that's not the case. Even if you've seen the trailer, you can rest easy, as there is much more we have not seen in then finished film. Says Snyder I have the benefit of seeing the movie. It's cool that think it's too much, and I appreciate people not wanting to know, but there's plenty that they don't know. There's a lot of movie that's not in the trailer. In the process of calling the Batman v Superman Reddit review hilarious, Snyder goes on to talk about how he hates it when spoilers come out. The director would much rather that fans see the movie mostly blind. While he understands that some fans may wish to find the answers before hand, he wants his movies to be mysteries going in. If you're, as an audience member, exploring these articles, looking for answers to questions that you have, maybe you're okay with knowing before you go. It's like an individual taste. But like I said, I want people to see the movie without knowing.Spoilers are a topic that mean different things to different people. While most try to avoid them to some degree, the need to solve the mystery is a nearly universal human experience. We have an inclination to want to know the truth, even while also wanting to be surprised. For most of us getting some information is good, but getting all the information is bad, of course, only getting the details that you want can be difficult."
"The theatrical is choppy, poorly edited, hard to follow, with some really good moments mixed in their. The extended is much more fluent and is much easier to follow, it does have a long runtime, which might make it seem a bit dragging on, but if you like long films done right, like Lord of the Rings, you will like this movie as long as you get into the characters and story. Speaking of which, the story starts out perfectly showing Bruce Wayne as a character, and it is very powerful. There are several moments in this movie that are powerful, emotional, and shocking. Characters. Batman is my favorite fictional character of all time, and believe me when I say, Ben Affleck as Batman was perfect, he had the charisma, the anger, and the look of being through some bad stuff Gal Gadot also does perfect as Wonder Woman, but if you want to really see how good she does, go watch the Wonder Woman movie. Henry Call as Superman. I really don't like it when people say Christopher Reeves is better. Don't get me wrong, Reeves does great, but can you imagine him as Superman in this movie? I wouldn't like it. It would be like Adam West playing Batman in The Dark Knight. Henry Cavill does great in this role, I can say everything about him as I said with Ben Affleck. Jesse Eisenberg as Luthor. I thought it was different in a good way. I've heard a criticism for him as being too much like Joker, but is that a bad thing? Joker is my favorite villain, so to see Superman have an enemy that crazy, but still hold the values Luthor needs to be Luthor, I think it is great. The thing I thought this movie was lacking in the first and second acts was humor, at least good humor. If there was more humor, I would've given this movie a ten because it would give a more relaxing feel to the parts that needed it. All in all though, this movie was awesome, it had powerful moments, it was badass, and just plain fun. It had a great story arc and does its job very well."

"*I will be talking about the Ultimate Edition of the film* This was one of the most anticipated CBM of all time. Ever since the arrival and subsequent success of Marvel's The Avengers people have wondered when will DC launch its own cinematic universe, one of the main reasons being the opportunity to finally see titans such as Batman and Superman share the screen together: the ultimate nerd dream. On 2016, the moment finally came for BvS to be released AND.. it performed poorly. Not only did critical reception left a lot to be desired, but fan reactions where surprisingly split after its cinematic debut. People either loved it and called Zack a genius, or hated it and called him a hack. Me, personally, I found myself with middle of the road feelings, for sure, but more leaning towards the negative side with subsequent viewings. The theatrical cut of the film showcased amazing performances, incredible visuals, and action set pieces that seemed like comic book panels come to life, in a good way. However, when it comes to its narrative structure and more technical aspects like editing, the film was seriously flawed. More plot holes than Age of Ultron, questionable character decisions, random editing that lacked cohesion and focus, and forced dramatic moments that lacked any impact because the attempts at character development ranged from limited to nonexistent, especially when it comes to Superman's character. I thought it was a 5/10 movie at best. As such, I was kind of skeptical about the idea of a 30 minute longer version. I say kind of because I know how Zack works. I remember Watchmen being vastly improved with its director's cut, so in a way I was expecting BvS to perform in a similar manner, but I also feared those 30 minutes wold be just there to amplify action and discredit storytelling issues. Oh boy, I'm so glad I was proved wrong. The ultimate cut of the film was infuriating, but not because it was awful, but because it questions the sanity of WB executives and editors and makes you wonder what were they thinking during the editing process. What I got out of the Ultimate Edition was a thought-provoking deconstruction of two very iconic superheroes that gave spotlight to the struggles both of them face when they aren't fighting crime. What I got was an extremely well produced character study on both Batman and Superman in a cynical world, a world dangerously close to our own. We meet Batman as a ruthless, worn out hero that has seen the failure behind his ideals and witnessed some truly horrifying things in his life. Superman, on the other hand, is portrayed as a godlike figure that seeks to do good in the world, but finds himself emotionally conflicted once he realized that every good deed he does leaves behind a trail of destruction (most of it due to Luthor's antics). In my opinion, this is a hugely original approach, one that distances itself from the rest of the competition and delivers a dark, somber, yet relevant superhero movie that understands both characters and gives them real human struggles to deal with. I felt invested in both of them, and hoped that by the end of the film both could find a way to redeem themselves. Their character arcs were very well established during the first two acts of the movie, and by the time we get to the titular climactic battle the emotion behind the jaw-dropping action is intensified. Lex Luthor as a villain was also given more time to develop with this new edition. One of the main criticisms with the original version was the fact that his plan relied too much on conveniences, and the character's mannerisms and mad-scientist attitude was annoying, and that goes without saying his motivations were unclear. Not only do we spend more time understanding his hate for any godlike figure and thus his hatred for Superman, but the added scenes allowed us to witness his entire plan come to fruition. It sells the cold, manipulative, calculating attributes of his comic counterpart. The acting is spot on. Every actor owns his/her role, from Cavill's Superman, to Ben Affleck as Batman, Eisenberg as Luthor, and Gadot as Wonder Woman, whose scenes are brief, but are more than enough to sell the strong and ferocious warrior that she is. Cinematography is stunning, and miles above that of Man of Steel's. And the soundtrack by Zimmer and Junkie XL? Perfect, just perfect. When it comes to flaws, the film still has some of those. The Martha moment, while serving as a pivotal character moment for Batman, felt off in execution, and its understandable that many people got mad at it. If your main complaint about BvS the first time around was its bleak tone and subject matter, this film is still not for you. I understand most were expecting to see the heroes being the most iconic versions of themselves, clashing in an elongated battle and evoking the same feelings The Avengers gave audiences back in 2012. In that sense, the film will remain divisive, but at least I have the comfort of saying that, at the very least, the film is competently made."

"This film was amazing. Ben Affleck was easily the best part of this movie, he brought his a-game as Batman. The chemistry between Affleck & Irons was outstanding. Gal Gadot did a great job as Wonder Woman. The fight between Batman & Superman was awesome. The final fight with Doomsday was outstanding in every way possible. However, there is only one problem with this film and that's Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor. He was sadly missed cast in this role, but then again it's really the fault of Warner Bros. Studios. Overall, this film deliver on almost every level. I highly recommend that you watch the extended version of this film."

"I know I know. I saw it in theaters too, and felt like it could've been so much better. While the Batman element was good, the narrative felt fractured, and the third act was just one long stunt scene. Superman was relegated to a supporting character, and other characters didn't get a chance to shine. And then I chanced on the ultimate cut. Calling it 30 mins of \"extra\" footage is unfair to Zack Snyder because it's exactly these 30 mins that makes the movie a worthy one. What I can say about the theatrical cut is this - It had the blockbuster elements - music, visuals, stunts, CGI. But, it lacked the human elements. The first 20 mins of the movie had it, but not after that. The extended cut in comparison has a flow to the narrative. There are no disjointed scenes, everything flows smoothly, and there's connective tissue. Superman gets to spend some time with his father, and mother. Clark Kent does some investigative journalism. Superman helps the people after the blast. Lois Lane doesn't jump to conclusions, she gets to the bottom of the crime. Lex Luthor apparently had a coherent plan - everything is explained pretty well. Wonder Woman was already good, so there's no change there :) Also, the \"Martha\" scene seems better executed, because it is a few seconds longer, and there's time to breathe it in. So, here's my take on this movie - The theatrical cut was junk. Get the Bluray for ultimate edition, and you shall not be disappointed. I've seen it so many more times now, and it's the definitive cut. It is the movie we deserve. It's a unique take on Batman, and Superman. It's a gritty take on the superhero movie genre, and definitely the best DCEU movie, and the best DC movie since The Dark Knight.P.S. Yes it's dark. We're adults, and we should appreciate mature film making without intentionally silly moments. It attempts to be philosophical, and something deep instead of just trying to make you chuckle."

"This is one of the best superhero movies ever made. Zack Snyder is a magician behind the camera.The reason behind so many complaints is the fact that Warner Bros. marketed this movie as a fight between Batman and Superman. That's not what it is. It's a movie about the origins of the Justice League.The cinematography, the acting and the score are all second to none. This film is phenomenal.P.S: watch the 3 hour extended cut that Snyder intended you to see, not the 2 and a half hour movie that Warner Bros. decided would be better for theaters."

"I don't care what the critics say, this is a very well-done movie. I'll start my review by listing what I like about the movie.1.) Ben Affleck is the best batman to me and it is not close. He pulls off the role of an aging batman extremely well. Also, Zack Snyder's vision of batman is legit. I have always hated batman up until this adaptation of him. Instead of being a conflicted and idealistic batman, this batman is dark, gritty, and 100% a badass. His equipment is decked out with machine guns and he has no aversion to killing people. In fact, he probably kills about 50 criminal by the time this movie is over. The warehouse scene is the coolest batman scene in any movie.2.) The development of a grudge between batman and superman is pulled off flawlessly. It actually makes sense why batman dislikes superman. Then, when they do fight it is about the coolest thing you can expect to see from a superhero film. 3.) I disagree with a lot of people about Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor. In my opinion, he played his role to perfection. 4.) B v S sets up Wonder Woman and Justice League with Gal Gadot's cameo as Wonder Woman and short clips of Aquaman, the Flash, and Cyborg. B v S is one of my favorite superhero films and rewatching it never gets old."

"The theatrical cut of this film is garbage which is why I rated it eight stars instead of nine. The first time I watched this film I didn't like it (not straight out hate but didn't like). Character motivations didn't make any sense, Lex was annoying as s***, editing was sloppy, and it was overly dark and broody for an action superhero movie. A year + a half, five Marvel films, a ton of bad reviews and a Justice League later a thought popped into my head: \"what if I watched BVS again\". This time I didn't have trailers ruining the best moments, I only vaguely remembered the film, and I was conditioned to look at it negatively but something unexpected happened: I actually loved it. Superman was just a normal person that tried to make a difference cause he could that others imposed their own beliefs on. Lex Luthor was a genius that couldn't stand his powerlessness compared to Superman or more accurately a super being. As Alfred said \"The fever, the rage, the feeling of powerlessness that turns good men... cruel\" and you see the same thought process in Batman. Batman, just like Lex Luthor feels powerless in the midst of a god-being and just like Lex he attempts to destroy him so he can get his sense of power back but unlike Lex, Batman learns something. I what is one of the corniest lines of the movie Superman says, \"Martha\" when he knows he can't win against Batman in a late desperate attempt to save his mother. Not only does this name connect with Bruce Wayne but it also shows what really matters to a man of steel: it isn't power, it isn't fame or anything else, it is his Mother and on a broader scale it is people. Lex (who doesn't care about people at all) knows he doesn't have the power so he creates something from his blood and the remains of Zod: A Doomsday for Superman. Not only does this film have depth but it also doesn't always explain it to you which is rare in a blockbuster action superhero flick normally cater to semi-comic book fans and people that want to shove popcorn in their mouths. This film rewards you for really noticing the details while still having massive explosions. One of my favorites is how Lex has all of Batman's branded killed which is why he isn't afraid of the branding at the end or Grandma's Peach Tea as a way of scaring the s*** out of someone. Of course, this film isn't perfect and I do have personal dislikes. The Batman V Superman fight was slow and pretty boring especially after watching such an amazing fight in Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 2 (If you haven't watched the animated Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 1 and 2 you are sorely missing out on something fantastic). Also, the addition of Wonder Woman who pretty much steals a hacker thing, gives it back and then suits up and fights against a giant monster thing. Not to say I don't like Wonder Woman (She is one of my favorite Superheroes of all time who showed not only can woman kick a** but they also don't need to be ashamed of their sexuality or gender) but she wasn't really that helpful to the plot and just brought in to expand the universe which was well done through Lex's superhuman hunting files. Also, the post-apocalyptic scene that was just a dream could have been cut but nothing is perfect except movies like Citizen Kane which isn't a lot of fun to watch cause it is too perfect. So to summarize, the theatrical cut is bad, the ultimate cut is Amazing and the other cut is meh. Please give it a second chance because it deserves it and save a good director from losing grace because of something he didn't do."
"I really liked it, don't know what all the hate is about. I'm actually a Marvel fan from when I was 7 or so, but Superman and Batman together in 1 movie? Just great. And personally I like Ben Affleck even better than Christian Bale as Batman. So just watch and enjoy, I know I did!"

"That's right. We have been waiting for these two heroes to finally meet and fight against each other. This movie is so good in both plot and special effects.Henry Cavill and Ben Affleck have performed well in their acting stages. They are the best superhero actors and they have filmed their fighting scenes very well. The movie starts to show the conflict between the lives of the heroes and now they have blamed each other for it. This movie is amazing and sets up a good plot for Dawn Justice."

"Actually...I didn't know what to expect. When you see Wonder Woman, you know it will be off of Wonder Woman and off of a Wonder Woman story, but with Batman V Superman, I was like, \"hmmmm, so who is this about?\" It was pretty obvious that it would feature many characters, but I thought the introduction to Batman was amazing. Ben Affleck nailed the part, not only as Batman but also as Bruce Wayne. He is my Batman. Henry Cavill continued to be super as the Man of Steel. And he is my Super - Man. A dark story? Yes, without a doubt. Could it have had a few more jokes? Sure. But not all movies or stories need to have jokes when certain events are serious. I really hope people can see this review and take another look at the movie, because, I loved it. I really hope the ratings can go up, eventually. And P.S, this movie is the perfect set up to Justice League."

"I'll start by making it clear I have only ever seen the Ultimate Edition. I'm aware of what was cut out for the theatrical release, so I will concede up front that most of the criticisms about pacing, editing, and missing bits of plot at release were merited.With that caveat out of the way, I must reiterate that this was bar-none the boldest superhero movie I have ever seen. To me, it was arguably the best as well, though \"best\" shouldn't be taken to mean \"most enjoyable.\" That honor easily goes to \"Thor: Ragnarok.\" What makes BvS stand out among other films in the genre is that it takes two characters who have been done to death since the 1970s and brings them up to date. I recently tried to watch \"Superman: The Movie\" for the first time in a number of years, and while it was still good and Reeves will always be iconic, I just couldn't take it seriously. I'll put it this way: If the story in BvS was \"stupid\" in your view but Superman turning back time by spinning the earth backward on its axis didn't seem like one of the dumbest things you have ever seen -in any movie from any genre- to the extent that it outright ruins the movie for you, then your opinion about BvS isn't worth much. Nostalgic bias was always going to be a problem for this movie, and the way people reacted to and reviewed \"Man of Steel\" was telling in this regard.That brings me to Zack Snyder's take on Superman. You know, that guy whose status as the first extraterrestrial ever encountered by humanity was a total non-issue in the old movies. Apparently, Snyder has a similar view to my own in that his take on the Man of Steel makes his being an alien a core piece of his identity. He may look like any other (absurdly attractive) person, but he knows what he is, and that makes him perpetually uncertain of where he fits in this world. He is essentially good and really does care about people, but he struggles to truly empathize with the likes of us. To be human is to be frail, and that is not something he can easily relate to. This is the root of his conflict with Batman.Just as Clark struggles to genuinely relate to most people, Snyder's Batman either refuses to or otherwise just can't relate to Superman. He doesn't see him as anything but a threat regardless of Superman's clear good intentions. Remember, a small group of Kryptonians were able to bring humanity to the brink of extinction in less than a day, and Bruce Wayne is nothing if not a realist. He didn't know the guy from Kansas. He only knew the god from another world.While Batman's anger toward and fear of Superman are readily apparent from the start, Superman's inability to imagine things from Bruce Wayne's perspective only becomes truly apparent during their first real interaction. This reminded me of the animated version of the \"world's finest\" storyline, where Superman judges Batman harshly for using fear tactics and threats of violence (also, actual violence) to get the job done. Superman wasn't willing to consider what it would take for a human man to fight criminals and save innocents, or what that life would do to him over time. Just as Batman didn't see the guy from Kansas, Superman didn't see the man who lives his life trapped in one brutal, unthinkably traumatic moment (this was beautifully conveyed during the film's opening moments), and had spent his whole adult life bearing witness to humanity at its absolute worst.The conflict between these two characters is as old as human history. They want the same things, but they can't understand one another. So they fight. And what a fight it was.Watching a fight between, say, Captain America and Iron Man was, to me, more frustrating than anything because each understood the other's perspective perfectly. The fight between Batman and Superman in BvS was genuinely gut-wrenching, as intended, because they would have understood one another if either had tried. The whole sequence hilighted Batman's tactical prowess and ability to control a situation. Maybe the most badass thing about the fight was that it ended exactly where Batman planned. That brings me to the big elephant in the room named \"Martha.\"I can't recall exactly which YouTuber put it this way, but if you thought the \"save Martha\" exchange was about their mothers having the same name, you had your brain turned off. The brain-on people have explained this to death, but it bears repeating. This was the moment when Superman became humanized to Batman. He was about to die, and his only concern was for his adoptive human mother. He still believed that the man about to take his life would do the right thing. Even with the cowl on, there was no mistaking the look on Batman's face. It was the look of shame, guilt, and sudden uncertainty that says \"What am I doing?\" Turns out even the most brutal, angry version of Bruce Wayne is better than Tony Stark at knowing right from wrong. At knowing that he had gone too far.From there, the third act was a series of truly impressive (albeit mostly CGI) fight sequences, beginning with what I regard as the undisputed champion of Batman fights. Nothing in the Nolan movies (and especially nothing in the Burton movies) even came close. Go ahead, try to convince yourself that Batman and Bane taking turns punching one another in the face until Bane's mask broke was a good fight sequence. No, this was a fight straight out of \"Arkham Knight,\" and it was glorious. The battle against Doomsday really was one for the books. From the moment Wonder Woman arrived accompanied by the intense sounds of Tina Guo's electric cello to Superman's tragic, heroic death at the hands of Doomsday, I was glued to the screen. Sure, the mere presence of Doomsday spoiled the end to a degree, but watching the Man of Steel laboring to carry that kryptonite spear towards certain death was no less impactful. A brief word on Jesse Eisenberg's take on Lex Luthor. At least one other reviewer on this site already said it best when they pointed out that this was his origin story. If you consider his scheme objectively, he is actually one of the more formidable incarnations of the character. If we're lucky, we'll eventually get to see a Snyder Cut of \"Justice League\" and find out where this story was actually meant to go. For the record, Joss Whedon and Danny Elfman both should have said \"no\" to taking a dump on someone else's art."
"BATMAN V SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE brings a fantastic surprise to a smash-hit team-up with one of the worlds most beloved DC Comics' icons of all time. The movie delivers spectacular casting, and fantastic acting with different characters having their shine in each scenes.The story follows Clark Kent/Superman who becomes a threat, after the destruction in Metropolis in Man Of Steel.(2013). Batman/Bruce Wayne sees him as a threat and begins his war on Superman.The movie brings spectacular storytelling, it tells the complications of human against alien who are on the same side, and the first meeting of Batman and Superman. The story of Bruce Wayne, with his many years of The Caped Crusader, sends him on a spiral of \"out of control\", sheer anger, and builds tension to wanting to defeat the Man of Steel. Snyder has fantastically gave this storytelling an exciting nod to the comics.Lex Luthor, played by Jesse Einsberg, delivers a very interesting performance, but very differently by him showing is his \"origin\" before he becomes a bald foe to the Man of Steel. He shows that his love of \"god vs man\" terrorises mankind when he ultimately creates Doomsday, and Batman realises Superman's inner heroism.It packs so many great \"out of nowhere\" excitement, including a first-look of the fearful Wonder Woman a.k.a. Diana Prince, played by Gal Gadot, and a fresh-new glimpse of the superhero DC canon: The Justice League.WATCH THIS MOVIE! The critics are out of their mind. It's a fun-packed action adventure which still keeps the movie enjoyable until it's final minutes of the movie. It's a FANTASTIC MOVIE! BEN AFFLECK AS BATMAN... is Incredible!A 10/10 overall!"
"I want to go on record as saying that this is a truly thrilling cinematic experience in so many ways. If pressed, I guess I could acknowledge that there were a couple ... let's say \"clumsy\" moments. And in a film that runs to three hours, that hardly seems like a significant issue, certainly not enough to rate it with fewer than 9 stars.This film has everything. There is dramatic tension right from the start. There is a magnificent story arc that picks up quite seamlessly from 'Man of Steel' and propels the viewer not only into the life of Clark Kent/Superman but also of Bruce Wayne/Batman.The villain is no mere cartoon of a villain; he is truly thoroughly (and apparently irrevocably) diabolical. He is a psychopath, and you wish for his death over and over and over. You want Superman to reduce him to ash with the power of his eyes.I have read a number of viewers' reviews, and it seems that the people who disliked the film / gave it a low rating had rather unfair and unrealistic expectations of it. That is, their own prejudices about how the plot could/should unfold or what the character development could/should be, etc. ruined the film for them. And that is a shame.My thought is: I settle into my seat, wait for the lights to dim, and then I wait to be transported by the film. I accept it, lock, stock, and barrel.As another reviewer remarked, I love how the film begins from the point of view of Bruce Wayne as he is among people on the ground who have fallen victim to the attack of Zod and the other Kryptonians.Why would Bruce Wayne not like Superman? Why would the good people of Earth hurl insults at Superman and burn him in effigy (on the news)? Because the good people of Earth just got catapulted into a new reality in which there are not only extraterrestrial beings (surprise!) but they are also superman! And a group of them are hell-bent on destroying humankind and taking the planet for themselves.It is difficult to see Superman as separate from the whole Kryptonian Krew.It seems that many moviegoers forgot that Bruce Wayne is also human. Sure, he's a hero, but he is flawed.. Just like the rest of us. He is a vigilante, after all.He has let his vigilantism get the better of him. HE is actually the one working outside the boundaries of the law, not Superman. It is the clear head of Alfred that shows us that he has gone into a rather dark place, that he has not seen what is really going on (in Luthor's scheme), and so he chooses to embark on his own scheme scheme to take out the alien invader. He is (allegedly) thinking of the future: if he wipes out the all-powerful alien, then it can't turn on humankind in the future. At least, he convinces himself of that.A philosophical question is raised in the film: should Clark Kent have remained a simple man from Kansas and never have become the Superman? Should he just let people die and let calamities happen? The question is answered for us in the character of Diana Prince/Wonder Woman. She withdrew from mankind (her exact words) and just sat around watching. Watching while people died horrible deaths all around her. So, should Superman have done the same? Do these special beings, these 'metahumans', have some kind of moral imperative to intervene, or should they be allowed to be regular people, too? It seems that humans want it both ways.It seems that humans are saying: \"Don't be a superalien ... except when I and my friends and family are in trouble. Then come save us.\""

"Batman v Superman: Ultimate Edition: If your looking for a quick, cheap thrill then you might not enjoy this film at the time. This movies theatrical version was butchered by WB and in doing so reshaped the story leaving numerous plot holes. So the Ultimate Edition is the full story and the one worth seeing. Watch 'Man of Steel' before seeing this movie. There is much to claw through here, so much so that the audience might easily find themselves exhausted from the overall aggression of the film. However, a lot of the story does work. The action is good, and the emotion feels real most of the time.This film is about Superman trying to become Superman. Trying to help the world, save people, find a place in this world not as an outcast, and yet is looked at has a threat by many. Superman is not from this world, yet He is trying to be human, find a place in this world, be excepted by earths people, and come into his destiny.This film is also about Batman being Batman for 20 years and losing faith in humanity, and fearing Superman, what Superman can do with his powers. Great film, great plot, great visuals. ---Yidioo"
"I didn't see the film in the theaters and just bought the \"Extended Edition \" on Amazon. I never properly saw Man of Steel- i think I rented it and watched it when already exhausted and fell asleep. I saw the mediocre user reviews and horrible reviews from critics of this film.They really have it wrong. This is the very best either Batman or Superman. It has a different take, on things. Much darker then earlier films even darker then the Christopher Nolan Batman films.First of all Christopher Nolan is an Executive Producer. So how bad could it be? I loved Sucker Punch and Zack Snyder was involved with that. So how bad could this be? Hans Zimmer did the music, so how bad could it be?I remember watching the old Superman TV shows and reading the Superman and Batman comics as a little kid and loved them, but i wouldn't call myself a \"fan boy\" of comic universes, like so many younger people today. As an older adult I will admit my favorite TV show of all time was Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but watched it on DVD only after it had finished. I saw the second of the Dark Knight series in the theater, but the other two, I watched on DVD. They were great, but not my favorite films like so many people. i also loved the first couple Superman and Batman films in the older series. Regardless, i was not waiting with baited breath to see Man of Steel or this one.I'm more of a serious film fan, who can watch Stanley Kubrick films over and over and my favorite films in the last twenty years, are Eyes Wide Shut and Intersteller, both of which i've watched multiple times.So, with that said, take it from me, the critics have this film very wrong, just as critics hated 2001: A Space Odyssey when it first came out. This film will have lasting appreciation.Surprised how much I liked Ben Afleck's Batman. it was hard to get into Henry Cavil's scrawnier looking Superman, but it grew on me. Amy Adams was great as Lois Lane, The Gal Gadol Wonder Women was amazing. Lex Luther was terrific, like Nolan's Joker. Jeremy Irons was the best Alfred ever. Holly Hunter and Diane Lane was good too. The movie had bad reviews but made a billion dollars. Hopefully everyone buys the Ultimate Edition and it breaks sales records and the film is re-appreciated. I have no idea what scenes this Ultimate Edition added, but it is pretty perfect. Now I can't wait for Wonder Woman and the Justice League and as soon as I finish writing this am going to watch Man of Steal. I'm into it now!I can only surmise that the bad reviews stem from too much expectations of the rigid fan boy types and the radical changes in tone, we see in this film.Total masterpiece of cinema, but I have a few criticisms. There are a few hollow scenes of typical Idiot cops and authorities getting everything wrong in a cliché type way and it has a few filler scenes of that type and a few moments here and there that felt rushed and cheesy. Maybe not everything restored into the Ultimate Edition should have been. I wish there had been more Kevin Costner scenes."

"The whole entire Batman V Superman movie was great and yes even though it felt slow to the majority of the people who watched it but to me I enjoyed every part and every scene of Batman V Superman and when it got to the fight scenes both batman VS Superman and the Doomsday fight it brought so much drama, intensity, and epic performances. So with that being said I give this movie a good 10/10 because it really did go to my expectations and it brought a powerful performance and a powerful yet epic introduction to the upcoming Justice League."

"When I first wrote a review for this movie a year ago exclaiming my excitement for the film, I had been high off a fresh dose of live-action DC superheroes playing out the beloved comic book stories that I had grown up on. It was all playing out before my eyes and coming to life. After a few months had passed, I began to notice things about the movie that I disliked: little gaps in the story, things that didn't add up, etc. My original rating of a 10 / 10 dropped to an 8 /10. But today it has gone back up to a 10. The extended version of the film not only rectifies the gaps but also silences critics.Many claimed that the movie was too dark or that it just didn't make sense. To those people, I say: \"Pick up a comic book!\" Many of the critics of this particular film were part of the superhero bandwagon that formed when Marvel began its spree of Avengers-related films. In fact, its estimated that over 60% of people who go to see 'superhero' genre films have never picked up a comic book in their life. I would argue that similar numbers could figure to those which view the CW televised DC Universe shows. People complain that DC comics is just too dark but the fact is that these movies are based upon actual comics which are meant to be dark (ex: The Dark Knight Returns, Injustice, etc.). Its like complaining that Game of Thrones (the TV series) sucks because they kill off too many characters. Read the books! Its frustrating to see such a beautiful work of art like Batman V Superman criticized by those ignorant to its universe and its meaning. This movie is in fact a catalyst that opens numerous doorways and leaves true fans in awe of the possibilities for future movies. But regardless of whether or not people choose to educate themselves, this film's DVD/Blu-ray extended version puts the theater release to shame. All of the plot holes and gaps are filled in 30 minutes of extended footage scattered throughout the film. The movie ultimately becomes more complete and people will wish that the movie had shown the full 3 hours of footage in its theatrical debut. As a major DC comics fan, I will of course pick up on things that a comics fan would not, but someone who does not read comics would learn to appreciate this film in its entirety with the extended version. Get your hands on a copy today or find it on Netflix or the internet somewhere!"

"I ignored the bad reviews and watched anyways. This film had a lot to live up to after Civil War was released and I went into this film expecting the worst. It ended up to be the best Superhero film of 2016 to me. One complaint was that this film was more concerned about universe building than telling a great story than Civil War but for me it was the other way around; Civil War felt like a build up to something else and to be honest, I felt that way when I saw the other MCU films. Batman vs Superman however not only had a great story, but it also felt a lot more consistent than Civil War. This film was way more diverse with the cast than the MCU but unlike the MCU, I felt like this film doesn't go overboard with the SJW stuff like the MCU films or The Star Wars Sequel films do. The Visuals were AMAZING, The Score by Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL was AMAZING as well, The Tone is just right as I actually felt for the characters emotionally, The Cinematography kept my eyes glued to the screen, and the script felt really Intelligent and Complex and despite people calling the writing confusing, I was able to piece it together with no problem whatsoever. This film is similar to Empire Strikes back in terms of popularity so over time after the other movies are released, this movie would probably be more popular.This film was way better than I Expected and deserves another chance.

"Its shame to see what critics and marvel fans did to this movie and targeted Zack Snyder for it. I have seen this movie more than 25 times till date. And i enjoy this movie as much as i enjoyed the first time. The fans who have read DC comics, wouldn't be disappointed in this movie. Its dark movie, yes it is. Because the title shows the intense situation at hand. Two superheroes about to rip each other apart for whatever reasons that brought them to this stage. Yes it had to be dark and intense.Only marvel can be stupid enough to show an alien invasion where humans are loosing the battle and the super heroes are cracking jokes while battles as if they are playing ping pong. a person playing Call of Duty game is more serious while playing than the marvel heroes fighting aliens."

"Last week some news came out from somebody online who had claimed to have seen a finished version of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. If you were like me, you've been leery of checking it out because you weren't sure how much might actually be true. Now Zack Snyder has spoken out about the spoiler-filled post, although his response doesn't really clear anything up.In a word, to MTV, he called the post \"hilarious,which might imply that he's saying that it's mostly, if not entirely, untrue. That might be the case, but then again he could have just said it was untrue and he didn't say that. What he did say, however, is that he doesn't like spoilers. While this may seem odd for the director who's most recent trailer appeared to give away the entire movie, Snyder says that's not the case. Even if you've seen the trailer, you can rest easy, as there is much more we have not seen in then finished film. Says Snyder I have the benefit of seeing the movie. It's cool that think it's too much, and I appreciate people not wanting to know, but there's plenty that they don't know. There's a lot of movie that's not in the trailer. In the process of calling the Batman v Superman Reddit review hilarious, Snyder goes on to talk about how he hates it when spoilers come out. The director would much rather that fans see the movie mostly blind. While he understands that some fans may wish to find the answers before hand, he wants his movies to be mysteries going in. If you're, as an audience member, exploring these articles, looking for answers to questions that you have, maybe you're okay with knowing before you go. It's like an individual taste. But like I said, I want people to see the movie without knowing.Spoilers are a topic that mean different things to different people. While most try to avoid them to some degree, the need to solve the mystery is a nearly universal human experience. We have an inclination to want to know the truth, even while also wanting to be surprised. For most of us getting some information is good, but getting all the information is bad, of course, only getting the details that you want can be difficult."
"The theatrical is choppy, poorly edited, hard to follow, with some really good moments mixed in their. The extended is much more fluent and is much easier to follow, it does have a long runtime, which might make it seem a bit dragging on, but if you like long films done right, like Lord of the Rings, you will like this movie as long as you get into the characters and story. Speaking of which, the story starts out perfectly showing Bruce Wayne as a character, and it is very powerful. There are several moments in this movie that are powerful, emotional, and shocking. Characters. Batman is my favorite fictional character of all time, and believe me when I say, Ben Affleck as Batman was perfect, he had the charisma, the anger, and the look of being through some bad stuff Gal Gadot also does perfect as Wonder Woman, but if you want to really see how good she does, go watch the Wonder Woman movie. Henry Call as Superman. I really don't like it when people say Christopher Reeves is better. Don't get me wrong, Reeves does great, but can you imagine him as Superman in this movie? I wouldn't like it. It would be like Adam West playing Batman in The Dark Knight. Henry Cavill does great in this role, I can say everything about him as I said with Ben Affleck. Jesse Eisenberg as Luthor. I thought it was different in a good way. I've heard a criticism for him as being too much like Joker, but is that a bad thing? Joker is my favorite villain, so to see Superman have an enemy that crazy, but still hold the values Luthor needs to be Luthor, I think it is great. The thing I thought this movie was lacking in the first and second acts was humor, at least good humor. If there was more humor, I would've given this movie a ten because it would give a more relaxing feel to the parts that needed it. All in all though, this movie was awesome, it had powerful moments, it was badass, and just plain fun. It had a great story arc and does its job very well."

"*I will be talking about the Ultimate Edition of the film* This was one of the most anticipated CBM of all time. Ever since the arrival and subsequent success of Marvel's The Avengers people have wondered when will DC launch its own cinematic universe, one of the main reasons being the opportunity to finally see titans such as Batman and Superman share the screen together: the ultimate nerd dream. On 2016, the moment finally came for BvS to be released AND.. it performed poorly. Not only did critical reception left a lot to be desired, but fan reactions where surprisingly split after its cinematic debut. People either loved it and called Zack a genius, or hated it and called him a hack. Me, personally, I found myself with middle of the road feelings, for sure, but more leaning towards the negative side with subsequent viewings. The theatrical cut of the film showcased amazing performances, incredible visuals, and action set pieces that seemed like comic book panels come to life, in a good way. However, when it comes to its narrative structure and more technical aspects like editing, the film was seriously flawed. More plot holes than Age of Ultron, questionable character decisions, random editing that lacked cohesion and focus, and forced dramatic moments that lacked any impact because the attempts at character development ranged from limited to nonexistent, especially when it comes to Superman's character. I thought it was a 5/10 movie at best. As such, I was kind of skeptical about the idea of a 30 minute longer version. I say kind of because I know how Zack works. I remember Watchmen being vastly improved with its director's cut, so in a way I was expecting BvS to perform in a similar manner, but I also feared those 30 minutes wold be just there to amplify action and discredit storytelling issues. Oh boy, I'm so glad I was proved wrong. The ultimate cut of the film was infuriating, but not because it was awful, but because it questions the sanity of WB executives and editors and makes you wonder what were they thinking during the editing process. What I got out of the Ultimate Edition was a thought-provoking deconstruction of two very iconic superheroes that gave spotlight to the struggles both of them face when they aren't fighting crime. What I got was an extremely well produced character study on both Batman and Superman in a cynical world, a world dangerously close to our own. We meet Batman as a ruthless, worn out hero that has seen the failure behind his ideals and witnessed some truly horrifying things in his life. Superman, on the other hand, is portrayed as a godlike figure that seeks to do good in the world, but finds himself emotionally conflicted once he realized that every good deed he does leaves behind a trail of destruction (most of it due to Luthor's antics). In my opinion, this is a hugely original approach, one that distances itself from the rest of the competition and delivers a dark, somber, yet relevant superhero movie that understands both characters and gives them real human struggles to deal with. I felt invested in both of them, and hoped that by the end of the film both could find a way to redeem themselves. Their character arcs were very well established during the first two acts of the movie, and by the time we get to the titular climactic battle the emotion behind the jaw-dropping action is intensified. Lex Luthor as a villain was also given more time to develop with this new edition. One of the main criticisms with the original version was the fact that his plan relied too much on conveniences, and the character's mannerisms and mad-scientist attitude was annoying, and that goes without saying his motivations were unclear. Not only do we spend more time understanding his hate for any godlike figure and thus his hatred for Superman, but the added scenes allowed us to witness his entire plan come to fruition. It sells the cold, manipulative, calculating attributes of his comic counterpart. The acting is spot on. Every actor owns his/her role, from Cavill's Superman, to Ben Affleck as Batman, Eisenberg as Luthor, and Gadot as Wonder Woman, whose scenes are brief, but are more than enough to sell the strong and ferocious warrior that she is. Cinematography is stunning, and miles above that of Man of Steel's. And the soundtrack by Zimmer and Junkie XL? Perfect, just perfect. When it comes to flaws, the film still has some of those. The Martha moment, while serving as a pivotal character moment for Batman, felt off in execution, and its understandable that many people got mad at it. If your main complaint about BvS the first time around was its bleak tone and subject matter, this film is still not for you. I understand most were expecting to see the heroes being the most iconic versions of themselves, clashing in an elongated battle and evoking the same feelings The Avengers gave audiences back in 2012. In that sense, the film will remain divisive, but at least I have the comfort of saying that, at the very least, the film is competently made."

"This film was amazing. Ben Affleck was easily the best part of this movie, he brought his a-game as Batman. The chemistry between Affleck & Irons was outstanding. Gal Gadot did a great job as Wonder Woman. The fight between Batman & Superman was awesome. The final fight with Doomsday was outstanding in every way possible. However, there is only one problem with this film and that's Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor. He was sadly missed cast in this role, but then again it's really the fault of Warner Bros. Studios. Overall, this film deliver on almost every level. I highly recommend that you watch the extended version of this film."

"I know I know. I saw it in theaters too, and felt like it could've been so much better. While the Batman element was good, the narrative felt fractured, and the third act was just one long stunt scene. Superman was relegated to a supporting character, and other characters didn't get a chance to shine. And then I chanced on the ultimate cut. Calling it 30 mins of \"extra\" footage is unfair to Zack Snyder because it's exactly these 30 mins that makes the movie a worthy one. What I can say about the theatrical cut is this - It had the blockbuster elements - music, visuals, stunts, CGI. But, it lacked the human elements. The first 20 mins of the movie had it, but not after that. The extended cut in comparison has a flow to the narrative. There are no disjointed scenes, everything flows smoothly, and there's connective tissue. Superman gets to spend some time with his father, and mother. Clark Kent does some investigative journalism. Superman helps the people after the blast. Lois Lane doesn't jump to conclusions, she gets to the bottom of the crime. Lex Luthor apparently had a coherent plan - everything is explained pretty well. Wonder Woman was already good, so there's no change there :) Also, the \"Martha\" scene seems better executed, because it is a few seconds longer, and there's time to breathe it in. So, here's my take on this movie - The theatrical cut was junk. Get the Bluray for ultimate edition, and you shall not be disappointed. I've seen it so many more times now, and it's the definitive cut. It is the movie we deserve. It's a unique take on Batman, and Superman. It's a gritty take on the superhero movie genre, and definitely the best DCEU movie, and the best DC movie since The Dark Knight.P.S. Yes it's dark. We're adults, and we should appreciate mature film making without intentionally silly moments. It attempts to be philosophical, and something deep instead of just trying to make you chuckle."

"This is one of the best superhero movies ever made. Zack Snyder is a magician behind the camera.The reason behind so many complaints is the fact that Warner Bros. marketed this movie as a fight between Batman and Superman. That's not what it is. It's a movie about the origins of the Justice League.The cinematography, the acting and the score are all second to none. This film is phenomenal.P.S: watch the 3 hour extended cut that Snyder intended you to see, not the 2 and a half hour movie that Warner Bros. decided would be better for theaters."

"I don't care what the critics say, this is a very well-done movie. I'll start my review by listing what I like about the movie.1.) Ben Affleck is the best batman to me and it is not close. He pulls off the role of an aging batman extremely well. Also, Zack Snyder's vision of batman is legit. I have always hated batman up until this adaptation of him. Instead of being a conflicted and idealistic batman, this batman is dark, gritty, and 100% a badass. His equipment is decked out with machine guns and he has no aversion to killing people. In fact, he probably kills about 50 criminal by the time this movie is over. The warehouse scene is the coolest batman scene in any movie.2.) The development of a grudge between batman and superman is pulled off flawlessly. It actually makes sense why batman dislikes superman. Then, when they do fight it is about the coolest thing you can expect to see from a superhero film. 3.) I disagree with a lot of people about Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor. In my opinion, he played his role to perfection. 4.) B v S sets up Wonder Woman and Justice League with Gal Gadot's cameo as Wonder Woman and short clips of Aquaman, the Flash, and Cyborg. B v S is one of my favorite superhero films and rewatching it never gets old."

"The theatrical cut of this film is garbage which is why I rated it eight stars instead of nine. The first time I watched this film I didn't like it (not straight out hate but didn't like). Character motivations didn't make any sense, Lex was annoying as s***, editing was sloppy, and it was overly dark and broody for an action superhero movie. A year + a half, five Marvel films, a ton of bad reviews and a Justice League later a thought popped into my head: \"what if I watched BVS again\". This time I didn't have trailers ruining the best moments, I only vaguely remembered the film, and I was conditioned to look at it negatively but something unexpected happened: I actually loved it. Superman was just a normal person that tried to make a difference cause he could that others imposed their own beliefs on. Lex Luthor was a genius that couldn't stand his powerlessness compared to Superman or more accurately a super being. As Alfred said \"The fever, the rage, the feeling of powerlessness that turns good men... cruel\" and you see the same thought process in Batman. Batman, just like Lex Luthor feels powerless in the midst of a god-being and just like Lex he attempts to destroy him so he can get his sense of power back but unlike Lex, Batman learns something. I what is one of the corniest lines of the movie Superman says, \"Martha\" when he knows he can't win against Batman in a late desperate attempt to save his mother. Not only does this name connect with Bruce Wayne but it also shows what really matters to a man of steel: it isn't power, it isn't fame or anything else, it is his Mother and on a broader scale it is people. Lex (who doesn't care about people at all) knows he doesn't have the power so he creates something from his blood and the remains of Zod: A Doomsday for Superman. Not only does this film have depth but it also doesn't always explain it to you which is rare in a blockbuster action superhero flick normally cater to semi-comic book fans and people that want to shove popcorn in their mouths. This film rewards you for really noticing the details while still having massive explosions. One of my favorites is how Lex has all of Batman's branded killed which is why he isn't afraid of the branding at the end or Grandma's Peach Tea as a way of scaring the s*** out of someone. Of course, this film isn't perfect and I do have personal dislikes. The Batman V Superman fight was slow and pretty boring especially after watching such an amazing fight in Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 2 (If you haven't watched the animated Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 1 and 2 you are sorely missing out on something fantastic). Also, the addition of Wonder Woman who pretty much steals a hacker thing, gives it back and then suits up and fights against a giant monster thing. Not to say I don't like Wonder Woman (She is one of my favorite Superheroes of all time who showed not only can woman kick a** but they also don't need to be ashamed of their sexuality or gender) but she wasn't really that helpful to the plot and just brought in to expand the universe which was well done through Lex's superhuman hunting files. Also, the post-apocalyptic scene that was just a dream could have been cut but nothing is perfect except movies like Citizen Kane which isn't a lot of fun to watch cause it is too perfect. So to summarize, the theatrical cut is bad, the ultimate cut is Amazing and the other cut is meh. Please give it a second chance because it deserves it and save a good director from losing grace because of something he didn't do."
"I really liked it, don't know what all the hate is about. I'm actually a Marvel fan from when I was 7 or so, but Superman and Batman together in 1 movie? Just great. And personally I like Ben Affleck even better than Christian Bale as Batman. So just watch and enjoy, I know I did!"

"That's right. We have been waiting for these two heroes to finally meet and fight against each other. This movie is so good in both plot and special effects.Henry Cavill and Ben Affleck have performed well in their acting stages. They are the best superhero actors and they have filmed their fighting scenes very well. The movie starts to show the conflict between the lives of the heroes and now they have blamed each other for it. This movie is amazing and sets up a good plot for Dawn Justice."

"Actually...I didn't know what to expect. When you see Wonder Woman, you know it will be off of Wonder Woman and off of a Wonder Woman story, but with Batman V Superman, I was like, \"hmmmm, so who is this about?\" It was pretty obvious that it would feature many characters, but I thought the introduction to Batman was amazing. Ben Affleck nailed the part, not only as Batman but also as Bruce Wayne. He is my Batman. Henry Cavill continued to be super as the Man of Steel. And he is my Super - Man. A dark story? Yes, without a doubt. Could it have had a few more jokes? Sure. But not all movies or stories need to have jokes when certain events are serious. I really hope people can see this review and take another look at the movie, because, I loved it. I really hope the ratings can go up, eventually. And P.S, this movie is the perfect set up to Justice League."

"I'll start by making it clear I have only ever seen the Ultimate Edition. I'm aware of what was cut out for the theatrical release, so I will concede up front that most of the criticisms about pacing, editing, and missing bits of plot at release were merited.With that caveat out of the way, I must reiterate that this was bar-none the boldest superhero movie I have ever seen. To me, it was arguably the best as well, though \"best\" shouldn't be taken to mean \"most enjoyable.\" That honor easily goes to \"Thor: Ragnarok.\" What makes BvS stand out among other films in the genre is that it takes two characters who have been done to death since the 1970s and brings them up to date. I recently tried to watch \"Superman: The Movie\" for the first time in a number of years, and while it was still good and Reeves will always be iconic, I just couldn't take it seriously. I'll put it this way: If the story in BvS was \"stupid\" in your view but Superman turning back time by spinning the earth backward on its axis didn't seem like one of the dumbest things you have ever seen -in any movie from any genre- to the extent that it outright ruins the movie for you, then your opinion about BvS isn't worth much. Nostalgic bias was always going to be a problem for this movie, and the way people reacted to and reviewed \"Man of Steel\" was telling in this regard.That brings me to Zack Snyder's take on Superman. You know, that guy whose status as the first extraterrestrial ever encountered by humanity was a total non-issue in the old movies. Apparently, Snyder has a similar view to my own in that his take on the Man of Steel makes his being an alien a core piece of his identity. He may look like any other (absurdly attractive) person, but he knows what he is, and that makes him perpetually uncertain of where he fits in this world. He is essentially good and really does care about people, but he struggles to truly empathize with the likes of us. To be human is to be frail, and that is not something he can easily relate to. This is the root of his conflict with Batman.Just as Clark struggles to genuinely relate to most people, Snyder's Batman either refuses to or otherwise just can't relate to Superman. He doesn't see him as anything but a threat regardless of Superman's clear good intentions. Remember, a small group of Kryptonians were able to bring humanity to the brink of extinction in less than a day, and Bruce Wayne is nothing if not a realist. He didn't know the guy from Kansas. He only knew the god from another world.While Batman's anger toward and fear of Superman are readily apparent from the start, Superman's inability to imagine things from Bruce Wayne's perspective only becomes truly apparent during their first real interaction. This reminded me of the animated version of the \"world's finest\" storyline, where Superman judges Batman harshly for using fear tactics and threats of violence (also, actual violence) to get the job done. Superman wasn't willing to consider what it would take for a human man to fight criminals and save innocents, or what that life would do to him over time. Just as Batman didn't see the guy from Kansas, Superman didn't see the man who lives his life trapped in one brutal, unthinkably traumatic moment (this was beautifully conveyed during the film's opening moments), and had spent his whole adult life bearing witness to humanity at its absolute worst.The conflict between these two characters is as old as human history. They want the same things, but they can't understand one another. So they fight. And what a fight it was.Watching a fight between, say, Captain America and Iron Man was, to me, more frustrating than anything because each understood the other's perspective perfectly. The fight between Batman and Superman in BvS was genuinely gut-wrenching, as intended, because they would have understood one another if either had tried. The whole sequence hilighted Batman's tactical prowess and ability to control a situation. Maybe the most badass thing about the fight was that it ended exactly where Batman planned. That brings me to the big elephant in the room named \"Martha.\"I can't recall exactly which YouTuber put it this way, but if you thought the \"save Martha\" exchange was about their mothers having the same name, you had your brain turned off. The brain-on people have explained this to death, but it bears repeating. This was the moment when Superman became humanized to Batman. He was about to die, and his only concern was for his adoptive human mother. He still believed that the man about to take his life would do the right thing. Even with the cowl on, there was no mistaking the look on Batman's face. It was the look of shame, guilt, and sudden uncertainty that says \"What am I doing?\" Turns out even the most brutal, angry version of Bruce Wayne is better than Tony Stark at knowing right from wrong. At knowing that he had gone too far.From there, the third act was a series of truly impressive (albeit mostly CGI) fight sequences, beginning with what I regard as the undisputed champion of Batman fights. Nothing in the Nolan movies (and especially nothing in the Burton movies) even came close. Go ahead, try to convince yourself that Batman and Bane taking turns punching one another in the face until Bane's mask broke was a good fight sequence. No, this was a fight straight out of \"Arkham Knight,\" and it was glorious. The battle against Doomsday really was one for the books. From the moment Wonder Woman arrived accompanied by the intense sounds of Tina Guo's electric cello to Superman's tragic, heroic death at the hands of Doomsday, I was glued to the screen. Sure, the mere presence of Doomsday spoiled the end to a degree, but watching the Man of Steel laboring to carry that kryptonite spear towards certain death was no less impactful. A brief word on Jesse Eisenberg's take on Lex Luthor. At least one other reviewer on this site already said it best when they pointed out that this was his origin story. If you consider his scheme objectively, he is actually one of the more formidable incarnations of the character. If we're lucky, we'll eventually get to see a Snyder Cut of \"Justice League\" and find out where this story was actually meant to go. For the record, Joss Whedon and Danny Elfman both should have said \"no\" to taking a dump on someone else's art."
"BATMAN V SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE brings a fantastic surprise to a smash-hit team-up with one of the worlds most beloved DC Comics' icons of all time. The movie delivers spectacular casting, and fantastic acting with different characters having their shine in each scenes.The story follows Clark Kent/Superman who becomes a threat, after the destruction in Metropolis in Man Of Steel.(2013). Batman/Bruce Wayne sees him as a threat and begins his war on Superman.The movie brings spectacular storytelling, it tells the complications of human against alien who are on the same side, and the first meeting of Batman and Superman. The story of Bruce Wayne, with his many years of The Caped Crusader, sends him on a spiral of \"out of control\", sheer anger, and builds tension to wanting to defeat the Man of Steel. Snyder has fantastically gave this storytelling an exciting nod to the comics.Lex Luthor, played by Jesse Einsberg, delivers a very interesting performance, but very differently by him showing is his \"origin\" before he becomes a bald foe to the Man of Steel. He shows that his love of \"god vs man\" terrorises mankind when he ultimately creates Doomsday, and Batman realises Superman's inner heroism.It packs so many great \"out of nowhere\" excitement, including a first-look of the fearful Wonder Woman a.k.a. Diana Prince, played by Gal Gadot, and a fresh-new glimpse of the superhero DC canon: The Justice League.WATCH THIS MOVIE! The critics are out of their mind. It's a fun-packed action adventure which still keeps the movie enjoyable until it's final minutes of the movie. It's a FANTASTIC MOVIE! BEN AFFLECK AS BATMAN... is Incredible!A 10/10 overall!"
"I want to go on record as saying that this is a truly thrilling cinematic experience in so many ways. If pressed, I guess I could acknowledge that there were a couple ... let's say \"clumsy\" moments. And in a film that runs to three hours, that hardly seems like a significant issue, certainly not enough to rate it with fewer than 9 stars.This film has everything. There is dramatic tension right from the start. There is a magnificent story arc that picks up quite seamlessly from 'Man of Steel' and propels the viewer not only into the life of Clark Kent/Superman but also of Bruce Wayne/Batman.The villain is no mere cartoon of a villain; he is truly thoroughly (and apparently irrevocably) diabolical. He is a psychopath, and you wish for his death over and over and over. You want Superman to reduce him to ash with the power of his eyes.I have read a number of viewers' reviews, and it seems that the people who disliked the film / gave it a low rating had rather unfair and unrealistic expectations of it. That is, their own prejudices about how the plot could/should unfold or what the character development could/should be, etc. ruined the film for them. And that is a shame.My thought is: I settle into my seat, wait for the lights to dim, and then I wait to be transported by the film. I accept it, lock, stock, and barrel.As another reviewer remarked, I love how the film begins from the point of view of Bruce Wayne as he is among people on the ground who have fallen victim to the attack of Zod and the other Kryptonians.Why would Bruce Wayne not like Superman? Why would the good people of Earth hurl insults at Superman and burn him in effigy (on the news)? Because the good people of Earth just got catapulted into a new reality in which there are not only extraterrestrial beings (surprise!) but they are also superman! And a group of them are hell-bent on destroying humankind and taking the planet for themselves.It is difficult to see Superman as separate from the whole Kryptonian Krew.It seems that many moviegoers forgot that Bruce Wayne is also human. Sure, he's a hero, but he is flawed.. Just like the rest of us. He is a vigilante, after all.He has let his vigilantism get the better of him. HE is actually the one working outside the boundaries of the law, not Superman. It is the clear head of Alfred that shows us that he has gone into a rather dark place, that he has not seen what is really going on (in Luthor's scheme), and so he chooses to embark on his own scheme scheme to take out the alien invader. He is (allegedly) thinking of the future: if he wipes out the all-powerful alien, then it can't turn on humankind in the future. At least, he convinces himself of that.A philosophical question is raised in the film: should Clark Kent have remained a simple man from Kansas and never have become the Superman? Should he just let people die and let calamities happen? The question is answered for us in the character of Diana Prince/Wonder Woman. She withdrew from mankind (her exact words) and just sat around watching. Watching while people died horrible deaths all around her. So, should Superman have done the same? Do these special beings, these 'metahumans', have some kind of moral imperative to intervene, or should they be allowed to be regular people, too? It seems that humans want it both ways.It seems that humans are saying: \"Don't be a superalien ... except when I and my friends and family are in trouble. Then come save us.\""

"Batman v Superman: Ultimate Edition: If your looking for a quick, cheap thrill then you might not enjoy this film at the time. This movies theatrical version was butchered by WB and in doing so reshaped the story leaving numerous plot holes. So the Ultimate Edition is the full story and the one worth seeing. Watch 'Man of Steel' before seeing this movie. There is much to claw through here, so much so that the audience might easily find themselves exhausted from the overall aggression of the film. However, a lot of the story does work. The action is good, and the emotion feels real most of the time.This film is about Superman trying to become Superman. Trying to help the world, save people, find a place in this world not as an outcast, and yet is looked at has a threat by many. Superman is not from this world, yet He is trying to be human, find a place in this world, be excepted by earths people, and come into his destiny.This film is also about Batman being Batman for 20 years and losing faith in humanity, and fearing Superman, what Superman can do with his powers. Great film, great plot, great visuals. ---Yidioo"
"I didn't see the film in the theaters and just bought the \"Extended Edition \" on Amazon. I never properly saw Man of Steel- i think I rented it and watched it when already exhausted and fell asleep. I saw the mediocre user reviews and horrible reviews from critics of this film.They really have it wrong. This is the very best either Batman or Superman. It has a different take, on things. Much darker then earlier films even darker then the Christopher Nolan Batman films.First of all Christopher Nolan is an Executive Producer. So how bad could it be? I loved Sucker Punch and Zack Snyder was involved with that. So how bad could this be? Hans Zimmer did the music, so how bad could it be?I remember watching the old Superman TV shows and reading the Superman and Batman comics as a little kid and loved them, but i wouldn't call myself a \"fan boy\" of comic universes, like so many younger people today. As an older adult I will admit my favorite TV show of all time was Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but watched it on DVD only after it had finished. I saw the second of the Dark Knight series in the theater, but the other two, I watched on DVD. They were great, but not my favorite films like so many people. i also loved the first couple Superman and Batman films in the older series. Regardless, i was not waiting with baited breath to see Man of Steel or this one.I'm more of a serious film fan, who can watch Stanley Kubrick films over and over and my favorite films in the last twenty years, are Eyes Wide Shut and Intersteller, both of which i've watched multiple times.So, with that said, take it from me, the critics have this film very wrong, just as critics hated 2001: A Space Odyssey when it first came out. This film will have lasting appreciation.Surprised how much I liked Ben Afleck's Batman. it was hard to get into Henry Cavil's scrawnier looking Superman, but it grew on me. Amy Adams was great as Lois Lane, The Gal Gadol Wonder Women was amazing. Lex Luther was terrific, like Nolan's Joker. Jeremy Irons was the best Alfred ever. Holly Hunter and Diane Lane was good too. The movie had bad reviews but made a billion dollars. Hopefully everyone buys the Ultimate Edition and it breaks sales records and the film is re-appreciated. I have no idea what scenes this Ultimate Edition added, but it is pretty perfect. Now I can't wait for Wonder Woman and the Justice League and as soon as I finish writing this am going to watch Man of Steal. I'm into it now!I can only surmise that the bad reviews stem from too much expectations of the rigid fan boy types and the radical changes in tone, we see in this film.Total masterpiece of cinema, but I have a few criticisms. There are a few hollow scenes of typical Idiot cops and authorities getting everything wrong in a cliché type way and it has a few filler scenes of that type and a few moments here and there that felt rushed and cheesy. Maybe not everything restored into the Ultimate Edition should have been. I wish there had been more Kevin Costner scenes."

"The whole entire Batman V Superman movie was great and yes even though it felt slow to the majority of the people who watched it but to me I enjoyed every part and every scene of Batman V Superman and when it got to the fight scenes both batman VS Superman and the Doomsday fight it brought so much drama, intensity, and epic performances. So with that being said I give this movie a good 10/10 because it really did go to my expectations and it brought a powerful performance and a powerful yet epic introduction to the upcoming Justice League."

"Zack Snyder not only understands the characters but he also understands how to craft a real amazing movie for fans - honestly blew me away (extended cut) Brilliant!Don't believe what the internet is telling you to think - take this from a person who has worked in the comic book industry - this is amazing!"

"When I first wrote a review for this movie a year ago exclaiming my excitement for the film, I had been high off a fresh dose of live-action DC superheroes playing out the beloved comic book stories that I had grown up on. It was all playing out before my eyes and coming to life. After a few months had passed, I began to notice things about the movie that I disliked: little gaps in the story, things that didn't add up, etc. My original rating of a 10 / 10 dropped to an 8 /10. But today it has gone back up to a 10. The extended version of the film not only rectifies the gaps but also silences critics.Many claimed that the movie was too dark or that it just didn't make sense. To those people, I say: \"Pick up a comic book!\" Many of the critics of this particular film were part of the superhero bandwagon that formed when Marvel began its spree of Avengers-related films. In fact, its estimated that over 60% of people who go to see 'superhero' genre films have never picked up a comic book in their life. I would argue that similar numbers could figure to those which view the CW televised DC Universe shows. People complain that DC comics is just too dark but the fact is that these movies are based upon actual comics which are meant to be dark (ex: The Dark Knight Returns, Injustice, etc.). Its like complaining that Game of Thrones (the TV series) sucks because they kill off too many characters. Read the books! Its frustrating to see such a beautiful work of art like Batman V Superman criticized by those ignorant to its universe and its meaning. This movie is in fact a catalyst that opens numerous doorways and leaves true fans in awe of the possibilities for future movies. But regardless of whether or not people choose to educate themselves, this film's DVD/Blu-ray extended version puts the theater release to shame. All of the plot holes and gaps are filled in 30 minutes of extended footage scattered throughout the film. The movie ultimately becomes more complete and people will wish that the movie had shown the full 3 hours of footage in its theatrical debut. As a major DC comics fan, I will of course pick up on things that a comics fan would not, but someone who does not read comics would learn to appreciate this film in its entirety with the extended version. Get your hands on a copy today or find it on Netflix or the internet somewhere!"

"I ignored the bad reviews and watched anyways. This film had a lot to live up to after Civil War was released and I went into this film expecting the worst. It ended up to be the best Superhero film of 2016 to me. One complaint was that this film was more concerned about universe building than telling a great story than Civil War but for me it was the other way around; Civil War felt like a build up to something else and to be honest, I felt that way when I saw the other MCU films. Batman vs Superman however not only had a great story, but it also felt a lot more consistent than Civil War. This film was way more diverse with the cast than the MCU but unlike the MCU, I felt like this film doesn't go overboard with the SJW stuff like the MCU films or The Star Wars Sequel films do. The Visuals were AMAZING, The Score by Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL was AMAZING as well, The Tone is just right as I actually felt for the characters emotionally, The Cinematography kept my eyes glued to the screen, and the script felt really Intelligent and Complex and despite people calling the writing confusing, I was able to piece it together with no problem whatsoever. This film is similar to Empire Strikes back in terms of popularity so over time after the other movies are released, this movie would probably be more popular.This film was way better than I Expected and deserves another chance.

"Its shame to see what critics and marvel fans did to this movie and targeted Zack Snyder for it. I have seen this movie more than 25 times till date. And i enjoy this movie as much as i enjoyed the first time. The fans who have read DC comics, wouldn't be disappointed in this movie. Its dark movie, yes it is. Because the title shows the intense situation at hand. Two superheroes about to rip each other apart for whatever reasons that brought them to this stage. Yes it had to be dark and intense.Only marvel can be stupid enough to show an alien invasion where humans are loosing the battle and the super heroes are cracking jokes while battles as if they are playing ping pong. a person playing Call of Duty game is more serious while playing than the marvel heroes fighting aliens."

"Last week some news came out from somebody online who had claimed to have seen a finished version of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. If you were like me, you've been leery of checking it out because you weren't sure how much might actually be true. Now Zack Snyder has spoken out about the spoiler-filled post, although his response doesn't really clear anything up.In a word, to MTV, he called the post \"hilarious,which might imply that he's saying that it's mostly, if not entirely, untrue. That might be the case, but then again he could have just said it was untrue and he didn't say that. What he did say, however, is that he doesn't like spoilers. While this may seem odd for the director who's most recent trailer appeared to give away the entire movie, Snyder says that's not the case. Even if you've seen the trailer, you can rest easy, as there is much more we have not seen in then finished film. Says Snyder I have the benefit of seeing the movie. It's cool that think it's too much, and I appreciate people not wanting to know, but there's plenty that they don't know. There's a lot of movie that's not in the trailer. In the process of calling the Batman v Superman Reddit review hilarious, Snyder goes on to talk about how he hates it when spoilers come out. The director would much rather that fans see the movie mostly blind. While he understands that some fans may wish to find the answers before hand, he wants his movies to be mysteries going in. If you're, as an audience member, exploring these articles, looking for answers to questions that you have, maybe you're okay with knowing before you go. It's like an individual taste. But like I said, I want people to see the movie without knowing.Spoilers are a topic that mean different things to different people. While most try to avoid them to some degree, the need to solve the mystery is a nearly universal human experience. We have an inclination to want to know the truth, even while also wanting to be surprised. For most of us getting some information is good, but getting all the information is bad, of course, only getting the details that you want can be difficult."
"The theatrical is choppy, poorly edited, hard to follow, with some really good moments mixed in their. The extended is much more fluent and is much easier to follow, it does have a long runtime, which might make it seem a bit dragging on, but if you like long films done right, like Lord of the Rings, you will like this movie as long as you get into the characters and story. Speaking of which, the story starts out perfectly showing Bruce Wayne as a character, and it is very powerful. There are several moments in this movie that are powerful, emotional, and shocking. Characters. Batman is my favorite fictional character of all time, and believe me when I say, Ben Affleck as Batman was perfect, he had the charisma, the anger, and the look of being through some bad stuff Gal Gadot also does perfect as Wonder Woman, but if you want to really see how good she does, go watch the Wonder Woman movie. Henry Call as Superman. I really don't like it when people say Christopher Reeves is better. Don't get me wrong, Reeves does great, but can you imagine him as Superman in this movie? I wouldn't like it. It would be like Adam West playing Batman in The Dark Knight. Henry Cavill does great in this role, I can say everything about him as I said with Ben Affleck. Jesse Eisenberg as Luthor. I thought it was different in a good way. I've heard a criticism for him as being too much like Joker, but is that a bad thing? Joker is my favorite villain, so to see Superman have an enemy that crazy, but still hold the values Luthor needs to be Luthor, I think it is great. The thing I thought this movie was lacking in the first and second acts was humor, at least good humor. If there was more humor, I would've given this movie a ten because it would give a more relaxing feel to the parts that needed it. All in all though, this movie was awesome, it had powerful moments, it was badass, and just plain fun. It had a great story arc and does its job very well."

"*I will be talking about the Ultimate Edition of the film* This was one of the most anticipated CBM of all time. Ever since the arrival and subsequent success of Marvel's The Avengers people have wondered when will DC launch its own cinematic universe, one of the main reasons being the opportunity to finally see titans such as Batman and Superman share the screen together: the ultimate nerd dream. On 2016, the moment finally came for BvS to be released AND.. it performed poorly. Not only did critical reception left a lot to be desired, but fan reactions where surprisingly split after its cinematic debut. People either loved it and called Zack a genius, or hated it and called him a hack. Me, personally, I found myself with middle of the road feelings, for sure, but more leaning towards the negative side with subsequent viewings. The theatrical cut of the film showcased amazing performances, incredible visuals, and action set pieces that seemed like comic book panels come to life, in a good way. However, when it comes to its narrative structure and more technical aspects like editing, the film was seriously flawed. More plot holes than Age of Ultron, questionable character decisions, random editing that lacked cohesion and focus, and forced dramatic moments that lacked any impact because the attempts at character development ranged from limited to nonexistent, especially when it comes to Superman's character. I thought it was a 5/10 movie at best. As such, I was kind of skeptical about the idea of a 30 minute longer version. I say kind of because I know how Zack works. I remember Watchmen being vastly improved with its director's cut, so in a way I was expecting BvS to perform in a similar manner, but I also feared those 30 minutes wold be just there to amplify action and discredit storytelling issues. Oh boy, I'm so glad I was proved wrong. The ultimate cut of the film was infuriating, but not because it was awful, but because it questions the sanity of WB executives and editors and makes you wonder what were they thinking during the editing process. What I got out of the Ultimate Edition was a thought-provoking deconstruction of two very iconic superheroes that gave spotlight to the struggles both of them face when they aren't fighting crime. What I got was an extremely well produced character study on both Batman and Superman in a cynical world, a world dangerously close to our own. We meet Batman as a ruthless, worn out hero that has seen the failure behind his ideals and witnessed some truly horrifying things in his life. Superman, on the other hand, is portrayed as a godlike figure that seeks to do good in the world, but finds himself emotionally conflicted once he realized that every good deed he does leaves behind a trail of destruction (most of it due to Luthor's antics). In my opinion, this is a hugely original approach, one that distances itself from the rest of the competition and delivers a dark, somber, yet relevant superhero movie that understands both characters and gives them real human struggles to deal with. I felt invested in both of them, and hoped that by the end of the film both could find a way to redeem themselves. Their character arcs were very well established during the first two acts of the movie, and by the time we get to the titular climactic battle the emotion behind the jaw-dropping action is intensified. Lex Luthor as a villain was also given more time to develop with this new edition. One of the main criticisms with the original version was the fact that his plan relied too much on conveniences, and the character's mannerisms and mad-scientist attitude was annoying, and that goes without saying his motivations were unclear. Not only do we spend more time understanding his hate for any godlike figure and thus his hatred for Superman, but the added scenes allowed us to witness his entire plan come to fruition. It sells the cold, manipulative, calculating attributes of his comic counterpart. The acting is spot on. Every actor owns his/her role, from Cavill's Superman, to Ben Affleck as Batman, Eisenberg as Luthor, and Gadot as Wonder Woman, whose scenes are brief, but are more than enough to sell the strong and ferocious warrior that she is. Cinematography is stunning, and miles above that of Man of Steel's. And the soundtrack by Zimmer and Junkie XL? Perfect, just perfect. When it comes to flaws, the film still has some of those. The Martha moment, while serving as a pivotal character moment for Batman, felt off in execution, and its understandable that many people got mad at it. If your main complaint about BvS the first time around was its bleak tone and subject matter, this film is still not for you. I understand most were expecting to see the heroes being the most iconic versions of themselves, clashing in an elongated battle and evoking the same feelings The Avengers gave audiences back in 2012. In that sense, the film will remain divisive, but at least I have the comfort of saying that, at the very least, the film is competently made."

"This film was amazing. Ben Affleck was easily the best part of this movie, he brought his a-game as Batman. The chemistry between Affleck & Irons was outstanding. Gal Gadot did a great job as Wonder Woman. The fight between Batman & Superman was awesome. The final fight with Doomsday was outstanding in every way possible. However, there is only one problem with this film and that's Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor. He was sadly missed cast in this role, but then again it's really the fault of Warner Bros. Studios. Overall, this film deliver on almost every level. I highly recommend that you watch the extended version of this film."

"I know I know. I saw it in theaters too, and felt like it could've been so much better. While the Batman element was good, the narrative felt fractured, and the third act was just one long stunt scene. Superman was relegated to a supporting character, and other characters didn't get a chance to shine. And then I chanced on the ultimate cut. Calling it 30 mins of \"extra\" footage is unfair to Zack Snyder because it's exactly these 30 mins that makes the movie a worthy one. What I can say about the theatrical cut is this - It had the blockbuster elements - music, visuals, stunts, CGI. But, it lacked the human elements. The first 20 mins of the movie had it, but not after that. The extended cut in comparison has a flow to the narrative. There are no disjointed scenes, everything flows smoothly, and there's connective tissue. Superman gets to spend some time with his father, and mother. Clark Kent does some investigative journalism. Superman helps the people after the blast. Lois Lane doesn't jump to conclusions, she gets to the bottom of the crime. Lex Luthor apparently had a coherent plan - everything is explained pretty well. Wonder Woman was already good, so there's no change there :) Also, the \"Martha\" scene seems better executed, because it is a few seconds longer, and there's time to breathe it in. So, here's my take on this movie - The theatrical cut was junk. Get the Bluray for ultimate edition, and you shall not be disappointed. I've seen it so many more times now, and it's the definitive cut. It is the movie we deserve. It's a unique take on Batman, and Superman. It's a gritty take on the superhero movie genre, and definitely the best DCEU movie, and the best DC movie since The Dark Knight.P.S. Yes it's dark. We're adults, and we should appreciate mature film making without intentionally silly moments. It attempts to be philosophical, and something deep instead of just trying to make you chuckle."

"This is one of the best superhero movies ever made. Zack Snyder is a magician behind the camera.The reason behind so many complaints is the fact that Warner Bros. marketed this movie as a fight between Batman and Superman. That's not what it is. It's a movie about the origins of the Justice League.The cinematography, the acting and the score are all second to none. This film is phenomenal.P.S: watch the 3 hour extended cut that Snyder intended you to see, not the 2 and a half hour movie that Warner Bros. decided would be better for theaters."

"I don't care what the critics say, this is a very well-done movie. I'll start my review by listing what I like about the movie.1.) Ben Affleck is the best batman to me and it is not close. He pulls off the role of an aging batman extremely well. Also, Zack Snyder's vision of batman is legit. I have always hated batman up until this adaptation of him. Instead of being a conflicted and idealistic batman, this batman is dark, gritty, and 100% a badass. His equipment is decked out with machine guns and he has no aversion to killing people. In fact, he probably kills about 50 criminal by the time this movie is over. The warehouse scene is the coolest batman scene in any movie.2.) The development of a grudge between batman and superman is pulled off flawlessly. It actually makes sense why batman dislikes superman. Then, when they do fight it is about the coolest thing you can expect to see from a superhero film. 3.) I disagree with a lot of people about Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor. In my opinion, he played his role to perfection. 4.) B v S sets up Wonder Woman and Justice League with Gal Gadot's cameo as Wonder Woman and short clips of Aquaman, the Flash, and Cyborg. B v S is one of my favorite superhero films and rewatching it never gets old."

"The theatrical cut of this film is garbage which is why I rated it eight stars instead of nine. The first time I watched this film I didn't like it (not straight out hate but didn't like). Character motivations didn't make any sense, Lex was annoying as s***, editing was sloppy, and it was overly dark and broody for an action superhero movie. A year + a half, five Marvel films, a ton of bad reviews and a Justice League later a thought popped into my head: \"what if I watched BVS again\". This time I didn't have trailers ruining the best moments, I only vaguely remembered the film, and I was conditioned to look at it negatively but something unexpected happened: I actually loved it. Superman was just a normal person that tried to make a difference cause he could that others imposed their own beliefs on. Lex Luthor was a genius that couldn't stand his powerlessness compared to Superman or more accurately a super being. As Alfred said \"The fever, the rage, the feeling of powerlessness that turns good men... cruel\" and you see the same thought process in Batman. Batman, just like Lex Luthor feels powerless in the midst of a god-being and just like Lex he attempts to destroy him so he can get his sense of power back but unlike Lex, Batman learns something. I what is one of the corniest lines of the movie Superman says, \"Martha\" when he knows he can't win against Batman in a late desperate attempt to save his mother. Not only does this name connect with Bruce Wayne but it also shows what really matters to a man of steel: it isn't power, it isn't fame or anything else, it is his Mother and on a broader scale it is people. Lex (who doesn't care about people at all) knows he doesn't have the power so he creates something from his blood and the remains of Zod: A Doomsday for Superman. Not only does this film have depth but it also doesn't always explain it to you which is rare in a blockbuster action superhero flick normally cater to semi-comic book fans and people that want to shove popcorn in their mouths. This film rewards you for really noticing the details while still having massive explosions. One of my favorites is how Lex has all of Batman's branded killed which is why he isn't afraid of the branding at the end or Grandma's Peach Tea as a way of scaring the s*** out of someone. Of course, this film isn't perfect and I do have personal dislikes. The Batman V Superman fight was slow and pretty boring especially after watching such an amazing fight in Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 2 (If you haven't watched the animated Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 1 and 2 you are sorely missing out on something fantastic). Also, the addition of Wonder Woman who pretty much steals a hacker thing, gives it back and then suits up and fights against a giant monster thing. Not to say I don't like Wonder Woman (She is one of my favorite Superheroes of all time who showed not only can woman kick a** but they also don't need to be ashamed of their sexuality or gender) but she wasn't really that helpful to the plot and just brought in to expand the universe which was well done through Lex's superhuman hunting files. Also, the post-apocalyptic scene that was just a dream could have been cut but nothing is perfect except movies like Citizen Kane which isn't a lot of fun to watch cause it is too perfect. So to summarize, the theatrical cut is bad, the ultimate cut is Amazing and the other cut is meh. Please give it a second chance because it deserves it and save a good director from losing grace because of something he didn't do."
"I really liked it, don't know what all the hate is about. I'm actually a Marvel fan from when I was 7 or so, but Superman and Batman together in 1 movie? Just great. And personally I like Ben Affleck even better than Christian Bale as Batman. So just watch and enjoy, I know I did!"

"That's right. We have been waiting for these two heroes to finally meet and fight against each other. This movie is so good in both plot and special effects.Henry Cavill and Ben Affleck have performed well in their acting stages. They are the best superhero actors and they have filmed their fighting scenes very well. The movie starts to show the conflict between the lives of the heroes and now they have blamed each other for it. This movie is amazing and sets up a good plot for Dawn Justice."

"Actually...I didn't know what to expect. When you see Wonder Woman, you know it will be off of Wonder Woman and off of a Wonder Woman story, but with Batman V Superman, I was like, \"hmmmm, so who is this about?\" It was pretty obvious that it would feature many characters, but I thought the introduction to Batman was amazing. Ben Affleck nailed the part, not only as Batman but also as Bruce Wayne. He is my Batman. Henry Cavill continued to be super as the Man of Steel. And he is my Super - Man. A dark story? Yes, without a doubt. Could it have had a few more jokes? Sure. But not all movies or stories need to have jokes when certain events are serious. I really hope people can see this review and take another look at the movie, because, I loved it. I really hope the ratings can go up, eventually. And P.S, this movie is the perfect set up to Justice League."

"I'll start by making it clear I have only ever seen the Ultimate Edition. I'm aware of what was cut out for the theatrical release, so I will concede up front that most of the criticisms about pacing, editing, and missing bits of plot at release were merited.With that caveat out of the way, I must reiterate that this was bar-none the boldest superhero movie I have ever seen. To me, it was arguably the best as well, though \"best\" shouldn't be taken to mean \"most enjoyable.\" That honor easily goes to \"Thor: Ragnarok.\" What makes BvS stand out among other films in the genre is that it takes two characters who have been done to death since the 1970s and brings them up to date. I recently tried to watch \"Superman: The Movie\" for the first time in a number of years, and while it was still good and Reeves will always be iconic, I just couldn't take it seriously. I'll put it this way: If the story in BvS was \"stupid\" in your view but Superman turning back time by spinning the earth backward on its axis didn't seem like one of the dumbest things you have ever seen -in any movie from any genre- to the extent that it outright ruins the movie for you, then your opinion about BvS isn't worth much. Nostalgic bias was always going to be a problem for this movie, and the way people reacted to and reviewed \"Man of Steel\" was telling in this regard.That brings me to Zack Snyder's take on Superman. You know, that guy whose status as the first extraterrestrial ever encountered by humanity was a total non-issue in the old movies. Apparently, Snyder has a similar view to my own in that his take on the Man of Steel makes his being an alien a core piece of his identity. He may look like any other (absurdly attractive) person, but he knows what he is, and that makes him perpetually uncertain of where he fits in this world. He is essentially good and really does care about people, but he struggles to truly empathize with the likes of us. To be human is to be frail, and that is not something he can easily relate to. This is the root of his conflict with Batman.Just as Clark struggles to genuinely relate to most people, Snyder's Batman either refuses to or otherwise just can't relate to Superman. He doesn't see him as anything but a threat regardless of Superman's clear good intentions. Remember, a small group of Kryptonians were able to bring humanity to the brink of extinction in less than a day, and Bruce Wayne is nothing if not a realist. He didn't know the guy from Kansas. He only knew the god from another world.While Batman's anger toward and fear of Superman are readily apparent from the start, Superman's inability to imagine things from Bruce Wayne's perspective only becomes truly apparent during their first real interaction. This reminded me of the animated version of the \"world's finest\" storyline, where Superman judges Batman harshly for using fear tactics and threats of violence (also, actual violence) to get the job done. Superman wasn't willing to consider what it would take for a human man to fight criminals and save innocents, or what that life would do to him over time. Just as Batman didn't see the guy from Kansas, Superman didn't see the man who lives his life trapped in one brutal, unthinkably traumatic moment (this was beautifully conveyed during the film's opening moments), and had spent his whole adult life bearing witness to humanity at its absolute worst.The conflict between these two characters is as old as human history. They want the same things, but they can't understand one another. So they fight. And what a fight it was.Watching a fight between, say, Captain America and Iron Man was, to me, more frustrating than anything because each understood the other's perspective perfectly. The fight between Batman and Superman in BvS was genuinely gut-wrenching, as intended, because they would have understood one another if either had tried. The whole sequence hilighted Batman's tactical prowess and ability to control a situation. Maybe the most badass thing about the fight was that it ended exactly where Batman planned. That brings me to the big elephant in the room named \"Martha.\"I can't recall exactly which YouTuber put it this way, but if you thought the \"save Martha\" exchange was about their mothers having the same name, you had your brain turned off. The brain-on people have explained this to death, but it bears repeating. This was the moment when Superman became humanized to Batman. He was about to die, and his only concern was for his adoptive human mother. He still believed that the man about to take his life would do the right thing. Even with the cowl on, there was no mistaking the look on Batman's face. It was the look of shame, guilt, and sudden uncertainty that says \"What am I doing?\" Turns out even the most brutal, angry version of Bruce Wayne is better than Tony Stark at knowing right from wrong. At knowing that he had gone too far.From there, the third act was a series of truly impressive (albeit mostly CGI) fight sequences, beginning with what I regard as the undisputed champion of Batman fights. Nothing in the Nolan movies (and especially nothing in the Burton movies) even came close. Go ahead, try to convince yourself that Batman and Bane taking turns punching one another in the face until Bane's mask broke was a good fight sequence. No, this was a fight straight out of \"Arkham Knight,\" and it was glorious. The battle against Doomsday really was one for the books. From the moment Wonder Woman arrived accompanied by the intense sounds of Tina Guo's electric cello to Superman's tragic, heroic death at the hands of Doomsday, I was glued to the screen. Sure, the mere presence of Doomsday spoiled the end to a degree, but watching the Man of Steel laboring to carry that kryptonite spear towards certain death was no less impactful. A brief word on Jesse Eisenberg's take on Lex Luthor. At least one other reviewer on this site already said it best when they pointed out that this was his origin story. If you consider his scheme objectively, he is actually one of the more formidable incarnations of the character. If we're lucky, we'll eventually get to see a Snyder Cut of \"Justice League\" and find out where this story was actually meant to go. For the record, Joss Whedon and Danny Elfman both should have said \"no\" to taking a dump on someone else's art."
"BATMAN V SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE brings a fantastic surprise to a smash-hit team-up with one of the worlds most beloved DC Comics' icons of all time. The movie delivers spectacular casting, and fantastic acting with different characters having their shine in each scenes.The story follows Clark Kent/Superman who becomes a threat, after the destruction in Metropolis in Man Of Steel.(2013). Batman/Bruce Wayne sees him as a threat and begins his war on Superman.The movie brings spectacular storytelling, it tells the complications of human against alien who are on the same side, and the first meeting of Batman and Superman. The story of Bruce Wayne, with his many years of The Caped Crusader, sends him on a spiral of \"out of control\", sheer anger, and builds tension to wanting to defeat the Man of Steel. Snyder has fantastically gave this storytelling an exciting nod to the comics.Lex Luthor, played by Jesse Einsberg, delivers a very interesting performance, but very differently by him showing is his \"origin\" before he becomes a bald foe to the Man of Steel. He shows that his love of \"god vs man\" terrorises mankind when he ultimately creates Doomsday, and Batman realises Superman's inner heroism.It packs so many great \"out of nowhere\" excitement, including a first-look of the fearful Wonder Woman a.k.a. Diana Prince, played by Gal Gadot, and a fresh-new glimpse of the superhero DC canon: The Justice League.WATCH THIS MOVIE! The critics are out of their mind. It's a fun-packed action adventure which still keeps the movie enjoyable until it's final minutes of the movie. It's a FANTASTIC MOVIE! BEN AFFLECK AS BATMAN... is Incredible!A 10/10 overall!"
"I want to go on record as saying that this is a truly thrilling cinematic experience in so many ways. If pressed, I guess I could acknowledge that there were a couple ... let's say \"clumsy\" moments. And in a film that runs to three hours, that hardly seems like a significant issue, certainly not enough to rate it with fewer than 9 stars.This film has everything. There is dramatic tension right from the start. There is a magnificent story arc that picks up quite seamlessly from 'Man of Steel' and propels the viewer not only into the life of Clark Kent/Superman but also of Bruce Wayne/Batman.The villain is no mere cartoon of a villain; he is truly thoroughly (and apparently irrevocably) diabolical. He is a psychopath, and you wish for his death over and over and over. You want Superman to reduce him to ash with the power of his eyes.I have read a number of viewers' reviews, and it seems that the people who disliked the film / gave it a low rating had rather unfair and unrealistic expectations of it. That is, their own prejudices about how the plot could/should unfold or what the character development could/should be, etc. ruined the film for them. And that is a shame.My thought is: I settle into my seat, wait for the lights to dim, and then I wait to be transported by the film. I accept it, lock, stock, and barrel.As another reviewer remarked, I love how the film begins from the point of view of Bruce Wayne as he is among people on the ground who have fallen victim to the attack of Zod and the other Kryptonians.Why would Bruce Wayne not like Superman? Why would the good people of Earth hurl insults at Superman and burn him in effigy (on the news)? Because the good people of Earth just got catapulted into a new reality in which there are not only extraterrestrial beings (surprise!) but they are also superman! And a group of them are hell-bent on destroying humankind and taking the planet for themselves.It is difficult to see Superman as separate from the whole Kryptonian Krew.It seems that many moviegoers forgot that Bruce Wayne is also human. Sure, he's a hero, but he is flawed.. Just like the rest of us. He is a vigilante, after all.He has let his vigilantism get the better of him. HE is actually the one working outside the boundaries of the law, not Superman. It is the clear head of Alfred that shows us that he has gone into a rather dark place, that he has not seen what is really going on (in Luthor's scheme), and so he chooses to embark on his own scheme scheme to take out the alien invader. He is (allegedly) thinking of the future: if he wipes out the all-powerful alien, then it can't turn on humankind in the future. At least, he convinces himself of that.A philosophical question is raised in the film: should Clark Kent have remained a simple man from Kansas and never have become the Superman? Should he just let people die and let calamities happen? The question is answered for us in the character of Diana Prince/Wonder Woman. She withdrew from mankind (her exact words) and just sat around watching. Watching while people died horrible deaths all around her. So, should Superman have done the same? Do these special beings, these 'metahumans', have some kind of moral imperative to intervene, or should they be allowed to be regular people, too? It seems that humans want it both ways.It seems that humans are saying: \"Don't be a superalien ... except when I and my friends and family are in trouble. Then come save us.\""

"Batman v Superman: Ultimate Edition: If your looking for a quick, cheap thrill then you might not enjoy this film at the time. This movies theatrical version was butchered by WB and in doing so reshaped the story leaving numerous plot holes. So the Ultimate Edition is the full story and the one worth seeing. Watch 'Man of Steel' before seeing this movie. There is much to claw through here, so much so that the audience might easily find themselves exhausted from the overall aggression of the film. However, a lot of the story does work. The action is good, and the emotion feels real most of the time.This film is about Superman trying to become Superman. Trying to help the world, save people, find a place in this world not as an outcast, and yet is looked at has a threat by many. Superman is not from this world, yet He is trying to be human, find a place in this world, be excepted by earths people, and come into his destiny.This film is also about Batman being Batman for 20 years and losing faith in humanity, and fearing Superman, what Superman can do with his powers. Great film, great plot, great visuals. ---Yidioo"
"I didn't see the film in the theaters and just bought the \"Extended Edition \" on Amazon. I never properly saw Man of Steel- i think I rented it and watched it when already exhausted and fell asleep. I saw the mediocre user reviews and horrible reviews from critics of this film.They really have it wrong. This is the very best either Batman or Superman. It has a different take, on things. Much darker then earlier films even darker then the Christopher Nolan Batman films.First of all Christopher Nolan is an Executive Producer. So how bad could it be? I loved Sucker Punch and Zack Snyder was involved with that. So how bad could this be? Hans Zimmer did the music, so how bad could it be?I remember watching the old Superman TV shows and reading the Superman and Batman comics as a little kid and loved them, but i wouldn't call myself a \"fan boy\" of comic universes, like so many younger people today. As an older adult I will admit my favorite TV show of all time was Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but watched it on DVD only after it had finished. I saw the second of the Dark Knight series in the theater, but the other two, I watched on DVD. They were great, but not my favorite films like so many people. i also loved the first couple Superman and Batman films in the older series. Regardless, i was not waiting with baited breath to see Man of Steel or this one.I'm more of a serious film fan, who can watch Stanley Kubrick films over and over and my favorite films in the last twenty years, are Eyes Wide Shut and Intersteller, both of which i've watched multiple times.So, with that said, take it from me, the critics have this film very wrong, just as critics hated 2001: A Space Odyssey when it first came out. This film will have lasting appreciation.Surprised how much I liked Ben Afleck's Batman. it was hard to get into Henry Cavil's scrawnier looking Superman, but it grew on me. Amy Adams was great as Lois Lane, The Gal Gadol Wonder Women was amazing. Lex Luther was terrific, like Nolan's Joker. Jeremy Irons was the best Alfred ever. Holly Hunter and Diane Lane was good too. The movie had bad reviews but made a billion dollars. Hopefully everyone buys the Ultimate Edition and it breaks sales records and the film is re-appreciated. I have no idea what scenes this Ultimate Edition added, but it is pretty perfect. Now I can't wait for Wonder Woman and the Justice League and as soon as I finish writing this am going to watch Man of Steal. I'm into it now!I can only surmise that the bad reviews stem from too much expectations of the rigid fan boy types and the radical changes in tone, we see in this film.Total masterpiece of cinema, but I have a few criticisms. There are a few hollow scenes of typical Idiot cops and authorities getting everything wrong in a cliché type way and it has a few filler scenes of that type and a few moments here and there that felt rushed and cheesy. Maybe not everything restored into the Ultimate Edition should have been. I wish there had been more Kevin Costner scenes."

"The whole entire Batman V Superman movie was great and yes even though it felt slow to the majority of the people who watched it but to me I enjoyed every part and every scene of Batman V Superman and when it got to the fight scenes both batman VS Superman and the Doomsday fight it brought so much drama, intensity, and epic performances. So with that being said I give this movie a good 10/10 because it really did go to my expectations and it brought a powerful performance and a powerful yet epic introduction to the upcoming Justice League."

"Zack Snyder not only understands the characters but he also understands how to craft a real amazing movie for fans - honestly blew me away (extended cut) Brilliant!Don't believe what the internet is telling you to think - take this from a person who has worked in the comic book industry - this is amazing!"

"When I first wrote a review for this movie a year ago exclaiming my excitement for the film, I had been high off a fresh dose of live-action DC superheroes playing out the beloved comic book stories that I had grown up on. It was all playing out before my eyes and coming to life. After a few months had passed, I began to notice things about the movie that I disliked: little gaps in the story, things that didn't add up, etc. My original rating of a 10 / 10 dropped to an 8 /10. But today it has gone back up to a 10. The extended version of the film not only rectifies the gaps but also silences critics.Many claimed that the movie was too dark or that it just didn't make sense. To those people, I say: \"Pick up a comic book!\" Many of the critics of this particular film were part of the superhero bandwagon that formed when Marvel began its spree of Avengers-related films. In fact, its estimated that over 60% of people who go to see 'superhero' genre films have never picked up a comic book in their life. I would argue that similar numbers could figure to those which view the CW televised DC Universe shows. People complain that DC comics is just too dark but the fact is that these movies are based upon actual comics which are meant to be dark (ex: The Dark Knight Returns, Injustice, etc.). Its like complaining that Game of Thrones (the TV series) sucks because they kill off too many characters. Read the books! Its frustrating to see such a beautiful work of art like Batman V Superman criticized by those ignorant to its universe and its meaning. This movie is in fact a catalyst that opens numerous doorways and leaves true fans in awe of the possibilities for future movies. But regardless of whether or not people choose to educate themselves, this film's DVD/Blu-ray extended version puts the theater release to shame. All of the plot holes and gaps are filled in 30 minutes of extended footage scattered throughout the film. The movie ultimately becomes more complete and people will wish that the movie had shown the full 3 hours of footage in its theatrical debut. As a major DC comics fan, I will of course pick up on things that a comics fan would not, but someone who does not read comics would learn to appreciate this film in its entirety with the extended version. Get your hands on a copy today or find it on Netflix or the internet somewhere!"

"I ignored the bad reviews and watched anyways. This film had a lot to live up to after Civil War was released and I went into this film expecting the worst. It ended up to be the best Superhero film of 2016 to me. One complaint was that this film was more concerned about universe building than telling a great story than Civil War but for me it was the other way around; Civil War felt like a build up to something else and to be honest, I felt that way when I saw the other MCU films. Batman vs Superman however not only had a great story, but it also felt a lot more consistent than Civil War. This film was way more diverse with the cast than the MCU but unlike the MCU, I felt like this film doesn't go overboard with the SJW stuff like the MCU films or The Star Wars Sequel films do. The Visuals were AMAZING, The Score by Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL was AMAZING as well, The Tone is just right as I actually felt for the characters emotionally, The Cinematography kept my eyes glued to the screen, and the script felt really Intelligent and Complex and despite people calling the writing confusing, I was able to piece it together with no problem whatsoever. This film is similar to Empire Strikes back in terms of popularity so over time after the other movies are released, this movie would probably be more popular.This film was way better than I Expected and deserves another chance.

"Its shame to see what critics and marvel fans did to this movie and targeted Zack Snyder for it. I have seen this movie more than 25 times till date. And i enjoy this movie as much as i enjoyed the first time. The fans who have read DC comics, wouldn't be disappointed in this movie. Its dark movie, yes it is. Because the title shows the intense situation at hand. Two superheroes about to rip each other apart for whatever reasons that brought them to this stage. Yes it had to be dark and intense.Only marvel can be stupid enough to show an alien invasion where humans are loosing the battle and the super heroes are cracking jokes while battles as if they are playing ping pong. a person playing Call of Duty game is more serious while playing than the marvel heroes fighting aliens."

"Last week some news came out from somebody online who had claimed to have seen a finished version of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. If you were like me, you've been leery of checking it out because you weren't sure how much might actually be true. Now Zack Snyder has spoken out about the spoiler-filled post, although his response doesn't really clear anything up.In a word, to MTV, he called the post \"hilarious,which might imply that he's saying that it's mostly, if not entirely, untrue. That might be the case, but then again he could have just said it was untrue and he didn't say that. What he did say, however, is that he doesn't like spoilers. While this may seem odd for the director who's most recent trailer appeared to give away the entire movie, Snyder says that's not the case. Even if you've seen the trailer, you can rest easy, as there is much more we have not seen in then finished film. Says Snyder I have the benefit of seeing the movie. It's cool that think it's too much, and I appreciate people not wanting to know, but there's plenty that they don't know. There's a lot of movie that's not in the trailer. In the process of calling the Batman v Superman Reddit review hilarious, Snyder goes on to talk about how he hates it when spoilers come out. The director would much rather that fans see the movie mostly blind. While he understands that some fans may wish to find the answers before hand, he wants his movies to be mysteries going in. If you're, as an audience member, exploring these articles, looking for answers to questions that you have, maybe you're okay with knowing before you go. It's like an individual taste. But like I said, I want people to see the movie without knowing.Spoilers are a topic that mean different things to different people. While most try to avoid them to some degree, the need to solve the mystery is a nearly universal human experience. We have an inclination to want to know the truth, even while also wanting to be surprised. For most of us getting some information is good, but getting all the information is bad, of course, only getting the details that you want can be difficult."
"The theatrical is choppy, poorly edited, hard to follow, with some really good moments mixed in their. The extended is much more fluent and is much easier to follow, it does have a long runtime, which might make it seem a bit dragging on, but if you like long films done right, like Lord of the Rings, you will like this movie as long as you get into the characters and story. Speaking of which, the story starts out perfectly showing Bruce Wayne as a character, and it is very powerful. There are several moments in this movie that are powerful, emotional, and shocking. Characters. Batman is my favorite fictional character of all time, and believe me when I say, Ben Affleck as Batman was perfect, he had the charisma, the anger, and the look of being through some bad stuff Gal Gadot also does perfect as Wonder Woman, but if you want to really see how good she does, go watch the Wonder Woman movie. Henry Call as Superman. I really don't like it when people say Christopher Reeves is better. Don't get me wrong, Reeves does great, but can you imagine him as Superman in this movie? I wouldn't like it. It would be like Adam West playing Batman in The Dark Knight. Henry Cavill does great in this role, I can say everything about him as I said with Ben Affleck. Jesse Eisenberg as Luthor. I thought it was different in a good way. I've heard a criticism for him as being too much like Joker, but is that a bad thing? Joker is my favorite villain, so to see Superman have an enemy that crazy, but still hold the values Luthor needs to be Luthor, I think it is great. The thing I thought this movie was lacking in the first and second acts was humor, at least good humor. If there was more humor, I would've given this movie a ten because it would give a more relaxing feel to the parts that needed it. All in all though, this movie was awesome, it had powerful moments, it was badass, and just plain fun. It had a great story arc and does its job very well."

"*I will be talking about the Ultimate Edition of the film* This was one of the most anticipated CBM of all time. Ever since the arrival and subsequent success of Marvel's The Avengers people have wondered when will DC launch its own cinematic universe, one of the main reasons being the opportunity to finally see titans such as Batman and Superman share the screen together: the ultimate nerd dream. On 2016, the moment finally came for BvS to be released AND.. it performed poorly. Not only did critical reception left a lot to be desired, but fan reactions where surprisingly split after its cinematic debut. People either loved it and called Zack a genius, or hated it and called him a hack. Me, personally, I found myself with middle of the road feelings, for sure, but more leaning towards the negative side with subsequent viewings. The theatrical cut of the film showcased amazing performances, incredible visuals, and action set pieces that seemed like comic book panels come to life, in a good way. However, when it comes to its narrative structure and more technical aspects like editing, the film was seriously flawed. More plot holes than Age of Ultron, questionable character decisions, random editing that lacked cohesion and focus, and forced dramatic moments that lacked any impact because the attempts at character development ranged from limited to nonexistent, especially when it comes to Superman's character. I thought it was a 5/10 movie at best. As such, I was kind of skeptical about the idea of a 30 minute longer version. I say kind of because I know how Zack works. I remember Watchmen being vastly improved with its director's cut, so in a way I was expecting BvS to perform in a similar manner, but I also feared those 30 minutes wold be just there to amplify action and discredit storytelling issues. Oh boy, I'm so glad I was proved wrong. The ultimate cut of the film was infuriating, but not because it was awful, but because it questions the sanity of WB executives and editors and makes you wonder what were they thinking during the editing process. What I got out of the Ultimate Edition was a thought-provoking deconstruction of two very iconic superheroes that gave spotlight to the struggles both of them face when they aren't fighting crime. What I got was an extremely well produced character study on both Batman and Superman in a cynical world, a world dangerously close to our own. We meet Batman as a ruthless, worn out hero that has seen the failure behind his ideals and witnessed some truly horrifying things in his life. Superman, on the other hand, is portrayed as a godlike figure that seeks to do good in the world, but finds himself emotionally conflicted once he realized that every good deed he does leaves behind a trail of destruction (most of it due to Luthor's antics). In my opinion, this is a hugely original approach, one that distances itself from the rest of the competition and delivers a dark, somber, yet relevant superhero movie that understands both characters and gives them real human struggles to deal with. I felt invested in both of them, and hoped that by the end of the film both could find a way to redeem themselves. Their character arcs were very well established during the first two acts of the movie, and by the time we get to the titular climactic battle the emotion behind the jaw-dropping action is intensified. Lex Luthor as a villain was also given more time to develop with this new edition. One of the main criticisms with the original version was the fact that his plan relied too much on conveniences, and the character's mannerisms and mad-scientist attitude was annoying, and that goes without saying his motivations were unclear. Not only do we spend more time understanding his hate for any godlike figure and thus his hatred for Superman, but the added scenes allowed us to witness his entire plan come to fruition. It sells the cold, manipulative, calculating attributes of his comic counterpart. The acting is spot on. Every actor owns his/her role, from Cavill's Superman, to Ben Affleck as Batman, Eisenberg as Luthor, and Gadot as Wonder Woman, whose scenes are brief, but are more than enough to sell the strong and ferocious warrior that she is. Cinematography is stunning, and miles above that of Man of Steel's. And the soundtrack by Zimmer and Junkie XL? Perfect, just perfect. When it comes to flaws, the film still has some of those. The Martha moment, while serving as a pivotal character moment for Batman, felt off in execution, and its understandable that many people got mad at it. If your main complaint about BvS the first time around was its bleak tone and subject matter, this film is still not for you. I understand most were expecting to see the heroes being the most iconic versions of themselves, clashing in an elongated battle and evoking the same feelings The Avengers gave audiences back in 2012. In that sense, the film will remain divisive, but at least I have the comfort of saying that, at the very least, the film is competently made."

"This film was amazing. Ben Affleck was easily the best part of this movie, he brought his a-game as Batman. The chemistry between Affleck & Irons was outstanding. Gal Gadot did a great job as Wonder Woman. The fight between Batman & Superman was awesome. The final fight with Doomsday was outstanding in every way possible. However, there is only one problem with this film and that's Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor. He was sadly missed cast in this role, but then again it's really the fault of Warner Bros. Studios. Overall, this film deliver on almost every level. I highly recommend that you watch the extended version of this film."

"I know I know. I saw it in theaters too, and felt like it could've been so much better. While the Batman element was good, the narrative felt fractured, and the third act was just one long stunt scene. Superman was relegated to a supporting character, and other characters didn't get a chance to shine. And then I chanced on the ultimate cut. Calling it 30 mins of \"extra\" footage is unfair to Zack Snyder because it's exactly these 30 mins that makes the movie a worthy one. What I can say about the theatrical cut is this - It had the blockbuster elements - music, visuals, stunts, CGI. But, it lacked the human elements. The first 20 mins of the movie had it, but not after that. The extended cut in comparison has a flow to the narrative. There are no disjointed scenes, everything flows smoothly, and there's connective tissue. Superman gets to spend some time with his father, and mother. Clark Kent does some investigative journalism. Superman helps the people after the blast. Lois Lane doesn't jump to conclusions, she gets to the bottom of the crime. Lex Luthor apparently had a coherent plan - everything is explained pretty well. Wonder Woman was already good, so there's no change there :) Also, the \"Martha\" scene seems better executed, because it is a few seconds longer, and there's time to breathe it in. So, here's my take on this movie - The theatrical cut was junk. Get the Bluray for ultimate edition, and you shall not be disappointed. I've seen it so many more times now, and it's the definitive cut. It is the movie we deserve. It's a unique take on Batman, and Superman. It's a gritty take on the superhero movie genre, and definitely the best DCEU movie, and the best DC movie since The Dark Knight.P.S. Yes it's dark. We're adults, and we should appreciate mature film making without intentionally silly moments. It attempts to be philosophical, and something deep instead of just trying to make you chuckle."

"This is one of the best superhero movies ever made. Zack Snyder is a magician behind the camera.The reason behind so many complaints is the fact that Warner Bros. marketed this movie as a fight between Batman and Superman. That's not what it is. It's a movie about the origins of the Justice League.The cinematography, the acting and the score are all second to none. This film is phenomenal.P.S: watch the 3 hour extended cut that Snyder intended you to see, not the 2 and a half hour movie that Warner Bros. decided would be better for theaters."

"I don't care what the critics say, this is a very well-done movie. I'll start my review by listing what I like about the movie.1.) Ben Affleck is the best batman to me and it is not close. He pulls off the role of an aging batman extremely well. Also, Zack Snyder's vision of batman is legit. I have always hated batman up until this adaptation of him. Instead of being a conflicted and idealistic batman, this batman is dark, gritty, and 100% a badass. His equipment is decked out with machine guns and he has no aversion to killing people. In fact, he probably kills about 50 criminal by the time this movie is over. The warehouse scene is the coolest batman scene in any movie.2.) The development of a grudge between batman and superman is pulled off flawlessly. It actually makes sense why batman dislikes superman. Then, when they do fight it is about the coolest thing you can expect to see from a superhero film. 3.) I disagree with a lot of people about Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor. In my opinion, he played his role to perfection. 4.) B v S sets up Wonder Woman and Justice League with Gal Gadot's cameo as Wonder Woman and short clips of Aquaman, the Flash, and Cyborg. B v S is one of my favorite superhero films and rewatching it never gets old."

"The theatrical cut of this film is garbage which is why I rated it eight stars instead of nine. The first time I watched this film I didn't like it (not straight out hate but didn't like). Character motivations didn't make any sense, Lex was annoying as s***, editing was sloppy, and it was overly dark and broody for an action superhero movie. A year + a half, five Marvel films, a ton of bad reviews and a Justice League later a thought popped into my head: \"what if I watched BVS again\". This time I didn't have trailers ruining the best moments, I only vaguely remembered the film, and I was conditioned to look at it negatively but something unexpected happened: I actually loved it. Superman was just a normal person that tried to make a difference cause he could that others imposed their own beliefs on. Lex Luthor was a genius that couldn't stand his powerlessness compared to Superman or more accurately a super being. As Alfred said \"The fever, the rage, the feeling of powerlessness that turns good men... cruel\" and you see the same thought process in Batman. Batman, just like Lex Luthor feels powerless in the midst of a god-being and just like Lex he attempts to destroy him so he can get his sense of power back but unlike Lex, Batman learns something. I what is one of the corniest lines of the movie Superman says, \"Martha\" when he knows he can't win against Batman in a late desperate attempt to save his mother. Not only does this name connect with Bruce Wayne but it also shows what really matters to a man of steel: it isn't power, it isn't fame or anything else, it is his Mother and on a broader scale it is people. Lex (who doesn't care about people at all) knows he doesn't have the power so he creates something from his blood and the remains of Zod: A Doomsday for Superman. Not only does this film have depth but it also doesn't always explain it to you which is rare in a blockbuster action superhero flick normally cater to semi-comic book fans and people that want to shove popcorn in their mouths. This film rewards you for really noticing the details while still having massive explosions. One of my favorites is how Lex has all of Batman's branded killed which is why he isn't afraid of the branding at the end or Grandma's Peach Tea as a way of scaring the s*** out of someone. Of course, this film isn't perfect and I do have personal dislikes. The Batman V Superman fight was slow and pretty boring especially after watching such an amazing fight in Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 2 (If you haven't watched the animated Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 1 and 2 you are sorely missing out on something fantastic). Also, the addition of Wonder Woman who pretty much steals a hacker thing, gives it back and then suits up and fights against a giant monster thing. Not to say I don't like Wonder Woman (She is one of my favorite Superheroes of all time who showed not only can woman kick a** but they also don't need to be ashamed of their sexuality or gender) but she wasn't really that helpful to the plot and just brought in to expand the universe which was well done through Lex's superhuman hunting files. Also, the post-apocalyptic scene that was just a dream could have been cut but nothing is perfect except movies like Citizen Kane which isn't a lot of fun to watch cause it is too perfect. So to summarize, the theatrical cut is bad, the ultimate cut is Amazing and the other cut is meh. Please give it a second chance because it deserves it and save a good director from losing grace because of something he didn't do."
"I really liked it, don't know what all the hate is about. I'm actually a Marvel fan from when I was 7 or so, but Superman and Batman together in 1 movie? Just great. And personally I like Ben Affleck even better than Christian Bale as Batman. So just watch and enjoy, I know I did!"

"That's right. We have been waiting for these two heroes to finally meet and fight against each other. This movie is so good in both plot and special effects.Henry Cavill and Ben Affleck have performed well in their acting stages. They are the best superhero actors and they have filmed their fighting scenes very well. The movie starts to show the conflict between the lives of the heroes and now they have blamed each other for it. This movie is amazing and sets up a good plot for Dawn Justice."

"Actually...I didn't know what to expect. When you see Wonder Woman, you know it will be off of Wonder Woman and off of a Wonder Woman story, but with Batman V Superman, I was like, \"hmmmm, so who is this about?\" It was pretty obvious that it would feature many characters, but I thought the introduction to Batman was amazing. Ben Affleck nailed the part, not only as Batman but also as Bruce Wayne. He is my Batman. Henry Cavill continued to be super as the Man of Steel. And he is my Super - Man. A dark story? Yes, without a doubt. Could it have had a few more jokes? Sure. But not all movies or stories need to have jokes when certain events are serious. I really hope people can see this review and take another look at the movie, because, I loved it. I really hope the ratings can go up, eventually. And P.S, this movie is the perfect set up to Justice League."

"This film is crucial to the extended universe that DC is trying to build, but it feels highly derivative of better stories and continues to demonstrate the misuse of the iconic characters mentioned in the title. Plus Jesse Eisenberg feels wildly mis-casted."

"I'll start by making it clear I have only ever seen the Ultimate Edition. I'm aware of what was cut out for the theatrical release, so I will concede up front that most of the criticisms about pacing, editing, and missing bits of plot at release were merited.With that caveat out of the way, I must reiterate that this was bar-none the boldest superhero movie I have ever seen. To me, it was arguably the best as well, though \"best\" shouldn't be taken to mean \"most enjoyable.\" That honor easily goes to \"Thor: Ragnarok.\" What makes BvS stand out among other films in the genre is that it takes two characters who have been done to death since the 1970s and brings them up to date. I recently tried to watch \"Superman: The Movie\" for the first time in a number of years, and while it was still good and Reeves will always be iconic, I just couldn't take it seriously. I'll put it this way: If the story in BvS was \"stupid\" in your view but Superman turning back time by spinning the earth backward on its axis didn't seem like one of the dumbest things you have ever seen -in any movie from any genre- to the extent that it outright ruins the movie for you, then your opinion about BvS isn't worth much. Nostalgic bias was always going to be a problem for this movie, and the way people reacted to and reviewed \"Man of Steel\" was telling in this regard.That brings me to Zack Snyder's take on Superman. You know, that guy whose status as the first extraterrestrial ever encountered by humanity was a total non-issue in the old movies. Apparently, Snyder has a similar view to my own in that his take on the Man of Steel makes his being an alien a core piece of his identity. He may look like any other (absurdly attractive) person, but he knows what he is, and that makes him perpetually uncertain of where he fits in this world. He is essentially good and really does care about people, but he struggles to truly empathize with the likes of us. To be human is to be frail, and that is not something he can easily relate to. This is the root of his conflict with Batman.Just as Clark struggles to genuinely relate to most people, Snyder's Batman either refuses to or otherwise just can't relate to Superman. He doesn't see him as anything but a threat regardless of Superman's clear good intentions. Remember, a small group of Kryptonians were able to bring humanity to the brink of extinction in less than a day, and Bruce Wayne is nothing if not a realist. He didn't know the guy from Kansas. He only knew the god from another world.While Batman's anger toward and fear of Superman are readily apparent from the start, Superman's inability to imagine things from Bruce Wayne's perspective only becomes truly apparent during their first real interaction. This reminded me of the animated version of the \"world's finest\" storyline, where Superman judges Batman harshly for using fear tactics and threats of violence (also, actual violence) to get the job done. Superman wasn't willing to consider what it would take for a human man to fight criminals and save innocents, or what that life would do to him over time. Just as Batman didn't see the guy from Kansas, Superman didn't see the man who lives his life trapped in one brutal, unthinkably traumatic moment (this was beautifully conveyed during the film's opening moments), and had spent his whole adult life bearing witness to humanity at its absolute worst.The conflict between these two characters is as old as human history. They want the same things, but they can't understand one another. So they fight. And what a fight it was.Watching a fight between, say, Captain America and Iron Man was, to me, more frustrating than anything because each understood the other's perspective perfectly. The fight between Batman and Superman in BvS was genuinely gut-wrenching, as intended, because they would have understood one another if either had tried. The whole sequence hilighted Batman's tactical prowess and ability to control a situation. Maybe the most badass thing about the fight was that it ended exactly where Batman planned. That brings me to the big elephant in the room named \"Martha.\"I can't recall exactly which YouTuber put it this way, but if you thought the \"save Martha\" exchange was about their mothers having the same name, you had your brain turned off. The brain-on people have explained this to death, but it bears repeating. This was the moment when Superman became humanized to Batman. He was about to die, and his only concern was for his adoptive human mother. He still believed that the man about to take his life would do the right thing. Even with the cowl on, there was no mistaking the look on Batman's face. It was the look of shame, guilt, and sudden uncertainty that says \"What am I doing?\" Turns out even the most brutal, angry version of Bruce Wayne is better than Tony Stark at knowing right from wrong. At knowing that he had gone too far.From there, the third act was a series of truly impressive (albeit mostly CGI) fight sequences, beginning with what I regard as the undisputed champion of Batman fights. Nothing in the Nolan movies (and especially nothing in the Burton movies) even came close. Go ahead, try to convince yourself that Batman and Bane taking turns punching one another in the face until Bane's mask broke was a good fight sequence. No, this was a fight straight out of \"Arkham Knight,\" and it was glorious. The battle against Doomsday really was one for the books. From the moment Wonder Woman arrived accompanied by the intense sounds of Tina Guo's electric cello to Superman's tragic, heroic death at the hands of Doomsday, I was glued to the screen. Sure, the mere presence of Doomsday spoiled the end to a degree, but watching the Man of Steel laboring to carry that kryptonite spear towards certain death was no less impactful. A brief word on Jesse Eisenberg's take on Lex Luthor. At least one other reviewer on this site already said it best when they pointed out that this was his origin story. If you consider his scheme objectively, he is actually one of the more formidable incarnations of the character. If we're lucky, we'll eventually get to see a Snyder Cut of \"Justice League\" and find out where this story was actually meant to go. For the record, Joss Whedon and Danny Elfman both should have said \"no\" to taking a dump on someone else's art."
"BATMAN V SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE brings a fantastic surprise to a smash-hit team-up with one of the worlds most beloved DC Comics' icons of all time. The movie delivers spectacular casting, and fantastic acting with different characters having their shine in each scenes.The story follows Clark Kent/Superman who becomes a threat, after the destruction in Metropolis in Man Of Steel.(2013). Batman/Bruce Wayne sees him as a threat and begins his war on Superman.The movie brings spectacular storytelling, it tells the complications of human against alien who are on the same side, and the first meeting of Batman and Superman. The story of Bruce Wayne, with his many years of The Caped Crusader, sends him on a spiral of \"out of control\", sheer anger, and builds tension to wanting to defeat the Man of Steel. Snyder has fantastically gave this storytelling an exciting nod to the comics.Lex Luthor, played by Jesse Einsberg, delivers a very interesting performance, but very differently by him showing is his \"origin\" before he becomes a bald foe to the Man of Steel. He shows that his love of \"god vs man\" terrorises mankind when he ultimately creates Doomsday, and Batman realises Superman's inner heroism.It packs so many great \"out of nowhere\" excitement, including a first-look of the fearful Wonder Woman a.k.a. Diana Prince, played by Gal Gadot, and a fresh-new glimpse of the superhero DC canon: The Justice League.WATCH THIS MOVIE! The critics are out of their mind. It's a fun-packed action adventure which still keeps the movie enjoyable until it's final minutes of the movie. It's a FANTASTIC MOVIE! BEN AFFLECK AS BATMAN... is Incredible!A 10/10 overall!"
"I want to go on record as saying that this is a truly thrilling cinematic experience in so many ways. If pressed, I guess I could acknowledge that there were a couple ... let's say \"clumsy\" moments. And in a film that runs to three hours, that hardly seems like a significant issue, certainly not enough to rate it with fewer than 9 stars.This film has everything. There is dramatic tension right from the start. There is a magnificent story arc that picks up quite seamlessly from 'Man of Steel' and propels the viewer not only into the life of Clark Kent/Superman but also of Bruce Wayne/Batman.The villain is no mere cartoon of a villain; he is truly thoroughly (and apparently irrevocably) diabolical. He is a psychopath, and you wish for his death over and over and over. You want Superman to reduce him to ash with the power of his eyes.I have read a number of viewers' reviews, and it seems that the people who disliked the film / gave it a low rating had rather unfair and unrealistic expectations of it. That is, their own prejudices about how the plot could/should unfold or what the character development could/should be, etc. ruined the film for them. And that is a shame.My thought is: I settle into my seat, wait for the lights to dim, and then I wait to be transported by the film. I accept it, lock, stock, and barrel.As another reviewer remarked, I love how the film begins from the point of view of Bruce Wayne as he is among people on the ground who have fallen victim to the attack of Zod and the other Kryptonians.Why would Bruce Wayne not like Superman? Why would the good people of Earth hurl insults at Superman and burn him in effigy (on the news)? Because the good people of Earth just got catapulted into a new reality in which there are not only extraterrestrial beings (surprise!) but they are also superman! And a group of them are hell-bent on destroying humankind and taking the planet for themselves.It is difficult to see Superman as separate from the whole Kryptonian Krew.It seems that many moviegoers forgot that Bruce Wayne is also human. Sure, he's a hero, but he is flawed.. Just like the rest of us. He is a vigilante, after all.He has let his vigilantism get the better of him. HE is actually the one working outside the boundaries of the law, not Superman. It is the clear head of Alfred that shows us that he has gone into a rather dark place, that he has not seen what is really going on (in Luthor's scheme), and so he chooses to embark on his own scheme scheme to take out the alien invader. He is (allegedly) thinking of the future: if he wipes out the all-powerful alien, then it can't turn on humankind in the future. At least, he convinces himself of that.A philosophical question is raised in the film: should Clark Kent have remained a simple man from Kansas and never have become the Superman? Should he just let people die and let calamities happen? The question is answered for us in the character of Diana Prince/Wonder Woman. She withdrew from mankind (her exact words) and just sat around watching. Watching while people died horrible deaths all around her. So, should Superman have done the same? Do these special beings, these 'metahumans', have some kind of moral imperative to intervene, or should they be allowed to be regular people, too? It seems that humans want it both ways.It seems that humans are saying: \"Don't be a superalien ... except when I and my friends and family are in trouble. Then come save us.\""

"Batman v Superman: Ultimate Edition: If your looking for a quick, cheap thrill then you might not enjoy this film at the time. This movies theatrical version was butchered by WB and in doing so reshaped the story leaving numerous plot holes. So the Ultimate Edition is the full story and the one worth seeing. Watch 'Man of Steel' before seeing this movie. There is much to claw through here, so much so that the audience might easily find themselves exhausted from the overall aggression of the film. However, a lot of the story does work. The action is good, and the emotion feels real most of the time.This film is about Superman trying to become Superman. Trying to help the world, save people, find a place in this world not as an outcast, and yet is looked at has a threat by many. Superman is not from this world, yet He is trying to be human, find a place in this world, be excepted by earths people, and come into his destiny.This film is also about Batman being Batman for 20 years and losing faith in humanity, and fearing Superman, what Superman can do with his powers. Great film, great plot, great visuals. ---Yidioo"
"I didn't see the film in the theaters and just bought the \"Extended Edition \" on Amazon. I never properly saw Man of Steel- i think I rented it and watched it when already exhausted and fell asleep. I saw the mediocre user reviews and horrible reviews from critics of this film.They really have it wrong. This is the very best either Batman or Superman. It has a different take, on things. Much darker then earlier films even darker then the Christopher Nolan Batman films.First of all Christopher Nolan is an Executive Producer. So how bad could it be? I loved Sucker Punch and Zack Snyder was involved with that. So how bad could this be? Hans Zimmer did the music, so how bad could it be?I remember watching the old Superman TV shows and reading the Superman and Batman comics as a little kid and loved them, but i wouldn't call myself a \"fan boy\" of comic universes, like so many younger people today. As an older adult I will admit my favorite TV show of all time was Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but watched it on DVD only after it had finished. I saw the second of the Dark Knight series in the theater, but the other two, I watched on DVD. They were great, but not my favorite films like so many people. i also loved the first couple Superman and Batman films in the older series. Regardless, i was not waiting with baited breath to see Man of Steel or this one.I'm more of a serious film fan, who can watch Stanley Kubrick films over and over and my favorite films in the last twenty years, are Eyes Wide Shut and Intersteller, both of which i've watched multiple times.So, with that said, take it from me, the critics have this film very wrong, just as critics hated 2001: A Space Odyssey when it first came out. This film will have lasting appreciation.Surprised how much I liked Ben Afleck's Batman. it was hard to get into Henry Cavil's scrawnier looking Superman, but it grew on me. Amy Adams was great as Lois Lane, The Gal Gadol Wonder Women was amazing. Lex Luther was terrific, like Nolan's Joker. Jeremy Irons was the best Alfred ever. Holly Hunter and Diane Lane was good too. The movie had bad reviews but made a billion dollars. Hopefully everyone buys the Ultimate Edition and it breaks sales records and the film is re-appreciated. I have no idea what scenes this Ultimate Edition added, but it is pretty perfect. Now I can't wait for Wonder Woman and the Justice League and as soon as I finish writing this am going to watch Man of Steal. I'm into it now!I can only surmise that the bad reviews stem from too much expectations of the rigid fan boy types and the radical changes in tone, we see in this film.Total masterpiece of cinema, but I have a few criticisms. There are a few hollow scenes of typical Idiot cops and authorities getting everything wrong in a cliché type way and it has a few filler scenes of that type and a few moments here and there that felt rushed and cheesy. Maybe not everything restored into the Ultimate Edition should have been. I wish there had been more Kevin Costner scenes."

"The whole entire Batman V Superman movie was great and yes even though it felt slow to the majority of the people who watched it but to me I enjoyed every part and every scene of Batman V Superman and when it got to the fight scenes both batman VS Superman and the Doomsday fight it brought so much drama, intensity, and epic performances. So with that being said I give this movie a good 10/10 because it really did go to my expectations and it brought a powerful performance and a powerful yet epic introduction to the upcoming Justice League."

"When I first wrote a review for this movie a year ago exclaiming my excitement for the film, I had been high off a fresh dose of live-action DC superheroes playing out the beloved comic book stories that I had grown up on. It was all playing out before my eyes and coming to life. After a few months had passed, I began to notice things about the movie that I disliked: little gaps in the story, things that didn't add up, etc. My original rating of a 10 / 10 dropped to an 8 /10. But today it has gone back up to a 10. The extended version of the film not only rectifies the gaps but also silences critics.Many claimed that the movie was too dark or that it just didn't make sense. To those people, I say: \"Pick up a comic book!\" Many of the critics of this particular film were part of the superhero bandwagon that formed when Marvel began its spree of Avengers-related films. In fact, its estimated that over 60% of people who go to see 'superhero' genre films have never picked up a comic book in their life. I would argue that similar numbers could figure to those which view the CW televised DC Universe shows. People complain that DC comics is just too dark but the fact is that these movies are based upon actual comics which are meant to be dark (ex: The Dark Knight Returns, Injustice, etc.). Its like complaining that Game of Thrones (the TV series) sucks because they kill off too many characters. Read the books! Its frustrating to see such a beautiful work of art like Batman V Superman criticized by those ignorant to its universe and its meaning. This movie is in fact a catalyst that opens numerous doorways and leaves true fans in awe of the possibilities for future movies. But regardless of whether or not people choose to educate themselves, this film's DVD/Blu-ray extended version puts the theater release to shame. All of the plot holes and gaps are filled in 30 minutes of extended footage scattered throughout the film. The movie ultimately becomes more complete and people will wish that the movie had shown the full 3 hours of footage in its theatrical debut. As a major DC comics fan, I will of course pick up on things that a comics fan would not, but someone who does not read comics would learn to appreciate this film in its entirety with the extended version. Get your hands on a copy today or find it on Netflix or the internet somewhere!"

"I ignored the bad reviews and watched anyways. This film had a lot to live up to after Civil War was released and I went into this film expecting the worst. It ended up to be the best Superhero film of 2016 to me. One complaint was that this film was more concerned about universe building than telling a great story than Civil War but for me it was the other way around; Civil War felt like a build up to something else and to be honest, I felt that way when I saw the other MCU films. Batman vs Superman however not only had a great story, but it also felt a lot more consistent than Civil War. This film was way more diverse with the cast than the MCU but unlike the MCU, I felt like this film doesn't go overboard with the SJW stuff like the MCU films or The Star Wars Sequel films do. The Visuals were AMAZING, The Score by Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL was AMAZING as well, The Tone is just right as I actually felt for the characters emotionally, The Cinematography kept my eyes glued to the screen, and the script felt really Intelligent and Complex and despite people calling the writing confusing, I was able to piece it together with no problem whatsoever. This film is similar to Empire Strikes back in terms of popularity so over time after the other movies are released, this movie would probably be more popular.This film was way better than I Expected and deserves another chance.

"Its shame to see what critics and marvel fans did to this movie and targeted Zack Snyder for it. I have seen this movie more than 25 times till date. And i enjoy this movie as much as i enjoyed the first time. The fans who have read DC comics, wouldn't be disappointed in this movie. Its dark movie, yes it is. Because the title shows the intense situation at hand. Two superheroes about to rip each other apart for whatever reasons that brought them to this stage. Yes it had to be dark and intense.Only marvel can be stupid enough to show an alien invasion where humans are loosing the battle and the super heroes are cracking jokes while battles as if they are playing ping pong. a person playing Call of Duty game is more serious while playing than the marvel heroes fighting aliens."

"Last week some news came out from somebody online who had claimed to have seen a finished version of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. If you were like me, you've been leery of checking it out because you weren't sure how much might actually be true. Now Zack Snyder has spoken out about the spoiler-filled post, although his response doesn't really clear anything up.In a word, to MTV, he called the post \"hilarious,which might imply that he's saying that it's mostly, if not entirely, untrue. That might be the case, but then again he could have just said it was untrue and he didn't say that. What he did say, however, is that he doesn't like spoilers. While this may seem odd for the director who's most recent trailer appeared to give away the entire movie, Snyder says that's not the case. Even if you've seen the trailer, you can rest easy, as there is much more we have not seen in then finished film. Says Snyder I have the benefit of seeing the movie. It's cool that think it's too much, and I appreciate people not wanting to know, but there's plenty that they don't know. There's a lot of movie that's not in the trailer. In the process of calling the Batman v Superman Reddit review hilarious, Snyder goes on to talk about how he hates it when spoilers come out. The director would much rather that fans see the movie mostly blind. While he understands that some fans may wish to find the answers before hand, he wants his movies to be mysteries going in. If you're, as an audience member, exploring these articles, looking for answers to questions that you have, maybe you're okay with knowing before you go. It's like an individual taste. But like I said, I want people to see the movie without knowing.Spoilers are a topic that mean different things to different people. While most try to avoid them to some degree, the need to solve the mystery is a nearly universal human experience. We have an inclination to want to know the truth, even while also wanting to be surprised. For most of us getting some information is good, but getting all the information is bad, of course, only getting the details that you want can be difficult."
"The theatrical is choppy, poorly edited, hard to follow, with some really good moments mixed in their. The extended is much more fluent and is much easier to follow, it does have a long runtime, which might make it seem a bit dragging on, but if you like long films done right, like Lord of the Rings, you will like this movie as long as you get into the characters and story. Speaking of which, the story starts out perfectly showing Bruce Wayne as a character, and it is very powerful. There are several moments in this movie that are powerful, emotional, and shocking. Characters. Batman is my favorite fictional character of all time, and believe me when I say, Ben Affleck as Batman was perfect, he had the charisma, the anger, and the look of being through some bad stuff Gal Gadot also does perfect as Wonder Woman, but if you want to really see how good she does, go watch the Wonder Woman movie. Henry Call as Superman. I really don't like it when people say Christopher Reeves is better. Don't get me wrong, Reeves does great, but can you imagine him as Superman in this movie? I wouldn't like it. It would be like Adam West playing Batman in The Dark Knight. Henry Cavill does great in this role, I can say everything about him as I said with Ben Affleck. Jesse Eisenberg as Luthor. I thought it was different in a good way. I've heard a criticism for him as being too much like Joker, but is that a bad thing? Joker is my favorite villain, so to see Superman have an enemy that crazy, but still hold the values Luthor needs to be Luthor, I think it is great. The thing I thought this movie was lacking in the first and second acts was humor, at least good humor. If there was more humor, I would've given this movie a ten because it would give a more relaxing feel to the parts that needed it. All in all though, this movie was awesome, it had powerful moments, it was badass, and just plain fun. It had a great story arc and does its job very well."

"*I will be talking about the Ultimate Edition of the film* This was one of the most anticipated CBM of all time. Ever since the arrival and subsequent success of Marvel's The Avengers people have wondered when will DC launch its own cinematic universe, one of the main reasons being the opportunity to finally see titans such as Batman and Superman share the screen together: the ultimate nerd dream. On 2016, the moment finally came for BvS to be released AND.. it performed poorly. Not only did critical reception left a lot to be desired, but fan reactions where surprisingly split after its cinematic debut. People either loved it and called Zack a genius, or hated it and called him a hack. Me, personally, I found myself with middle of the road feelings, for sure, but more leaning towards the negative side with subsequent viewings. The theatrical cut of the film showcased amazing performances, incredible visuals, and action set pieces that seemed like comic book panels come to life, in a good way. However, when it comes to its narrative structure and more technical aspects like editing, the film was seriously flawed. More plot holes than Age of Ultron, questionable character decisions, random editing that lacked cohesion and focus, and forced dramatic moments that lacked any impact because the attempts at character development ranged from limited to nonexistent, especially when it comes to Superman's character. I thought it was a 5/10 movie at best. As such, I was kind of skeptical about the idea of a 30 minute longer version. I say kind of because I know how Zack works. I remember Watchmen being vastly improved with its director's cut, so in a way I was expecting BvS to perform in a similar manner, but I also feared those 30 minutes wold be just there to amplify action and discredit storytelling issues. Oh boy, I'm so glad I was proved wrong. The ultimate cut of the film was infuriating, but not because it was awful, but because it questions the sanity of WB executives and editors and makes you wonder what were they thinking during the editing process. What I got out of the Ultimate Edition was a thought-provoking deconstruction of two very iconic superheroes that gave spotlight to the struggles both of them face when they aren't fighting crime. What I got was an extremely well produced character study on both Batman and Superman in a cynical world, a world dangerously close to our own. We meet Batman as a ruthless, worn out hero that has seen the failure behind his ideals and witnessed some truly horrifying things in his life. Superman, on the other hand, is portrayed as a godlike figure that seeks to do good in the world, but finds himself emotionally conflicted once he realized that every good deed he does leaves behind a trail of destruction (most of it due to Luthor's antics). In my opinion, this is a hugely original approach, one that distances itself from the rest of the competition and delivers a dark, somber, yet relevant superhero movie that understands both characters and gives them real human struggles to deal with. I felt invested in both of them, and hoped that by the end of the film both could find a way to redeem themselves. Their character arcs were very well established during the first two acts of the movie, and by the time we get to the titular climactic battle the emotion behind the jaw-dropping action is intensified. Lex Luthor as a villain was also given more time to develop with this new edition. One of the main criticisms with the original version was the fact that his plan relied too much on conveniences, and the character's mannerisms and mad-scientist attitude was annoying, and that goes without saying his motivations were unclear. Not only do we spend more time understanding his hate for any godlike figure and thus his hatred for Superman, but the added scenes allowed us to witness his entire plan come to fruition. It sells the cold, manipulative, calculating attributes of his comic counterpart. The acting is spot on. Every actor owns his/her role, from Cavill's Superman, to Ben Affleck as Batman, Eisenberg as Luthor, and Gadot as Wonder Woman, whose scenes are brief, but are more than enough to sell the strong and ferocious warrior that she is. Cinematography is stunning, and miles above that of Man of Steel's. And the soundtrack by Zimmer and Junkie XL? Perfect, just perfect. When it comes to flaws, the film still has some of those. The Martha moment, while serving as a pivotal character moment for Batman, felt off in execution, and its understandable that many people got mad at it. If your main complaint about BvS the first time around was its bleak tone and subject matter, this film is still not for you. I understand most were expecting to see the heroes being the most iconic versions of themselves, clashing in an elongated battle and evoking the same feelings The Avengers gave audiences back in 2012. In that sense, the film will remain divisive, but at least I have the comfort of saying that, at the very least, the film is competently made."

"This film was amazing. Ben Affleck was easily the best part of this movie, he brought his a-game as Batman. The chemistry between Affleck & Irons was outstanding. Gal Gadot did a great job as Wonder Woman. The fight between Batman & Superman was awesome. The final fight with Doomsday was outstanding in every way possible. However, there is only one problem with this film and that's Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor. He was sadly missed cast in this role, but then again it's really the fault of Warner Bros. Studios. Overall, this film deliver on almost every level. I highly recommend that you watch the extended version of this film."

"I know I know. I saw it in theaters too, and felt like it could've been so much better. While the Batman element was good, the narrative felt fractured, and the third act was just one long stunt scene. Superman was relegated to a supporting character, and other characters didn't get a chance to shine. And then I chanced on the ultimate cut. Calling it 30 mins of \"extra\" footage is unfair to Zack Snyder because it's exactly these 30 mins that makes the movie a worthy one. What I can say about the theatrical cut is this - It had the blockbuster elements - music, visuals, stunts, CGI. But, it lacked the human elements. The first 20 mins of the movie had it, but not after that. The extended cut in comparison has a flow to the narrative. There are no disjointed scenes, everything flows smoothly, and there's connective tissue. Superman gets to spend some time with his father, and mother. Clark Kent does some investigative journalism. Superman helps the people after the blast. Lois Lane doesn't jump to conclusions, she gets to the bottom of the crime. Lex Luthor apparently had a coherent plan - everything is explained pretty well. Wonder Woman was already good, so there's no change there :) Also, the \"Martha\" scene seems better executed, because it is a few seconds longer, and there's time to breathe it in. So, here's my take on this movie - The theatrical cut was junk. Get the Bluray for ultimate edition, and you shall not be disappointed. I've seen it so many more times now, and it's the definitive cut. It is the movie we deserve. It's a unique take on Batman, and Superman. It's a gritty take on the superhero movie genre, and definitely the best DCEU movie, and the best DC movie since The Dark Knight.P.S. Yes it's dark. We're adults, and we should appreciate mature film making without intentionally silly moments. It attempts to be philosophical, and something deep instead of just trying to make you chuckle."

"This is one of the best superhero movies ever made. Zack Snyder is a magician behind the camera.The reason behind so many complaints is the fact that Warner Bros. marketed this movie as a fight between Batman and Superman. That's not what it is. It's a movie about the origins of the Justice League.The cinematography, the acting and the score are all second to none. This film is phenomenal.P.S: watch the 3 hour extended cut that Snyder intended you to see, not the 2 and a half hour movie that Warner Bros. decided would be better for theaters."

"I don't care what the critics say, this is a very well-done movie. I'll start my review by listing what I like about the movie.1.) Ben Affleck is the best batman to me and it is not close. He pulls off the role of an aging batman extremely well. Also, Zack Snyder's vision of batman is legit. I have always hated batman up until this adaptation of him. Instead of being a conflicted and idealistic batman, this batman is dark, gritty, and 100% a badass. His equipment is decked out with machine guns and he has no aversion to killing people. In fact, he probably kills about 50 criminal by the time this movie is over. The warehouse scene is the coolest batman scene in any movie.2.) The development of a grudge between batman and superman is pulled off flawlessly. It actually makes sense why batman dislikes superman. Then, when they do fight it is about the coolest thing you can expect to see from a superhero film. 3.) I disagree with a lot of people about Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor. In my opinion, he played his role to perfection. 4.) B v S sets up Wonder Woman and Justice League with Gal Gadot's cameo as Wonder Woman and short clips of Aquaman, the Flash, and Cyborg. B v S is one of my favorite superhero films and rewatching it never gets old."

"The theatrical cut of this film is garbage which is why I rated it eight stars instead of nine. The first time I watched this film I didn't like it (not straight out hate but didn't like). Character motivations didn't make any sense, Lex was annoying as s***, editing was sloppy, and it was overly dark and broody for an action superhero movie. A year + a half, five Marvel films, a ton of bad reviews and a Justice League later a thought popped into my head: \"what if I watched BVS again\". This time I didn't have trailers ruining the best moments, I only vaguely remembered the film, and I was conditioned to look at it negatively but something unexpected happened: I actually loved it. Superman was just a normal person that tried to make a difference cause he could that others imposed their own beliefs on. Lex Luthor was a genius that couldn't stand his powerlessness compared to Superman or more accurately a super being. As Alfred said \"The fever, the rage, the feeling of powerlessness that turns good men... cruel\" and you see the same thought process in Batman. Batman, just like Lex Luthor feels powerless in the midst of a god-being and just like Lex he attempts to destroy him so he can get his sense of power back but unlike Lex, Batman learns something. I what is one of the corniest lines of the movie Superman says, \"Martha\" when he knows he can't win against Batman in a late desperate attempt to save his mother. Not only does this name connect with Bruce Wayne but it also shows what really matters to a man of steel: it isn't power, it isn't fame or anything else, it is his Mother and on a broader scale it is people. Lex (who doesn't care about people at all) knows he doesn't have the power so he creates something from his blood and the remains of Zod: A Doomsday for Superman. Not only does this film have depth but it also doesn't always explain it to you which is rare in a blockbuster action superhero flick normally cater to semi-comic book fans and people that want to shove popcorn in their mouths. This film rewards you for really noticing the details while still having massive explosions. One of my favorites is how Lex has all of Batman's branded killed which is why he isn't afraid of the branding at the end or Grandma's Peach Tea as a way of scaring the s*** out of someone. Of course, this film isn't perfect and I do have personal dislikes. The Batman V Superman fight was slow and pretty boring especially after watching such an amazing fight in Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 2 (If you haven't watched the animated Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 1 and 2 you are sorely missing out on something fantastic). Also, the addition of Wonder Woman who pretty much steals a hacker thing, gives it back and then suits up and fights against a giant monster thing. Not to say I don't like Wonder Woman (She is one of my favorite Superheroes of all time who showed not only can woman kick a** but they also don't need to be ashamed of their sexuality or gender) but she wasn't really that helpful to the plot and just brought in to expand the universe which was well done through Lex's superhuman hunting files. Also, the post-apocalyptic scene that was just a dream could have been cut but nothing is perfect except movies like Citizen Kane which isn't a lot of fun to watch cause it is too perfect. So to summarize, the theatrical cut is bad, the ultimate cut is Amazing and the other cut is meh. Please give it a second chance because it deserves it and save a good director from losing grace because of something he didn't do."
"I really liked it, don't know what all the hate is about. I'm actually a Marvel fan from when I was 7 or so, but Superman and Batman together in 1 movie? Just great. And personally I like Ben Affleck even better than Christian Bale as Batman. So just watch and enjoy, I know I did!"

"That's right. We have been waiting for these two heroes to finally meet and fight against each other. This movie is so good in both plot and special effects.Henry Cavill and Ben Affleck have performed well in their acting stages. They are the best superhero actors and they have filmed their fighting scenes very well. The movie starts to show the conflict between the lives of the heroes and now they have blamed each other for it. This movie is amazing and sets up a good plot for Dawn Justice."

"Actually...I didn't know what to expect. When you see Wonder Woman, you know it will be off of Wonder Woman and off of a Wonder Woman story, but with Batman V Superman, I was like, \"hmmmm, so who is this about?\" It was pretty obvious that it would feature many characters, but I thought the introduction to Batman was amazing. Ben Affleck nailed the part, not only as Batman but also as Bruce Wayne. He is my Batman. Henry Cavill continued to be super as the Man of Steel. And he is my Super - Man. A dark story? Yes, without a doubt. Could it have had a few more jokes? Sure. But not all movies or stories need to have jokes when certain events are serious. I really hope people can see this review and take another look at the movie, because, I loved it. I really hope the ratings can go up, eventually. And P.S, this movie is the perfect set up to Justice League."

"I'll start by making it clear I have only ever seen the Ultimate Edition. I'm aware of what was cut out for the theatrical release, so I will concede up front that most of the criticisms about pacing, editing, and missing bits of plot at release were merited.With that caveat out of the way, I must reiterate that this was bar-none the boldest superhero movie I have ever seen. To me, it was arguably the best as well, though \"best\" shouldn't be taken to mean \"most enjoyable.\" That honor easily goes to \"Thor: Ragnarok.\" What makes BvS stand out among other films in the genre is that it takes two characters who have been done to death since the 1970s and brings them up to date. I recently tried to watch \"Superman: The Movie\" for the first time in a number of years, and while it was still good and Reeves will always be iconic, I just couldn't take it seriously. I'll put it this way: If the story in BvS was \"stupid\" in your view but Superman turning back time by spinning the earth backward on its axis didn't seem like one of the dumbest things you have ever seen -in any movie from any genre- to the extent that it outright ruins the movie for you, then your opinion about BvS isn't worth much. Nostalgic bias was always going to be a problem for this movie, and the way people reacted to and reviewed \"Man of Steel\" was telling in this regard.That brings me to Zack Snyder's take on Superman. You know, that guy whose status as the first extraterrestrial ever encountered by humanity was a total non-issue in the old movies. Apparently, Snyder has a similar view to my own in that his take on the Man of Steel makes his being an alien a core piece of his identity. He may look like any other (absurdly attractive) person, but he knows what he is, and that makes him perpetually uncertain of where he fits in this world. He is essentially good and really does care about people, but he struggles to truly empathize with the likes of us. To be human is to be frail, and that is not something he can easily relate to. This is the root of his conflict with Batman.Just as Clark struggles to genuinely relate to most people, Snyder's Batman either refuses to or otherwise just can't relate to Superman. He doesn't see him as anything but a threat regardless of Superman's clear good intentions. Remember, a small group of Kryptonians were able to bring humanity to the brink of extinction in less than a day, and Bruce Wayne is nothing if not a realist. He didn't know the guy from Kansas. He only knew the god from another world.While Batman's anger toward and fear of Superman are readily apparent from the start, Superman's inability to imagine things from Bruce Wayne's perspective only becomes truly apparent during their first real interaction. This reminded me of the animated version of the \"world's finest\" storyline, where Superman judges Batman harshly for using fear tactics and threats of violence (also, actual violence) to get the job done. Superman wasn't willing to consider what it would take for a human man to fight criminals and save innocents, or what that life would do to him over time. Just as Batman didn't see the guy from Kansas, Superman didn't see the man who lives his life trapped in one brutal, unthinkably traumatic moment (this was beautifully conveyed during the film's opening moments), and had spent his whole adult life bearing witness to humanity at its absolute worst.The conflict between these two characters is as old as human history. They want the same things, but they can't understand one another. So they fight. And what a fight it was.Watching a fight between, say, Captain America and Iron Man was, to me, more frustrating than anything because each understood the other's perspective perfectly. The fight between Batman and Superman in BvS was genuinely gut-wrenching, as intended, because they would have understood one another if either had tried. The whole sequence hilighted Batman's tactical prowess and ability to control a situation. Maybe the most badass thing about the fight was that it ended exactly where Batman planned. That brings me to the big elephant in the room named \"Martha.\"I can't recall exactly which YouTuber put it this way, but if you thought the \"save Martha\" exchange was about their mothers having the same name, you had your brain turned off. The brain-on people have explained this to death, but it bears repeating. This was the moment when Superman became humanized to Batman. He was about to die, and his only concern was for his adoptive human mother. He still believed that the man about to take his life would do the right thing. Even with the cowl on, there was no mistaking the look on Batman's face. It was the look of shame, guilt, and sudden uncertainty that says \"What am I doing?\" Turns out even the most brutal, angry version of Bruce Wayne is better than Tony Stark at knowing right from wrong. At knowing that he had gone too far.From there, the third act was a series of truly impressive (albeit mostly CGI) fight sequences, beginning with what I regard as the undisputed champion of Batman fights. Nothing in the Nolan movies (and especially nothing in the Burton movies) even came close. Go ahead, try to convince yourself that Batman and Bane taking turns punching one another in the face until Bane's mask broke was a good fight sequence. No, this was a fight straight out of \"Arkham Knight,\" and it was glorious. The battle against Doomsday really was one for the books. From the moment Wonder Woman arrived accompanied by the intense sounds of Tina Guo's electric cello to Superman's tragic, heroic death at the hands of Doomsday, I was glued to the screen. Sure, the mere presence of Doomsday spoiled the end to a degree, but watching the Man of Steel laboring to carry that kryptonite spear towards certain death was no less impactful. A brief word on Jesse Eisenberg's take on Lex Luthor. At least one other reviewer on this site already said it best when they pointed out that this was his origin story. If you consider his scheme objectively, he is actually one of the more formidable incarnations of the character. If we're lucky, we'll eventually get to see a Snyder Cut of \"Justice League\" and find out where this story was actually meant to go. For the record, Joss Whedon and Danny Elfman both should have said \"no\" to taking a dump on someone else's art."
"BATMAN V SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE brings a fantastic surprise to a smash-hit team-up with one of the worlds most beloved DC Comics' icons of all time. The movie delivers spectacular casting, and fantastic acting with different characters having their shine in each scenes.The story follows Clark Kent/Superman who becomes a threat, after the destruction in Metropolis in Man Of Steel.(2013). Batman/Bruce Wayne sees him as a threat and begins his war on Superman.The movie brings spectacular storytelling, it tells the complications of human against alien who are on the same side, and the first meeting of Batman and Superman. The story of Bruce Wayne, with his many years of The Caped Crusader, sends him on a spiral of \"out of control\", sheer anger, and builds tension to wanting to defeat the Man of Steel. Snyder has fantastically gave this storytelling an exciting nod to the comics.Lex Luthor, played by Jesse Einsberg, delivers a very interesting performance, but very differently by him showing is his \"origin\" before he becomes a bald foe to the Man of Steel. He shows that his love of \"god vs man\" terrorises mankind when he ultimately creates Doomsday, and Batman realises Superman's inner heroism.It packs so many great \"out of nowhere\" excitement, including a first-look of the fearful Wonder Woman a.k.a. Diana Prince, played by Gal Gadot, and a fresh-new glimpse of the superhero DC canon: The Justice League.WATCH THIS MOVIE! The critics are out of their mind. It's a fun-packed action adventure which still keeps the movie enjoyable until it's final minutes of the movie. It's a FANTASTIC MOVIE! BEN AFFLECK AS BATMAN... is Incredible!A 10/10 overall!"
"I want to go on record as saying that this is a truly thrilling cinematic experience in so many ways. If pressed, I guess I could acknowledge that there were a couple ... let's say \"clumsy\" moments. And in a film that runs to three hours, that hardly seems like a significant issue, certainly not enough to rate it with fewer than 9 stars.This film has everything. There is dramatic tension right from the start. There is a magnificent story arc that picks up quite seamlessly from 'Man of Steel' and propels the viewer not only into the life of Clark Kent/Superman but also of Bruce Wayne/Batman.The villain is no mere cartoon of a villain; he is truly thoroughly (and apparently irrevocably) diabolical. He is a psychopath, and you wish for his death over and over and over. You want Superman to reduce him to ash with the power of his eyes.I have read a number of viewers' reviews, and it seems that the people who disliked the film / gave it a low rating had rather unfair and unrealistic expectations of it. That is, their own prejudices about how the plot could/should unfold or what the character development could/should be, etc. ruined the film for them. And that is a shame.My thought is: I settle into my seat, wait for the lights to dim, and then I wait to be transported by the film. I accept it, lock, stock, and barrel.As another reviewer remarked, I love how the film begins from the point of view of Bruce Wayne as he is among people on the ground who have fallen victim to the attack of Zod and the other Kryptonians.Why would Bruce Wayne not like Superman? Why would the good people of Earth hurl insults at Superman and burn him in effigy (on the news)? Because the good people of Earth just got catapulted into a new reality in which there are not only extraterrestrial beings (surprise!) but they are also superman! And a group of them are hell-bent on destroying humankind and taking the planet for themselves.It is difficult to see Superman as separate from the whole Kryptonian Krew.It seems that many moviegoers forgot that Bruce Wayne is also human. Sure, he's a hero, but he is flawed.. Just like the rest of us. He is a vigilante, after all.He has let his vigilantism get the better of him. HE is actually the one working outside the boundaries of the law, not Superman. It is the clear head of Alfred that shows us that he has gone into a rather dark place, that he has not seen what is really going on (in Luthor's scheme), and so he chooses to embark on his own scheme scheme to take out the alien invader. He is (allegedly) thinking of the future: if he wipes out the all-powerful alien, then it can't turn on humankind in the future. At least, he convinces himself of that.A philosophical question is raised in the film: should Clark Kent have remained a simple man from Kansas and never have become the Superman? Should he just let people die and let calamities happen? The question is answered for us in the character of Diana Prince/Wonder Woman. She withdrew from mankind (her exact words) and just sat around watching. Watching while people died horrible deaths all around her. So, should Superman have done the same? Do these special beings, these 'metahumans', have some kind of moral imperative to intervene, or should they be allowed to be regular people, too? It seems that humans want it both ways.It seems that humans are saying: \"Don't be a superalien ... except when I and my friends and family are in trouble. Then come save us.\""

"Batman v Superman: Ultimate Edition: If your looking for a quick, cheap thrill then you might not enjoy this film at the time. This movies theatrical version was butchered by WB and in doing so reshaped the story leaving numerous plot holes. So the Ultimate Edition is the full story and the one worth seeing. Watch 'Man of Steel' before seeing this movie. There is much to claw through here, so much so that the audience might easily find themselves exhausted from the overall aggression of the film. However, a lot of the story does work. The action is good, and the emotion feels real most of the time.This film is about Superman trying to become Superman. Trying to help the world, save people, find a place in this world not as an outcast, and yet is looked at has a threat by many. Superman is not from this world, yet He is trying to be human, find a place in this world, be excepted by earths people, and come into his destiny.This film is also about Batman being Batman for 20 years and losing faith in humanity, and fearing Superman, what Superman can do with his powers. Great film, great plot, great visuals. ---Yidioo"
"I didn't see the film in the theaters and just bought the \"Extended Edition \" on Amazon. I never properly saw Man of Steel- i think I rented it and watched it when already exhausted and fell asleep. I saw the mediocre user reviews and horrible reviews from critics of this film.They really have it wrong. This is the very best either Batman or Superman. It has a different take, on things. Much darker then earlier films even darker then the Christopher Nolan Batman films.First of all Christopher Nolan is an Executive Producer. So how bad could it be? I loved Sucker Punch and Zack Snyder was involved with that. So how bad could this be? Hans Zimmer did the music, so how bad could it be?I remember watching the old Superman TV shows and reading the Superman and Batman comics as a little kid and loved them, but i wouldn't call myself a \"fan boy\" of comic universes, like so many younger people today. As an older adult I will admit my favorite TV show of all time was Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but watched it on DVD only after it had finished. I saw the second of the Dark Knight series in the theater, but the other two, I watched on DVD. They were great, but not my favorite films like so many people. i also loved the first couple Superman and Batman films in the older series. Regardless, i was not waiting with baited breath to see Man of Steel or this one.I'm more of a serious film fan, who can watch Stanley Kubrick films over and over and my favorite films in the last twenty years, are Eyes Wide Shut and Intersteller, both of which i've watched multiple times.So, with that said, take it from me, the critics have this film very wrong, just as critics hated 2001: A Space Odyssey when it first came out. This film will have lasting appreciation.Surprised how much I liked Ben Afleck's Batman. it was hard to get into Henry Cavil's scrawnier looking Superman, but it grew on me. Amy Adams was great as Lois Lane, The Gal Gadol Wonder Women was amazing. Lex Luther was terrific, like Nolan's Joker. Jeremy Irons was the best Alfred ever. Holly Hunter and Diane Lane was good too. The movie had bad reviews but made a billion dollars. Hopefully everyone buys the Ultimate Edition and it breaks sales records and the film is re-appreciated. I have no idea what scenes this Ultimate Edition added, but it is pretty perfect. Now I can't wait for Wonder Woman and the Justice League and as soon as I finish writing this am going to watch Man of Steal. I'm into it now!I can only surmise that the bad reviews stem from too much expectations of the rigid fan boy types and the radical changes in tone, we see in this film.Total masterpiece of cinema, but I have a few criticisms. There are a few hollow scenes of typical Idiot cops and authorities getting everything wrong in a cliché type way and it has a few filler scenes of that type and a few moments here and there that felt rushed and cheesy. Maybe not everything restored into the Ultimate Edition should have been. I wish there had been more Kevin Costner scenes."

"The whole entire Batman V Superman movie was great and yes even though it felt slow to the majority of the people who watched it but to me I enjoyed every part and every scene of Batman V Superman and when it got to the fight scenes both batman VS Superman and the Doomsday fight it brought so much drama, intensity, and epic performances. So with that being said I give this movie a good 10/10 because it really did go to my expectations and it brought a powerful performance and a powerful yet epic introduction to the upcoming Justice League."

"When I first wrote a review for this movie a year ago exclaiming my excitement for the film, I had been high off a fresh dose of live-action DC superheroes playing out the beloved comic book stories that I had grown up on. It was all playing out before my eyes and coming to life. After a few months had passed, I began to notice things about the movie that I disliked: little gaps in the story, things that didn't add up, etc. My original rating of a 10 / 10 dropped to an 8 /10. But today it has gone back up to a 10. The extended version of the film not only rectifies the gaps but also silences critics.Many claimed that the movie was too dark or that it just didn't make sense. To those people, I say: \"Pick up a comic book!\" Many of the critics of this particular film were part of the superhero bandwagon that formed when Marvel began its spree of Avengers-related films. In fact, its estimated that over 60% of people who go to see 'superhero' genre films have never picked up a comic book in their life. I would argue that similar numbers could figure to those which view the CW televised DC Universe shows. People complain that DC comics is just too dark but the fact is that these movies are based upon actual comics which are meant to be dark (ex: The Dark Knight Returns, Injustice, etc.). Its like complaining that Game of Thrones (the TV series) sucks because they kill off too many characters. Read the books! Its frustrating to see such a beautiful work of art like Batman V Superman criticized by those ignorant to its universe and its meaning. This movie is in fact a catalyst that opens numerous doorways and leaves true fans in awe of the possibilities for future movies. But regardless of whether or not people choose to educate themselves, this film's DVD/Blu-ray extended version puts the theater release to shame. All of the plot holes and gaps are filled in 30 minutes of extended footage scattered throughout the film. The movie ultimately becomes more complete and people will wish that the movie had shown the full 3 hours of footage in its theatrical debut. As a major DC comics fan, I will of course pick up on things that a comics fan would not, but someone who does not read comics would learn to appreciate this film in its entirety with the extended version. Get your hands on a copy today or find it on Netflix or the internet somewhere!"

"I ignored the bad reviews and watched anyways. This film had a lot to live up to after Civil War was released and I went into this film expecting the worst. It ended up to be the best Superhero film of 2016 to me. One complaint was that this film was more concerned about universe building than telling a great story than Civil War but for me it was the other way around; Civil War felt like a build up to something else and to be honest, I felt that way when I saw the other MCU films. Batman vs Superman however not only had a great story, but it also felt a lot more consistent than Civil War. This film was way more diverse with the cast than the MCU but unlike the MCU, I felt like this film doesn't go overboard with the SJW stuff like the MCU films or The Star Wars Sequel films do. The Visuals were AMAZING, The Score by Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL was AMAZING as well, The Tone is just right as I actually felt for the characters emotionally, The Cinematography kept my eyes glued to the screen, and the script felt really Intelligent and Complex and despite people calling the writing confusing, I was able to piece it together with no problem whatsoever. This film is similar to Empire Strikes back in terms of popularity so over time after the other movies are released, this movie would probably be more popular.This film was way better than I Expected and deserves another chance.

"Its shame to see what critics and marvel fans did to this movie and targeted Zack Snyder for it. I have seen this movie more than 25 times till date. And i enjoy this movie as much as i enjoyed the first time. The fans who have read DC comics, wouldn't be disappointed in this movie. Its dark movie, yes it is. Because the title shows the intense situation at hand. Two superheroes about to rip each other apart for whatever reasons that brought them to this stage. Yes it had to be dark and intense.Only marvel can be stupid enough to show an alien invasion where humans are loosing the battle and the super heroes are cracking jokes while battles as if they are playing ping pong. a person playing Call of Duty game is more serious while playing than the marvel heroes fighting aliens."

"Last week some news came out from somebody online who had claimed to have seen a finished version of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. If you were like me, you've been leery of checking it out because you weren't sure how much might actually be true. Now Zack Snyder has spoken out about the spoiler-filled post, although his response doesn't really clear anything up.In a word, to MTV, he called the post \"hilarious,which might imply that he's saying that it's mostly, if not entirely, untrue. That might be the case, but then again he could have just said it was untrue and he didn't say that. What he did say, however, is that he doesn't like spoilers. While this may seem odd for the director who's most recent trailer appeared to give away the entire movie, Snyder says that's not the case. Even if you've seen the trailer, you can rest easy, as there is much more we have not seen in then finished film. Says Snyder I have the benefit of seeing the movie. It's cool that think it's too much, and I appreciate people not wanting to know, but there's plenty that they don't know. There's a lot of movie that's not in the trailer. In the process of calling the Batman v Superman Reddit review hilarious, Snyder goes on to talk about how he hates it when spoilers come out. The director would much rather that fans see the movie mostly blind. While he understands that some fans may wish to find the answers before hand, he wants his movies to be mysteries going in. If you're, as an audience member, exploring these articles, looking for answers to questions that you have, maybe you're okay with knowing before you go. It's like an individual taste. But like I said, I want people to see the movie without knowing.Spoilers are a topic that mean different things to different people. While most try to avoid them to some degree, the need to solve the mystery is a nearly universal human experience. We have an inclination to want to know the truth, even while also wanting to be surprised. For most of us getting some information is good, but getting all the information is bad, of course, only getting the details that you want can be difficult."
"The theatrical is choppy, poorly edited, hard to follow, with some really good moments mixed in their. The extended is much more fluent and is much easier to follow, it does have a long runtime, which might make it seem a bit dragging on, but if you like long films done right, like Lord of the Rings, you will like this movie as long as you get into the characters and story. Speaking of which, the story starts out perfectly showing Bruce Wayne as a character, and it is very powerful. There are several moments in this movie that are powerful, emotional, and shocking. Characters. Batman is my favorite fictional character of all time, and believe me when I say, Ben Affleck as Batman was perfect, he had the charisma, the anger, and the look of being through some bad stuff Gal Gadot also does perfect as Wonder Woman, but if you want to really see how good she does, go watch the Wonder Woman movie. Henry Call as Superman. I really don't like it when people say Christopher Reeves is better. Don't get me wrong, Reeves does great, but can you imagine him as Superman in this movie? I wouldn't like it. It would be like Adam West playing Batman in The Dark Knight. Henry Cavill does great in this role, I can say everything about him as I said with Ben Affleck. Jesse Eisenberg as Luthor. I thought it was different in a good way. I've heard a criticism for him as being too much like Joker, but is that a bad thing? Joker is my favorite villain, so to see Superman have an enemy that crazy, but still hold the values Luthor needs to be Luthor, I think it is great. The thing I thought this movie was lacking in the first and second acts was humor, at least good humor. If there was more humor, I would've given this movie a ten because it would give a more relaxing feel to the parts that needed it. All in all though, this movie was awesome, it had powerful moments, it was badass, and just plain fun. It had a great story arc and does its job very well."

"*I will be talking about the Ultimate Edition of the film* This was one of the most anticipated CBM of all time. Ever since the arrival and subsequent success of Marvel's The Avengers people have wondered when will DC launch its own cinematic universe, one of the main reasons being the opportunity to finally see titans such as Batman and Superman share the screen together: the ultimate nerd dream. On 2016, the moment finally came for BvS to be released AND.. it performed poorly. Not only did critical reception left a lot to be desired, but fan reactions where surprisingly split after its cinematic debut. People either loved it and called Zack a genius, or hated it and called him a hack. Me, personally, I found myself with middle of the road feelings, for sure, but more leaning towards the negative side with subsequent viewings. The theatrical cut of the film showcased amazing performances, incredible visuals, and action set pieces that seemed like comic book panels come to life, in a good way. However, when it comes to its narrative structure and more technical aspects like editing, the film was seriously flawed. More plot holes than Age of Ultron, questionable character decisions, random editing that lacked cohesion and focus, and forced dramatic moments that lacked any impact because the attempts at character development ranged from limited to nonexistent, especially when it comes to Superman's character. I thought it was a 5/10 movie at best. As such, I was kind of skeptical about the idea of a 30 minute longer version. I say kind of because I know how Zack works. I remember Watchmen being vastly improved with its director's cut, so in a way I was expecting BvS to perform in a similar manner, but I also feared those 30 minutes wold be just there to amplify action and discredit storytelling issues. Oh boy, I'm so glad I was proved wrong. The ultimate cut of the film was infuriating, but not because it was awful, but because it questions the sanity of WB executives and editors and makes you wonder what were they thinking during the editing process. What I got out of the Ultimate Edition was a thought-provoking deconstruction of two very iconic superheroes that gave spotlight to the struggles both of them face when they aren't fighting crime. What I got was an extremely well produced character study on both Batman and Superman in a cynical world, a world dangerously close to our own. We meet Batman as a ruthless, worn out hero that has seen the failure behind his ideals and witnessed some truly horrifying things in his life. Superman, on the other hand, is portrayed as a godlike figure that seeks to do good in the world, but finds himself emotionally conflicted once he realized that every good deed he does leaves behind a trail of destruction (most of it due to Luthor's antics). In my opinion, this is a hugely original approach, one that distances itself from the rest of the competition and delivers a dark, somber, yet relevant superhero movie that understands both characters and gives them real human struggles to deal with. I felt invested in both of them, and hoped that by the end of the film both could find a way to redeem themselves. Their character arcs were very well established during the first two acts of the movie, and by the time we get to the titular climactic battle the emotion behind the jaw-dropping action is intensified. Lex Luthor as a villain was also given more time to develop with this new edition. One of the main criticisms with the original version was the fact that his plan relied too much on conveniences, and the character's mannerisms and mad-scientist attitude was annoying, and that goes without saying his motivations were unclear. Not only do we spend more time understanding his hate for any godlike figure and thus his hatred for Superman, but the added scenes allowed us to witness his entire plan come to fruition. It sells the cold, manipulative, calculating attributes of his comic counterpart. The acting is spot on. Every actor owns his/her role, from Cavill's Superman, to Ben Affleck as Batman, Eisenberg as Luthor, and Gadot as Wonder Woman, whose scenes are brief, but are more than enough to sell the strong and ferocious warrior that she is. Cinematography is stunning, and miles above that of Man of Steel's. And the soundtrack by Zimmer and Junkie XL? Perfect, just perfect. When it comes to flaws, the film still has some of those. The Martha moment, while serving as a pivotal character moment for Batman, felt off in execution, and its understandable that many people got mad at it. If your main complaint about BvS the first time around was its bleak tone and subject matter, this film is still not for you. I understand most were expecting to see the heroes being the most iconic versions of themselves, clashing in an elongated battle and evoking the same feelings The Avengers gave audiences back in 2012. In that sense, the film will remain divisive, but at least I have the comfort of saying that, at the very least, the film is competently made."

"This film was amazing. Ben Affleck was easily the best part of this movie, he brought his a-game as Batman. The chemistry between Affleck & Irons was outstanding. Gal Gadot did a great job as Wonder Woman. The fight between Batman & Superman was awesome. The final fight with Doomsday was outstanding in every way possible. However, there is only one problem with this film and that's Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor. He was sadly missed cast in this role, but then again it's really the fault of Warner Bros. Studios. Overall, this film deliver on almost every level. I highly recommend that you watch the extended version of this film."

"I know I know. I saw it in theaters too, and felt like it could've been so much better. While the Batman element was good, the narrative felt fractured, and the third act was just one long stunt scene. Superman was relegated to a supporting character, and other characters didn't get a chance to shine. And then I chanced on the ultimate cut. Calling it 30 mins of \"extra\" footage is unfair to Zack Snyder because it's exactly these 30 mins that makes the movie a worthy one. What I can say about the theatrical cut is this - It had the blockbuster elements - music, visuals, stunts, CGI. But, it lacked the human elements. The first 20 mins of the movie had it, but not after that. The extended cut in comparison has a flow to the narrative. There are no disjointed scenes, everything flows smoothly, and there's connective tissue. Superman gets to spend some time with his father, and mother. Clark Kent does some investigative journalism. Superman helps the people after the blast. Lois Lane doesn't jump to conclusions, she gets to the bottom of the crime. Lex Luthor apparently had a coherent plan - everything is explained pretty well. Wonder Woman was already good, so there's no change there :) Also, the \"Martha\" scene seems better executed, because it is a few seconds longer, and there's time to breathe it in. So, here's my take on this movie - The theatrical cut was junk. Get the Bluray for ultimate edition, and you shall not be disappointed. I've seen it so many more times now, and it's the definitive cut. It is the movie we deserve. It's a unique take on Batman, and Superman. It's a gritty take on the superhero movie genre, and definitely the best DCEU movie, and the best DC movie since The Dark Knight.P.S. Yes it's dark. We're adults, and we should appreciate mature film making without intentionally silly moments. It attempts to be philosophical, and something deep instead of just trying to make you chuckle."

"This is one of the best superhero movies ever made. Zack Snyder is a magician behind the camera.The reason behind so many complaints is the fact that Warner Bros. marketed this movie as a fight between Batman and Superman. That's not what it is. It's a movie about the origins of the Justice League.The cinematography, the acting and the score are all second to none. This film is phenomenal.P.S: watch the 3 hour extended cut that Snyder intended you to see, not the 2 and a half hour movie that Warner Bros. decided would be better for theaters."

"I don't care what the critics say, this is a very well-done movie. I'll start my review by listing what I like about the movie.1.) Ben Affleck is the best batman to me and it is not close. He pulls off the role of an aging batman extremely well. Also, Zack Snyder's vision of batman is legit. I have always hated batman up until this adaptation of him. Instead of being a conflicted and idealistic batman, this batman is dark, gritty, and 100% a badass. His equipment is decked out with machine guns and he has no aversion to killing people. In fact, he probably kills about 50 criminal by the time this movie is over. The warehouse scene is the coolest batman scene in any movie.2.) The development of a grudge between batman and superman is pulled off flawlessly. It actually makes sense why batman dislikes superman. Then, when they do fight it is about the coolest thing you can expect to see from a superhero film. 3.) I disagree with a lot of people about Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor. In my opinion, he played his role to perfection. 4.) B v S sets up Wonder Woman and Justice League with Gal Gadot's cameo as Wonder Woman and short clips of Aquaman, the Flash, and Cyborg. B v S is one of my favorite superhero films and rewatching it never gets old."

"The theatrical cut of this film is garbage which is why I rated it eight stars instead of nine. The first time I watched this film I didn't like it (not straight out hate but didn't like). Character motivations didn't make any sense, Lex was annoying as s***, editing was sloppy, and it was overly dark and broody for an action superhero movie. A year + a half, five Marvel films, a ton of bad reviews and a Justice League later a thought popped into my head: \"what if I watched BVS again\". This time I didn't have trailers ruining the best moments, I only vaguely remembered the film, and I was conditioned to look at it negatively but something unexpected happened: I actually loved it. Superman was just a normal person that tried to make a difference cause he could that others imposed their own beliefs on. Lex Luthor was a genius that couldn't stand his powerlessness compared to Superman or more accurately a super being. As Alfred said \"The fever, the rage, the feeling of powerlessness that turns good men... cruel\" and you see the same thought process in Batman. Batman, just like Lex Luthor feels powerless in the midst of a god-being and just like Lex he attempts to destroy him so he can get his sense of power back but unlike Lex, Batman learns something. I what is one of the corniest lines of the movie Superman says, \"Martha\" when he knows he can't win against Batman in a late desperate attempt to save his mother. Not only does this name connect with Bruce Wayne but it also shows what really matters to a man of steel: it isn't power, it isn't fame or anything else, it is his Mother and on a broader scale it is people. Lex (who doesn't care about people at all) knows he doesn't have the power so he creates something from his blood and the remains of Zod: A Doomsday for Superman. Not only does this film have depth but it also doesn't always explain it to you which is rare in a blockbuster action superhero flick normally cater to semi-comic book fans and people that want to shove popcorn in their mouths. This film rewards you for really noticing the details while still having massive explosions. One of my favorites is how Lex has all of Batman's branded killed which is why he isn't afraid of the branding at the end or Grandma's Peach Tea as a way of scaring the s*** out of someone. Of course, this film isn't perfect and I do have personal dislikes. The Batman V Superman fight was slow and pretty boring especially after watching such an amazing fight in Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 2 (If you haven't watched the animated Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 1 and 2 you are sorely missing out on something fantastic). Also, the addition of Wonder Woman who pretty much steals a hacker thing, gives it back and then suits up and fights against a giant monster thing. Not to say I don't like Wonder Woman (She is one of my favorite Superheroes of all time who showed not only can woman kick a** but they also don't need to be ashamed of their sexuality or gender) but she wasn't really that helpful to the plot and just brought in to expand the universe which was well done through Lex's superhuman hunting files. Also, the post-apocalyptic scene that was just a dream could have been cut but nothing is perfect except movies like Citizen Kane which isn't a lot of fun to watch cause it is too perfect. So to summarize, the theatrical cut is bad, the ultimate cut is Amazing and the other cut is meh. Please give it a second chance because it deserves it and save a good director from losing grace because of something he didn't do."
"I really liked it, don't know what all the hate is about. I'm actually a Marvel fan from when I was 7 or so, but Superman and Batman together in 1 movie? Just great. And personally I like Ben Affleck even better than Christian Bale as Batman. So just watch and enjoy, I know I did!"

"That's right. We have been waiting for these two heroes to finally meet and fight against each other. This movie is so good in both plot and special effects.Henry Cavill and Ben Affleck have performed well in their acting stages. They are the best superhero actors and they have filmed their fighting scenes very well. The movie starts to show the conflict between the lives of the heroes and now they have blamed each other for it. This movie is amazing and sets up a good plot for Dawn Justice."

"Actually...I didn't know what to expect. When you see Wonder Woman, you know it will be off of Wonder Woman and off of a Wonder Woman story, but with Batman V Superman, I was like, \"hmmmm, so who is this about?\" It was pretty obvious that it would feature many characters, but I thought the introduction to Batman was amazing. Ben Affleck nailed the part, not only as Batman but also as Bruce Wayne. He is my Batman. Henry Cavill continued to be super as the Man of Steel. And he is my Super - Man. A dark story? Yes, without a doubt. Could it have had a few more jokes? Sure. But not all movies or stories need to have jokes when certain events are serious. I really hope people can see this review and take another look at the movie, because, I loved it. I really hope the ratings can go up, eventually. And P.S, this movie is the perfect set up to Justice League."

"I'll start by making it clear I have only ever seen the Ultimate Edition. I'm aware of what was cut out for the theatrical release, so I will concede up front that most of the criticisms about pacing, editing, and missing bits of plot at release were merited.With that caveat out of the way, I must reiterate that this was bar-none the boldest superhero movie I have ever seen. To me, it was arguably the best as well, though \"best\" shouldn't be taken to mean \"most enjoyable.\" That honor easily goes to \"Thor: Ragnarok.\" What makes BvS stand out among other films in the genre is that it takes two characters who have been done to death since the 1970s and brings them up to date. I recently tried to watch \"Superman: The Movie\" for the first time in a number of years, and while it was still good and Reeves will always be iconic, I just couldn't take it seriously. I'll put it this way: If the story in BvS was \"stupid\" in your view but Superman turning back time by spinning the earth backward on its axis didn't seem like one of the dumbest things you have ever seen -in any movie from any genre- to the extent that it outright ruins the movie for you, then your opinion about BvS isn't worth much. Nostalgic bias was always going to be a problem for this movie, and the way people reacted to and reviewed \"Man of Steel\" was telling in this regard.That brings me to Zack Snyder's take on Superman. You know, that guy whose status as the first extraterrestrial ever encountered by humanity was a total non-issue in the old movies. Apparently, Snyder has a similar view to my own in that his take on the Man of Steel makes his being an alien a core piece of his identity. He may look like any other (absurdly attractive) person, but he knows what he is, and that makes him perpetually uncertain of where he fits in this world. He is essentially good and really does care about people, but he struggles to truly empathize with the likes of us. To be human is to be frail, and that is not something he can easily relate to. This is the root of his conflict with Batman.Just as Clark struggles to genuinely relate to most people, Snyder's Batman either refuses to or otherwise just can't relate to Superman. He doesn't see him as anything but a threat regardless of Superman's clear good intentions. Remember, a small group of Kryptonians were able to bring humanity to the brink of extinction in less than a day, and Bruce Wayne is nothing if not a realist. He didn't know the guy from Kansas. He only knew the god from another world.While Batman's anger toward and fear of Superman are readily apparent from the start, Superman's inability to imagine things from Bruce Wayne's perspective only becomes truly apparent during their first real interaction. This reminded me of the animated version of the \"world's finest\" storyline, where Superman judges Batman harshly for using fear tactics and threats of violence (also, actual violence) to get the job done. Superman wasn't willing to consider what it would take for a human man to fight criminals and save innocents, or what that life would do to him over time. Just as Batman didn't see the guy from Kansas, Superman didn't see the man who lives his life trapped in one brutal, unthinkably traumatic moment (this was beautifully conveyed during the film's opening moments), and had spent his whole adult life bearing witness to humanity at its absolute worst.The conflict between these two characters is as old as human history. They want the same things, but they can't understand one another. So they fight. And what a fight it was.Watching a fight between, say, Captain America and Iron Man was, to me, more frustrating than anything because each understood the other's perspective perfectly. The fight between Batman and Superman in BvS was genuinely gut-wrenching, as intended, because they would have understood one another if either had tried. The whole sequence hilighted Batman's tactical prowess and ability to control a situation. Maybe the most badass thing about the fight was that it ended exactly where Batman planned. That brings me to the big elephant in the room named \"Martha.\"I can't recall exactly which YouTuber put it this way, but if you thought the \"save Martha\" exchange was about their mothers having the same name, you had your brain turned off. The brain-on people have explained this to death, but it bears repeating. This was the moment when Superman became humanized to Batman. He was about to die, and his only concern was for his adoptive human mother. He still believed that the man about to take his life would do the right thing. Even with the cowl on, there was no mistaking the look on Batman's face. It was the look of shame, guilt, and sudden uncertainty that says \"What am I doing?\" Turns out even the most brutal, angry version of Bruce Wayne is better than Tony Stark at knowing right from wrong. At knowing that he had gone too far.From there, the third act was a series of truly impressive (albeit mostly CGI) fight sequences, beginning with what I regard as the undisputed champion of Batman fights. Nothing in the Nolan movies (and especially nothing in the Burton movies) even came close. Go ahead, try to convince yourself that Batman and Bane taking turns punching one another in the face until Bane's mask broke was a good fight sequence. No, this was a fight straight out of \"Arkham Knight,\" and it was glorious. The battle against Doomsday really was one for the books. From the moment Wonder Woman arrived accompanied by the intense sounds of Tina Guo's electric cello to Superman's tragic, heroic death at the hands of Doomsday, I was glued to the screen. Sure, the mere presence of Doomsday spoiled the end to a degree, but watching the Man of Steel laboring to carry that kryptonite spear towards certain death was no less impactful. A brief word on Jesse Eisenberg's take on Lex Luthor. At least one other reviewer on this site already said it best when they pointed out that this was his origin story. If you consider his scheme objectively, he is actually one of the more formidable incarnations of the character. If we're lucky, we'll eventually get to see a Snyder Cut of \"Justice League\" and find out where this story was actually meant to go. For the record, Joss Whedon and Danny Elfman both should have said \"no\" to taking a dump on someone else's art."
"BATMAN V SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE brings a fantastic surprise to a smash-hit team-up with one of the worlds most beloved DC Comics' icons of all time. The movie delivers spectacular casting, and fantastic acting with different characters having their shine in each scenes.The story follows Clark Kent/Superman who becomes a threat, after the destruction in Metropolis in Man Of Steel.(2013). Batman/Bruce Wayne sees him as a threat and begins his war on Superman.The movie brings spectacular storytelling, it tells the complications of human against alien who are on the same side, and the first meeting of Batman and Superman. The story of Bruce Wayne, with his many years of The Caped Crusader, sends him on a spiral of \"out of control\", sheer anger, and builds tension to wanting to defeat the Man of Steel. Snyder has fantastically gave this storytelling an exciting nod to the comics.Lex Luthor, played by Jesse Einsberg, delivers a very interesting performance, but very differently by him showing is his \"origin\" before he becomes a bald foe to the Man of Steel. He shows that his love of \"god vs man\" terrorises mankind when he ultimately creates Doomsday, and Batman realises Superman's inner heroism.It packs so many great \"out of nowhere\" excitement, including a first-look of the fearful Wonder Woman a.k.a. Diana Prince, played by Gal Gadot, and a fresh-new glimpse of the superhero DC canon: The Justice League.WATCH THIS MOVIE! The critics are out of their mind. It's a fun-packed action adventure which still keeps the movie enjoyable until it's final minutes of the movie. It's a FANTASTIC MOVIE! BEN AFFLECK AS BATMAN... is Incredible!A 10/10 overall!"
"I want to go on record as saying that this is a truly thrilling cinematic experience in so many ways. If pressed, I guess I could acknowledge that there were a couple ... let's say \"clumsy\" moments. And in a film that runs to three hours, that hardly seems like a significant issue, certainly not enough to rate it with fewer than 9 stars.This film has everything. There is dramatic tension right from the start. There is a magnificent story arc that picks up quite seamlessly from 'Man of Steel' and propels the viewer not only into the life of Clark Kent/Superman but also of Bruce Wayne/Batman.The villain is no mere cartoon of a villain; he is truly thoroughly (and apparently irrevocably) diabolical. He is a psychopath, and you wish for his death over and over and over. You want Superman to reduce him to ash with the power of his eyes.I have read a number of viewers' reviews, and it seems that the people who disliked the film / gave it a low rating had rather unfair and unrealistic expectations of it. That is, their own prejudices about how the plot could/should unfold or what the character development could/should be, etc. ruined the film for them. And that is a shame.My thought is: I settle into my seat, wait for the lights to dim, and then I wait to be transported by the film. I accept it, lock, stock, and barrel.As another reviewer remarked, I love how the film begins from the point of view of Bruce Wayne as he is among people on the ground who have fallen victim to the attack of Zod and the other Kryptonians.Why would Bruce Wayne not like Superman? Why would the good people of Earth hurl insults at Superman and burn him in effigy (on the news)? Because the good people of Earth just got catapulted into a new reality in which there are not only extraterrestrial beings (surprise!) but they are also superman! And a group of them are hell-bent on destroying humankind and taking the planet for themselves.It is difficult to see Superman as separate from the whole Kryptonian Krew.It seems that many moviegoers forgot that Bruce Wayne is also human. Sure, he's a hero, but he is flawed.. Just like the rest of us. He is a vigilante, after all.He has let his vigilantism get the better of him. HE is actually the one working outside the boundaries of the law, not Superman. It is the clear head of Alfred that shows us that he has gone into a rather dark place, that he has not seen what is really going on (in Luthor's scheme), and so he chooses to embark on his own scheme scheme to take out the alien invader. He is (allegedly) thinking of the future: if he wipes out the all-powerful alien, then it can't turn on humankind in the future. At least, he convinces himself of that.A philosophical question is raised in the film: should Clark Kent have remained a simple man from Kansas and never have become the Superman? Should he just let people die and let calamities happen? The question is answered for us in the character of Diana Prince/Wonder Woman. She withdrew from mankind (her exact words) and just sat around watching. Watching while people died horrible deaths all around her. So, should Superman have done the same? Do these special beings, these 'metahumans', have some kind of moral imperative to intervene, or should they be allowed to be regular people, too? It seems that humans want it both ways.It seems that humans are saying: \"Don't be a superalien ... except when I and my friends and family are in trouble. Then come save us.\""

"Batman v Superman: Ultimate Edition: If your looking for a quick, cheap thrill then you might not enjoy this film at the time. This movies theatrical version was butchered by WB and in doing so reshaped the story leaving numerous plot holes. So the Ultimate Edition is the full story and the one worth seeing. Watch 'Man of Steel' before seeing this movie. There is much to claw through here, so much so that the audience might easily find themselves exhausted from the overall aggression of the film. However, a lot of the story does work. The action is good, and the emotion feels real most of the time.This film is about Superman trying to become Superman. Trying to help the world, save people, find a place in this world not as an outcast, and yet is looked at has a threat by many. Superman is not from this world, yet He is trying to be human, find a place in this world, be excepted by earths people, and come into his destiny.This film is also about Batman being Batman for 20 years and losing faith in humanity, and fearing Superman, what Superman can do with his powers. Great film, great plot, great visuals. ---Yidioo"
"I didn't see the film in the theaters and just bought the \"Extended Edition \" on Amazon. I never properly saw Man of Steel- i think I rented it and watched it when already exhausted and fell asleep. I saw the mediocre user reviews and horrible reviews from critics of this film.They really have it wrong. This is the very best either Batman or Superman. It has a different take, on things. Much darker then earlier films even darker then the Christopher Nolan Batman films.First of all Christopher Nolan is an Executive Producer. So how bad could it be? I loved Sucker Punch and Zack Snyder was involved with that. So how bad could this be? Hans Zimmer did the music, so how bad could it be?I remember watching the old Superman TV shows and reading the Superman and Batman comics as a little kid and loved them, but i wouldn't call myself a \"fan boy\" of comic universes, like so many younger people today. As an older adult I will admit my favorite TV show of all time was Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but watched it on DVD only after it had finished. I saw the second of the Dark Knight series in the theater, but the other two, I watched on DVD. They were great, but not my favorite films like so many people. i also loved the first couple Superman and Batman films in the older series. Regardless, i was not waiting with baited breath to see Man of Steel or this one.I'm more of a serious film fan, who can watch Stanley Kubrick films over and over and my favorite films in the last twenty years, are Eyes Wide Shut and Intersteller, both of which i've watched multiple times.So, with that said, take it from me, the critics have this film very wrong, just as critics hated 2001: A Space Odyssey when it first came out. This film will have lasting appreciation.Surprised how much I liked Ben Afleck's Batman. it was hard to get into Henry Cavil's scrawnier looking Superman, but it grew on me. Amy Adams was great as Lois Lane, The Gal Gadol Wonder Women was amazing. Lex Luther was terrific, like Nolan's Joker. Jeremy Irons was the best Alfred ever. Holly Hunter and Diane Lane was good too. The movie had bad reviews but made a billion dollars. Hopefully everyone buys the Ultimate Edition and it breaks sales records and the film is re-appreciated. I have no idea what scenes this Ultimate Edition added, but it is pretty perfect. Now I can't wait for Wonder Woman and the Justice League and as soon as I finish writing this am going to watch Man of Steal. I'm into it now!I can only surmise that the bad reviews stem from too much expectations of the rigid fan boy types and the radical changes in tone, we see in this film.Total masterpiece of cinema, but I have a few criticisms. There are a few hollow scenes of typical Idiot cops and authorities getting everything wrong in a cliché type way and it has a few filler scenes of that type and a few moments here and there that felt rushed and cheesy. Maybe not everything restored into the Ultimate Edition should have been. I wish there had been more Kevin Costner scenes."

"The whole entire Batman V Superman movie was great and yes even though it felt slow to the majority of the people who watched it but to me I enjoyed every part and every scene of Batman V Superman and when it got to the fight scenes both batman VS Superman and the Doomsday fight it brought so much drama, intensity, and epic performances. So with that being said I give this movie a good 10/10 because it really did go to my expectations and it brought a powerful performance and a powerful yet epic introduction to the upcoming Justice League."

"When I first wrote a review for this movie a year ago exclaiming my excitement for the film, I had been high off a fresh dose of live-action DC superheroes playing out the beloved comic book stories that I had grown up on. It was all playing out before my eyes and coming to life. After a few months had passed, I began to notice things about the movie that I disliked: little gaps in the story, things that didn't add up, etc. My original rating of a 10 / 10 dropped to an 8 /10. But today it has gone back up to a 10. The extended version of the film not only rectifies the gaps but also silences critics.Many claimed that the movie was too dark or that it just didn't make sense. To those people, I say: \"Pick up a comic book!\" Many of the critics of this particular film were part of the superhero bandwagon that formed when Marvel began its spree of Avengers-related films. In fact, its estimated that over 60% of people who go to see 'superhero' genre films have never picked up a comic book in their life. I would argue that similar numbers could figure to those which view the CW televised DC Universe shows. People complain that DC comics is just too dark but the fact is that these movies are based upon actual comics which are meant to be dark (ex: The Dark Knight Returns, Injustice, etc.). Its like complaining that Game of Thrones (the TV series) sucks because they kill off too many characters. Read the books! Its frustrating to see such a beautiful work of art like Batman V Superman criticized by those ignorant to its universe and its meaning. This movie is in fact a catalyst that opens numerous doorways and leaves true fans in awe of the possibilities for future movies. But regardless of whether or not people choose to educate themselves, this film's DVD/Blu-ray extended version puts the theater release to shame. All of the plot holes and gaps are filled in 30 minutes of extended footage scattered throughout the film. The movie ultimately becomes more complete and people will wish that the movie had shown the full 3 hours of footage in its theatrical debut. As a major DC comics fan, I will of course pick up on things that a comics fan would not, but someone who does not read comics would learn to appreciate this film in its entirety with the extended version. Get your hands on a copy today or find it on Netflix or the internet somewhere!"

"I ignored the bad reviews and watched anyways. This film had a lot to live up to after Civil War was released and I went into this film expecting the worst. It ended up to be the best Superhero film of 2016 to me. One complaint was that this film was more concerned about universe building than telling a great story than Civil War but for me it was the other way around; Civil War felt like a build up to something else and to be honest, I felt that way when I saw the other MCU films. Batman vs Superman however not only had a great story, but it also felt a lot more consistent than Civil War. This film was way more diverse with the cast than the MCU but unlike the MCU, I felt like this film doesn't go overboard with the SJW stuff like the MCU films or The Star Wars Sequel films do. The Visuals were AMAZING, The Score by Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL was AMAZING as well, The Tone is just right as I actually felt for the characters emotionally, The Cinematography kept my eyes glued to the screen, and the script felt really Intelligent and Complex and despite people calling the writing confusing, I was able to piece it together with no problem whatsoever. This film is similar to Empire Strikes back in terms of popularity so over time after the other movies are released, this movie would probably be more popular.This film was way better than I Expected and deserves another chance.

"Its shame to see what critics and marvel fans did to this movie and targeted Zack Snyder for it. I have seen this movie more than 25 times till date. And i enjoy this movie as much as i enjoyed the first time. The fans who have read DC comics, wouldn't be disappointed in this movie. Its dark movie, yes it is. Because the title shows the intense situation at hand. Two superheroes about to rip each other apart for whatever reasons that brought them to this stage. Yes it had to be dark and intense.Only marvel can be stupid enough to show an alien invasion where humans are loosing the battle and the super heroes are cracking jokes while battles as if they are playing ping pong. a person playing Call of Duty game is more serious while playing than the marvel heroes fighting aliens."

"Last week some news came out from somebody online who had claimed to have seen a finished version of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. If you were like me, you've been leery of checking it out because you weren't sure how much might actually be true. Now Zack Snyder has spoken out about the spoiler-filled post, although his response doesn't really clear anything up.In a word, to MTV, he called the post \"hilarious,which might imply that he's saying that it's mostly, if not entirely, untrue. That might be the case, but then again he could have just said it was untrue and he didn't say that. What he did say, however, is that he doesn't like spoilers. While this may seem odd for the director who's most recent trailer appeared to give away the entire movie, Snyder says that's not the case. Even if you've seen the trailer, you can rest easy, as there is much more we have not seen in then finished film. Says Snyder I have the benefit of seeing the movie. It's cool that think it's too much, and I appreciate people not wanting to know, but there's plenty that they don't know. There's a lot of movie that's not in the trailer. In the process of calling the Batman v Superman Reddit review hilarious, Snyder goes on to talk about how he hates it when spoilers come out. The director would much rather that fans see the movie mostly blind. While he understands that some fans may wish to find the answers before hand, he wants his movies to be mysteries going in. If you're, as an audience member, exploring these articles, looking for answers to questions that you have, maybe you're okay with knowing before you go. It's like an individual taste. But like I said, I want people to see the movie without knowing.Spoilers are a topic that mean different things to different people. While most try to avoid them to some degree, the need to solve the mystery is a nearly universal human experience. We have an inclination to want to know the truth, even while also wanting to be surprised. For most of us getting some information is good, but getting all the information is bad, of course, only getting the details that you want can be difficult."
"The theatrical is choppy, poorly edited, hard to follow, with some really good moments mixed in their. The extended is much more fluent and is much easier to follow, it does have a long runtime, which might make it seem a bit dragging on, but if you like long films done right, like Lord of the Rings, you will like this movie as long as you get into the characters and story. Speaking of which, the story starts out perfectly showing Bruce Wayne as a character, and it is very powerful. There are several moments in this movie that are powerful, emotional, and shocking. Characters. Batman is my favorite fictional character of all time, and believe me when I say, Ben Affleck as Batman was perfect, he had the charisma, the anger, and the look of being through some bad stuff Gal Gadot also does perfect as Wonder Woman, but if you want to really see how good she does, go watch the Wonder Woman movie. Henry Call as Superman. I really don't like it when people say Christopher Reeves is better. Don't get me wrong, Reeves does great, but can you imagine him as Superman in this movie? I wouldn't like it. It would be like Adam West playing Batman in The Dark Knight. Henry Cavill does great in this role, I can say everything about him as I said with Ben Affleck. Jesse Eisenberg as Luthor. I thought it was different in a good way. I've heard a criticism for him as being too much like Joker, but is that a bad thing? Joker is my favorite villain, so to see Superman have an enemy that crazy, but still hold the values Luthor needs to be Luthor, I think it is great. The thing I thought this movie was lacking in the first and second acts was humor, at least good humor. If there was more humor, I would've given this movie a ten because it would give a more relaxing feel to the parts that needed it. All in all though, this movie was awesome, it had powerful moments, it was badass, and just plain fun. It had a great story arc and does its job very well."

"*I will be talking about the Ultimate Edition of the film* This was one of the most anticipated CBM of all time. Ever since the arrival and subsequent success of Marvel's The Avengers people have wondered when will DC launch its own cinematic universe, one of the main reasons being the opportunity to finally see titans such as Batman and Superman share the screen together: the ultimate nerd dream. On 2016, the moment finally came for BvS to be released AND.. it performed poorly. Not only did critical reception left a lot to be desired, but fan reactions where surprisingly split after its cinematic debut. People either loved it and called Zack a genius, or hated it and called him a hack. Me, personally, I found myself with middle of the road feelings, for sure, but more leaning towards the negative side with subsequent viewings. The theatrical cut of the film showcased amazing performances, incredible visuals, and action set pieces that seemed like comic book panels come to life, in a good way. However, when it comes to its narrative structure and more technical aspects like editing, the film was seriously flawed. More plot holes than Age of Ultron, questionable character decisions, random editing that lacked cohesion and focus, and forced dramatic moments that lacked any impact because the attempts at character development ranged from limited to nonexistent, especially when it comes to Superman's character. I thought it was a 5/10 movie at best. As such, I was kind of skeptical about the idea of a 30 minute longer version. I say kind of because I know how Zack works. I remember Watchmen being vastly improved with its director's cut, so in a way I was expecting BvS to perform in a similar manner, but I also feared those 30 minutes wold be just there to amplify action and discredit storytelling issues. Oh boy, I'm so glad I was proved wrong. The ultimate cut of the film was infuriating, but not because it was awful, but because it questions the sanity of WB executives and editors and makes you wonder what were they thinking during the editing process. What I got out of the Ultimate Edition was a thought-provoking deconstruction of two very iconic superheroes that gave spotlight to the struggles both of them face when they aren't fighting crime. What I got was an extremely well produced character study on both Batman and Superman in a cynical world, a world dangerously close to our own. We meet Batman as a ruthless, worn out hero that has seen the failure behind his ideals and witnessed some truly horrifying things in his life. Superman, on the other hand, is portrayed as a godlike figure that seeks to do good in the world, but finds himself emotionally conflicted once he realized that every good deed he does leaves behind a trail of destruction (most of it due to Luthor's antics). In my opinion, this is a hugely original approach, one that distances itself from the rest of the competition and delivers a dark, somber, yet relevant superhero movie that understands both characters and gives them real human struggles to deal with. I felt invested in both of them, and hoped that by the end of the film both could find a way to redeem themselves. Their character arcs were very well established during the first two acts of the movie, and by the time we get to the titular climactic battle the emotion behind the jaw-dropping action is intensified. Lex Luthor as a villain was also given more time to develop with this new edition. One of the main criticisms with the original version was the fact that his plan relied too much on conveniences, and the character's mannerisms and mad-scientist attitude was annoying, and that goes without saying his motivations were unclear. Not only do we spend more time understanding his hate for any godlike figure and thus his hatred for Superman, but the added scenes allowed us to witness his entire plan come to fruition. It sells the cold, manipulative, calculating attributes of his comic counterpart. The acting is spot on. Every actor owns his/her role, from Cavill's Superman, to Ben Affleck as Batman, Eisenberg as Luthor, and Gadot as Wonder Woman, whose scenes are brief, but are more than enough to sell the strong and ferocious warrior that she is. Cinematography is stunning, and miles above that of Man of Steel's. And the soundtrack by Zimmer and Junkie XL? Perfect, just perfect. When it comes to flaws, the film still has some of those. The Martha moment, while serving as a pivotal character moment for Batman, felt off in execution, and its understandable that many people got mad at it. If your main complaint about BvS the first time around was its bleak tone and subject matter, this film is still not for you. I understand most were expecting to see the heroes being the most iconic versions of themselves, clashing in an elongated battle and evoking the same feelings The Avengers gave audiences back in 2012. In that sense, the film will remain divisive, but at least I have the comfort of saying that, at the very least, the film is competently made."

"This film was amazing. Ben Affleck was easily the best part of this movie, he brought his a-game as Batman. The chemistry between Affleck & Irons was outstanding. Gal Gadot did a great job as Wonder Woman. The fight between Batman & Superman was awesome. The final fight with Doomsday was outstanding in every way possible. However, there is only one problem with this film and that's Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor. He was sadly missed cast in this role, but then again it's really the fault of Warner Bros. Studios. Overall, this film deliver on almost every level. I highly recommend that you watch the extended version of this film."

"I know I know. I saw it in theaters too, and felt like it could've been so much better. While the Batman element was good, the narrative felt fractured, and the third act was just one long stunt scene. Superman was relegated to a supporting character, and other characters didn't get a chance to shine. And then I chanced on the ultimate cut. Calling it 30 mins of \"extra\" footage is unfair to Zack Snyder because it's exactly these 30 mins that makes the movie a worthy one. What I can say about the theatrical cut is this - It had the blockbuster elements - music, visuals, stunts, CGI. But, it lacked the human elements. The first 20 mins of the movie had it, but not after that. The extended cut in comparison has a flow to the narrative. There are no disjointed scenes, everything flows smoothly, and there's connective tissue. Superman gets to spend some time with his father, and mother. Clark Kent does some investigative journalism. Superman helps the people after the blast. Lois Lane doesn't jump to conclusions, she gets to the bottom of the crime. Lex Luthor apparently had a coherent plan - everything is explained pretty well. Wonder Woman was already good, so there's no change there :) Also, the \"Martha\" scene seems better executed, because it is a few seconds longer, and there's time to breathe it in. So, here's my take on this movie - The theatrical cut was junk. Get the Bluray for ultimate edition, and you shall not be disappointed. I've seen it so many more times now, and it's the definitive cut. It is the movie we deserve. It's a unique take on Batman, and Superman. It's a gritty take on the superhero movie genre, and definitely the best DCEU movie, and the best DC movie since The Dark Knight.P.S. Yes it's dark. We're adults, and we should appreciate mature film making without intentionally silly moments. It attempts to be philosophical, and something deep instead of just trying to make you chuckle."

"This is one of the best superhero movies ever made. Zack Snyder is a magician behind the camera.The reason behind so many complaints is the fact that Warner Bros. marketed this movie as a fight between Batman and Superman. That's not what it is. It's a movie about the origins of the Justice League.The cinematography, the acting and the score are all second to none. This film is phenomenal.P.S: watch the 3 hour extended cut that Snyder intended you to see, not the 2 and a half hour movie that Warner Bros. decided would be better for theaters."

"I don't care what the critics say, this is a very well-done movie. I'll start my review by listing what I like about the movie.1.) Ben Affleck is the best batman to me and it is not close. He pulls off the role of an aging batman extremely well. Also, Zack Snyder's vision of batman is legit. I have always hated batman up until this adaptation of him. Instead of being a conflicted and idealistic batman, this batman is dark, gritty, and 100% a badass. His equipment is decked out with machine guns and he has no aversion to killing people. In fact, he probably kills about 50 criminal by the time this movie is over. The warehouse scene is the coolest batman scene in any movie.2.) The development of a grudge between batman and superman is pulled off flawlessly. It actually makes sense why batman dislikes superman. Then, when they do fight it is about the coolest thing you can expect to see from a superhero film. 3.) I disagree with a lot of people about Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor. In my opinion, he played his role to perfection. 4.) B v S sets up Wonder Woman and Justice League with Gal Gadot's cameo as Wonder Woman and short clips of Aquaman, the Flash, and Cyborg. B v S is one of my favorite superhero films and rewatching it never gets old."

"The theatrical cut of this film is garbage which is why I rated it eight stars instead of nine. The first time I watched this film I didn't like it (not straight out hate but didn't like). Character motivations didn't make any sense, Lex was annoying as s***, editing was sloppy, and it was overly dark and broody for an action superhero movie. A year + a half, five Marvel films, a ton of bad reviews and a Justice League later a thought popped into my head: \"what if I watched BVS again\". This time I didn't have trailers ruining the best moments, I only vaguely remembered the film, and I was conditioned to look at it negatively but something unexpected happened: I actually loved it. Superman was just a normal person that tried to make a difference cause he could that others imposed their own beliefs on. Lex Luthor was a genius that couldn't stand his powerlessness compared to Superman or more accurately a super being. As Alfred said \"The fever, the rage, the feeling of powerlessness that turns good men... cruel\" and you see the same thought process in Batman. Batman, just like Lex Luthor feels powerless in the midst of a god-being and just like Lex he attempts to destroy him so he can get his sense of power back but unlike Lex, Batman learns something. I what is one of the corniest lines of the movie Superman says, \"Martha\" when he knows he can't win against Batman in a late desperate attempt to save his mother. Not only does this name connect with Bruce Wayne but it also shows what really matters to a man of steel: it isn't power, it isn't fame or anything else, it is his Mother and on a broader scale it is people. Lex (who doesn't care about people at all) knows he doesn't have the power so he creates something from his blood and the remains of Zod: A Doomsday for Superman. Not only does this film have depth but it also doesn't always explain it to you which is rare in a blockbuster action superhero flick normally cater to semi-comic book fans and people that want to shove popcorn in their mouths. This film rewards you for really noticing the details while still having massive explosions. One of my favorites is how Lex has all of Batman's branded killed which is why he isn't afraid of the branding at the end or Grandma's Peach Tea as a way of scaring the s*** out of someone. Of course, this film isn't perfect and I do have personal dislikes. The Batman V Superman fight was slow and pretty boring especially after watching such an amazing fight in Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 2 (If you haven't watched the animated Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 1 and 2 you are sorely missing out on something fantastic). Also, the addition of Wonder Woman who pretty much steals a hacker thing, gives it back and then suits up and fights against a giant monster thing. Not to say I don't like Wonder Woman (She is one of my favorite Superheroes of all time who showed not only can woman kick a** but they also don't need to be ashamed of their sexuality or gender) but she wasn't really that helpful to the plot and just brought in to expand the universe which was well done through Lex's superhuman hunting files. Also, the post-apocalyptic scene that was just a dream could have been cut but nothing is perfect except movies like Citizen Kane which isn't a lot of fun to watch cause it is too perfect. So to summarize, the theatrical cut is bad, the ultimate cut is Amazing and the other cut is meh. Please give it a second chance because it deserves it and save a good director from losing grace because of something he didn't do."
"I really liked it, don't know what all the hate is about. I'm actually a Marvel fan from when I was 7 or so, but Superman and Batman together in 1 movie? Just great. And personally I like Ben Affleck even better than Christian Bale as Batman. So just watch and enjoy, I know I did!"

"That's right. We have been waiting for these two heroes to finally meet and fight against each other. This movie is so good in both plot and special effects.Henry Cavill and Ben Affleck have performed well in their acting stages. They are the best superhero actors and they have filmed their fighting scenes very well. The movie starts to show the conflict between the lives of the heroes and now they have blamed each other for it. This movie is amazing and sets up a good plot for Dawn Justice."

"Actually...I didn't know what to expect. When you see Wonder Woman, you know it will be off of Wonder Woman and off of a Wonder Woman story, but with Batman V Superman, I was like, \"hmmmm, so who is this about?\" It was pretty obvious that it would feature many characters, but I thought the introduction to Batman was amazing. Ben Affleck nailed the part, not only as Batman but also as Bruce Wayne. He is my Batman. Henry Cavill continued to be super as the Man of Steel. And he is my Super - Man. A dark story? Yes, without a doubt. Could it have had a few more jokes? Sure. But not all movies or stories need to have jokes when certain events are serious. I really hope people can see this review and take another look at the movie, because, I loved it. I really hope the ratings can go up, eventually. And P.S, this movie is the perfect set up to Justice League."

"I'll start by making it clear I have only ever seen the Ultimate Edition. I'm aware of what was cut out for the theatrical release, so I will concede up front that most of the criticisms about pacing, editing, and missing bits of plot at release were merited.With that caveat out of the way, I must reiterate that this was bar-none the boldest superhero movie I have ever seen. To me, it was arguably the best as well, though \"best\" shouldn't be taken to mean \"most enjoyable.\" That honor easily goes to \"Thor: Ragnarok.\" What makes BvS stand out among other films in the genre is that it takes two characters who have been done to death since the 1970s and brings them up to date. I recently tried to watch \"Superman: The Movie\" for the first time in a number of years, and while it was still good and Reeves will always be iconic, I just couldn't take it seriously. I'll put it this way: If the story in BvS was \"stupid\" in your view but Superman turning back time by spinning the earth backward on its axis didn't seem like one of the dumbest things you have ever seen -in any movie from any genre- to the extent that it outright ruins the movie for you, then your opinion about BvS isn't worth much. Nostalgic bias was always going to be a problem for this movie, and the way people reacted to and reviewed \"Man of Steel\" was telling in this regard.That brings me to Zack Snyder's take on Superman. You know, that guy whose status as the first extraterrestrial ever encountered by humanity was a total non-issue in the old movies. Apparently, Snyder has a similar view to my own in that his take on the Man of Steel makes his being an alien a core piece of his identity. He may look like any other (absurdly attractive) person, but he knows what he is, and that makes him perpetually uncertain of where he fits in this world. He is essentially good and really does care about people, but he struggles to truly empathize with the likes of us. To be human is to be frail, and that is not something he can easily relate to. This is the root of his conflict with Batman.Just as Clark struggles to genuinely relate to most people, Snyder's Batman either refuses to or otherwise just can't relate to Superman. He doesn't see him as anything but a threat regardless of Superman's clear good intentions. Remember, a small group of Kryptonians were able to bring humanity to the brink of extinction in less than a day, and Bruce Wayne is nothing if not a realist. He didn't know the guy from Kansas. He only knew the god from another world.While Batman's anger toward and fear of Superman are readily apparent from the start, Superman's inability to imagine things from Bruce Wayne's perspective only becomes truly apparent during their first real interaction. This reminded me of the animated version of the \"world's finest\" storyline, where Superman judges Batman harshly for using fear tactics and threats of violence (also, actual violence) to get the job done. Superman wasn't willing to consider what it would take for a human man to fight criminals and save innocents, or what that life would do to him over time. Just as Batman didn't see the guy from Kansas, Superman didn't see the man who lives his life trapped in one brutal, unthinkably traumatic moment (this was beautifully conveyed during the film's opening moments), and had spent his whole adult life bearing witness to humanity at its absolute worst.The conflict between these two characters is as old as human history. They want the same things, but they can't understand one another. So they fight. And what a fight it was.Watching a fight between, say, Captain America and Iron Man was, to me, more frustrating than anything because each understood the other's perspective perfectly. The fight between Batman and Superman in BvS was genuinely gut-wrenching, as intended, because they would have understood one another if either had tried. The whole sequence hilighted Batman's tactical prowess and ability to control a situation. Maybe the most badass thing about the fight was that it ended exactly where Batman planned. That brings me to the big elephant in the room named \"Martha.\"I can't recall exactly which YouTuber put it this way, but if you thought the \"save Martha\" exchange was about their mothers having the same name, you had your brain turned off. The brain-on people have explained this to death, but it bears repeating. This was the moment when Superman became humanized to Batman. He was about to die, and his only concern was for his adoptive human mother. He still believed that the man about to take his life would do the right thing. Even with the cowl on, there was no mistaking the look on Batman's face. It was the look of shame, guilt, and sudden uncertainty that says \"What am I doing?\" Turns out even the most brutal, angry version of Bruce Wayne is better than Tony Stark at knowing right from wrong. At knowing that he had gone too far.From there, the third act was a series of truly impressive (albeit mostly CGI) fight sequences, beginning with what I regard as the undisputed champion of Batman fights. Nothing in the Nolan movies (and especially nothing in the Burton movies) even came close. Go ahead, try to convince yourself that Batman and Bane taking turns punching one another in the face until Bane's mask broke was a good fight sequence. No, this was a fight straight out of \"Arkham Knight,\" and it was glorious. The battle against Doomsday really was one for the books. From the moment Wonder Woman arrived accompanied by the intense sounds of Tina Guo's electric cello to Superman's tragic, heroic death at the hands of Doomsday, I was glued to the screen. Sure, the mere presence of Doomsday spoiled the end to a degree, but watching the Man of Steel laboring to carry that kryptonite spear towards certain death was no less impactful. A brief word on Jesse Eisenberg's take on Lex Luthor. At least one other reviewer on this site already said it best when they pointed out that this was his origin story. If you consider his scheme objectively, he is actually one of the more formidable incarnations of the character. If we're lucky, we'll eventually get to see a Snyder Cut of \"Justice League\" and find out where this story was actually meant to go. For the record, Joss Whedon and Danny Elfman both should have said \"no\" to taking a dump on someone else's art."
"BATMAN V SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE brings a fantastic surprise to a smash-hit team-up with one of the worlds most beloved DC Comics' icons of all time. The movie delivers spectacular casting, and fantastic acting with different characters having their shine in each scenes.The story follows Clark Kent/Superman who becomes a threat, after the destruction in Metropolis in Man Of Steel.(2013). Batman/Bruce Wayne sees him as a threat and begins his war on Superman.The movie brings spectacular storytelling, it tells the complications of human against alien who are on the same side, and the first meeting of Batman and Superman. The story of Bruce Wayne, with his many years of The Caped Crusader, sends him on a spiral of \"out of control\", sheer anger, and builds tension to wanting to defeat the Man of Steel. Snyder has fantastically gave this storytelling an exciting nod to the comics.Lex Luthor, played by Jesse Einsberg, delivers a very interesting performance, but very differently by him showing is his \"origin\" before he becomes a bald foe to the Man of Steel. He shows that his love of \"god vs man\" terrorises mankind when he ultimately creates Doomsday, and Batman realises Superman's inner heroism.It packs so many great \"out of nowhere\" excitement, including a first-look of the fearful Wonder Woman a.k.a. Diana Prince, played by Gal Gadot, and a fresh-new glimpse of the superhero DC canon: The Justice League.WATCH THIS MOVIE! The critics are out of their mind. It's a fun-packed action adventure which still keeps the movie enjoyable until it's final minutes of the movie. It's a FANTASTIC MOVIE! BEN AFFLECK AS BATMAN... is Incredible!A 10/10 overall!"
"I want to go on record as saying that this is a truly thrilling cinematic experience in so many ways. If pressed, I guess I could acknowledge that there were a couple ... let's say \"clumsy\" moments. And in a film that runs to three hours, that hardly seems like a significant issue, certainly not enough to rate it with fewer than 9 stars.This film has everything. There is dramatic tension right from the start. There is a magnificent story arc that picks up quite seamlessly from 'Man of Steel' and propels the viewer not only into the life of Clark Kent/Superman but also of Bruce Wayne/Batman.The villain is no mere cartoon of a villain; he is truly thoroughly (and apparently irrevocably) diabolical. He is a psychopath, and you wish for his death over and over and over. You want Superman to reduce him to ash with the power of his eyes.I have read a number of viewers' reviews, and it seems that the people who disliked the film / gave it a low rating had rather unfair and unrealistic expectations of it. That is, their own prejudices about how the plot could/should unfold or what the character development could/should be, etc. ruined the film for them. And that is a shame.My thought is: I settle into my seat, wait for the lights to dim, and then I wait to be transported by the film. I accept it, lock, stock, and barrel.As another reviewer remarked, I love how the film begins from the point of view of Bruce Wayne as he is among people on the ground who have fallen victim to the attack of Zod and the other Kryptonians.Why would Bruce Wayne not like Superman? Why would the good people of Earth hurl insults at Superman and burn him in effigy (on the news)? Because the good people of Earth just got catapulted into a new reality in which there are not only extraterrestrial beings (surprise!) but they are also superman! And a group of them are hell-bent on destroying humankind and taking the planet for themselves.It is difficult to see Superman as separate from the whole Kryptonian Krew.It seems that many moviegoers forgot that Bruce Wayne is also human. Sure, he's a hero, but he is flawed.. Just like the rest of us. He is a vigilante, after all.He has let his vigilantism get the better of him. HE is actually the one working outside the boundaries of the law, not Superman. It is the clear head of Alfred that shows us that he has gone into a rather dark place, that he has not seen what is really going on (in Luthor's scheme), and so he chooses to embark on his own scheme scheme to take out the alien invader. He is (allegedly) thinking of the future: if he wipes out the all-powerful alien, then it can't turn on humankind in the future. At least, he convinces himself of that.A philosophical question is raised in the film: should Clark Kent have remained a simple man from Kansas and never have become the Superman? Should he just let people die and let calamities happen? The question is answered for us in the character of Diana Prince/Wonder Woman. She withdrew from mankind (her exact words) and just sat around watching. Watching while people died horrible deaths all around her. So, should Superman have done the same? Do these special beings, these 'metahumans', have some kind of moral imperative to intervene, or should they be allowed to be regular people, too? It seems that humans want it both ways.It seems that humans are saying: \"Don't be a superalien ... except when I and my friends and family are in trouble. Then come save us.\""

"Batman v Superman: Ultimate Edition: If your looking for a quick, cheap thrill then you might not enjoy this film at the time. This movies theatrical version was butchered by WB and in doing so reshaped the story leaving numerous plot holes. So the Ultimate Edition is the full story and the one worth seeing. Watch 'Man of Steel' before seeing this movie. There is much to claw through here, so much so that the audience might easily find themselves exhausted from the overall aggression of the film. However, a lot of the story does work. The action is good, and the emotion feels real most of the time.This film is about Superman trying to become Superman. Trying to help the world, save people, find a place in this world not as an outcast, and yet is looked at has a threat by many. Superman is not from this world, yet He is trying to be human, find a place in this world, be excepted by earths people, and come into his destiny.This film is also about Batman being Batman for 20 years and losing faith in humanity, and fearing Superman, what Superman can do with his powers. Great film, great plot, great visuals. ---Yidioo"
"I didn't see the film in the theaters and just bought the \"Extended Edition \" on Amazon. I never properly saw Man of Steel- i think I rented it and watched it when already exhausted and fell asleep. I saw the mediocre user reviews and horrible reviews from critics of this film.They really have it wrong. This is the very best either Batman or Superman. It has a different take, on things. Much darker then earlier films even darker then the Christopher Nolan Batman films.First of all Christopher Nolan is an Executive Producer. So how bad could it be? I loved Sucker Punch and Zack Snyder was involved with that. So how bad could this be? Hans Zimmer did the music, so how bad could it be?I remember watching the old Superman TV shows and reading the Superman and Batman comics as a little kid and loved them, but i wouldn't call myself a \"fan boy\" of comic universes, like so many younger people today. As an older adult I will admit my favorite TV show of all time was Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but watched it on DVD only after it had finished. I saw the second of the Dark Knight series in the theater, but the other two, I watched on DVD. They were great, but not my favorite films like so many people. i also loved the first couple Superman and Batman films in the older series. Regardless, i was not waiting with baited breath to see Man of Steel or this one.I'm more of a serious film fan, who can watch Stanley Kubrick films over and over and my favorite films in the last twenty years, are Eyes Wide Shut and Intersteller, both of which i've watched multiple times.So, with that said, take it from me, the critics have this film very wrong, just as critics hated 2001: A Space Odyssey when it first came out. This film will have lasting appreciation.Surprised how much I liked Ben Afleck's Batman. it was hard to get into Henry Cavil's scrawnier looking Superman, but it grew on me. Amy Adams was great as Lois Lane, The Gal Gadol Wonder Women was amazing. Lex Luther was terrific, like Nolan's Joker. Jeremy Irons was the best Alfred ever. Holly Hunter and Diane Lane was good too. The movie had bad reviews but made a billion dollars. Hopefully everyone buys the Ultimate Edition and it breaks sales records and the film is re-appreciated. I have no idea what scenes this Ultimate Edition added, but it is pretty perfect. Now I can't wait for Wonder Woman and the Justice League and as soon as I finish writing this am going to watch Man of Steal. I'm into it now!I can only surmise that the bad reviews stem from too much expectations of the rigid fan boy types and the radical changes in tone, we see in this film.Total masterpiece of cinema, but I have a few criticisms. There are a few hollow scenes of typical Idiot cops and authorities getting everything wrong in a cliché type way and it has a few filler scenes of that type and a few moments here and there that felt rushed and cheesy. Maybe not everything restored into the Ultimate Edition should have been. I wish there had been more Kevin Costner scenes."

"The whole entire Batman V Superman movie was great and yes even though it felt slow to the majority of the people who watched it but to me I enjoyed every part and every scene of Batman V Superman and when it got to the fight scenes both batman VS Superman and the Doomsday fight it brought so much drama, intensity, and epic performances. So with that being said I give this movie a good 10/10 because it really did go to my expectations and it brought a powerful performance and a powerful yet epic introduction to the upcoming Justice League."

"When I first wrote a review for this movie a year ago exclaiming my excitement for the film, I had been high off a fresh dose of live-action DC superheroes playing out the beloved comic book stories that I had grown up on. It was all playing out before my eyes and coming to life. After a few months had passed, I began to notice things about the movie that I disliked: little gaps in the story, things that didn't add up, etc. My original rating of a 10 / 10 dropped to an 8 /10. But today it has gone back up to a 10. The extended version of the film not only rectifies the gaps but also silences critics.Many claimed that the movie was too dark or that it just didn't make sense. To those people, I say: \"Pick up a comic book!\" Many of the critics of this particular film were part of the superhero bandwagon that formed when Marvel began its spree of Avengers-related films. In fact, its estimated that over 60% of people who go to see 'superhero' genre films have never picked up a comic book in their life. I would argue that similar numbers could figure to those which view the CW televised DC Universe shows. People complain that DC comics is just too dark but the fact is that these movies are based upon actual comics which are meant to be dark (ex: The Dark Knight Returns, Injustice, etc.). Its like complaining that Game of Thrones (the TV series) sucks because they kill off too many characters. Read the books! Its frustrating to see such a beautiful work of art like Batman V Superman criticized by those ignorant to its universe and its meaning. This movie is in fact a catalyst that opens numerous doorways and leaves true fans in awe of the possibilities for future movies. But regardless of whether or not people choose to educate themselves, this film's DVD/Blu-ray extended version puts the theater release to shame. All of the plot holes and gaps are filled in 30 minutes of extended footage scattered throughout the film. The movie ultimately becomes more complete and people will wish that the movie had shown the full 3 hours of footage in its theatrical debut. As a major DC comics fan, I will of course pick up on things that a comics fan would not, but someone who does not read comics would learn to appreciate this film in its entirety with the extended version. Get your hands on a copy today or find it on Netflix or the internet somewhere!"

"I ignored the bad reviews and watched anyways. This film had a lot to live up to after Civil War was released and I went into this film expecting the worst. It ended up to be the best Superhero film of 2016 to me. One complaint was that this film was more concerned about universe building than telling a great story than Civil War but for me it was the other way around; Civil War felt like a build up to something else and to be honest, I felt that way when I saw the other MCU films. Batman vs Superman however not only had a great story, but it also felt a lot more consistent than Civil War. This film was way more diverse with the cast than the MCU but unlike the MCU, I felt like this film doesn't go overboard with the SJW stuff like the MCU films or The Star Wars Sequel films do. The Visuals were AMAZING, The Score by Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL was AMAZING as well, The Tone is just right as I actually felt for the characters emotionally, The Cinematography kept my eyes glued to the screen, and the script felt really Intelligent and Complex and despite people calling the writing confusing, I was able to piece it together with no problem whatsoever. This film is similar to Empire Strikes back in terms of popularity so over time after the other movies are released, this movie would probably be more popular.This film was way better than I Expected and deserves another chance.

"Its shame to see what critics and marvel fans did to this movie and targeted Zack Snyder for it. I have seen this movie more than 25 times till date. And i enjoy this movie as much as i enjoyed the first time. The fans who have read DC comics, wouldn't be disappointed in this movie. Its dark movie, yes it is. Because the title shows the intense situation at hand. Two superheroes about to rip each other apart for whatever reasons that brought them to this stage. Yes it had to be dark and intense.Only marvel can be stupid enough to show an alien invasion where humans are loosing the battle and the super heroes are cracking jokes while battles as if they are playing ping pong. a person playing Call of Duty game is more serious while playing than the marvel heroes fighting aliens."

"Last week some news came out from somebody online who had claimed to have seen a finished version of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. If you were like me, you've been leery of checking it out because you weren't sure how much might actually be true. Now Zack Snyder has spoken out about the spoiler-filled post, although his response doesn't really clear anything up.In a word, to MTV, he called the post \"hilarious,which might imply that he's saying that it's mostly, if not entirely, untrue. That might be the case, but then again he could have just said it was untrue and he didn't say that. What he did say, however, is that he doesn't like spoilers. While this may seem odd for the director who's most recent trailer appeared to give away the entire movie, Snyder says that's not the case. Even if you've seen the trailer, you can rest easy, as there is much more we have not seen in then finished film. Says Snyder I have the benefit of seeing the movie. It's cool that think it's too much, and I appreciate people not wanting to know, but there's plenty that they don't know. There's a lot of movie that's not in the trailer. In the process of calling the Batman v Superman Reddit review hilarious, Snyder goes on to talk about how he hates it when spoilers come out. The director would much rather that fans see the movie mostly blind. While he understands that some fans may wish to find the answers before hand, he wants his movies to be mysteries going in. If you're, as an audience member, exploring these articles, looking for answers to questions that you have, maybe you're okay with knowing before you go. It's like an individual taste. But like I said, I want people to see the movie without knowing.Spoilers are a topic that mean different things to different people. While most try to avoid them to some degree, the need to solve the mystery is a nearly universal human experience. We have an inclination to want to know the truth, even while also wanting to be surprised. For most of us getting some information is good, but getting all the information is bad, of course, only getting the details that you want can be difficult."
"The theatrical is choppy, poorly edited, hard to follow, with some really good moments mixed in their. The extended is much more fluent and is much easier to follow, it does have a long runtime, which might make it seem a bit dragging on, but if you like long films done right, like Lord of the Rings, you will like this movie as long as you get into the characters and story. Speaking of which, the story starts out perfectly showing Bruce Wayne as a character, and it is very powerful. There are several moments in this movie that are powerful, emotional, and shocking. Characters. Batman is my favorite fictional character of all time, and believe me when I say, Ben Affleck as Batman was perfect, he had the charisma, the anger, and the look of being through some bad stuff Gal Gadot also does perfect as Wonder Woman, but if you want to really see how good she does, go watch the Wonder Woman movie. Henry Call as Superman. I really don't like it when people say Christopher Reeves is better. Don't get me wrong, Reeves does great, but can you imagine him as Superman in this movie? I wouldn't like it. It would be like Adam West playing Batman in The Dark Knight. Henry Cavill does great in this role, I can say everything about him as I said with Ben Affleck. Jesse Eisenberg as Luthor. I thought it was different in a good way. I've heard a criticism for him as being too much like Joker, but is that a bad thing? Joker is my favorite villain, so to see Superman have an enemy that crazy, but still hold the values Luthor needs to be Luthor, I think it is great. The thing I thought this movie was lacking in the first and second acts was humor, at least good humor. If there was more humor, I would've given this movie a ten because it would give a more relaxing feel to the parts that needed it. All in all though, this movie was awesome, it had powerful moments, it was badass, and just plain fun. It had a great story arc and does its job very well."

"*I will be talking about the Ultimate Edition of the film* This was one of the most anticipated CBM of all time. Ever since the arrival and subsequent success of Marvel's The Avengers people have wondered when will DC launch its own cinematic universe, one of the main reasons being the opportunity to finally see titans such as Batman and Superman share the screen together: the ultimate nerd dream. On 2016, the moment finally came for BvS to be released AND.. it performed poorly. Not only did critical reception left a lot to be desired, but fan reactions where surprisingly split after its cinematic debut. People either loved it and called Zack a genius, or hated it and called him a hack. Me, personally, I found myself with middle of the road feelings, for sure, but more leaning towards the negative side with subsequent viewings. The theatrical cut of the film showcased amazing performances, incredible visuals, and action set pieces that seemed like comic book panels come to life, in a good way. However, when it comes to its narrative structure and more technical aspects like editing, the film was seriously flawed. More plot holes than Age of Ultron, questionable character decisions, random editing that lacked cohesion and focus, and forced dramatic moments that lacked any impact because the attempts at character development ranged from limited to nonexistent, especially when it comes to Superman's character. I thought it was a 5/10 movie at best. As such, I was kind of skeptical about the idea of a 30 minute longer version. I say kind of because I know how Zack works. I remember Watchmen being vastly improved with its director's cut, so in a way I was expecting BvS to perform in a similar manner, but I also feared those 30 minutes wold be just there to amplify action and discredit storytelling issues. Oh boy, I'm so glad I was proved wrong. The ultimate cut of the film was infuriating, but not because it was awful, but because it questions the sanity of WB executives and editors and makes you wonder what were they thinking during the editing process. What I got out of the Ultimate Edition was a thought-provoking deconstruction of two very iconic superheroes that gave spotlight to the struggles both of them face when they aren't fighting crime. What I got was an extremely well produced character study on both Batman and Superman in a cynical world, a world dangerously close to our own. We meet Batman as a ruthless, worn out hero that has seen the failure behind his ideals and witnessed some truly horrifying things in his life. Superman, on the other hand, is portrayed as a godlike figure that seeks to do good in the world, but finds himself emotionally conflicted once he realized that every good deed he does leaves behind a trail of destruction (most of it due to Luthor's antics). In my opinion, this is a hugely original approach, one that distances itself from the rest of the competition and delivers a dark, somber, yet relevant superhero movie that understands both characters and gives them real human struggles to deal with. I felt invested in both of them, and hoped that by the end of the film both could find a way to redeem themselves. Their character arcs were very well established during the first two acts of the movie, and by the time we get to the titular climactic battle the emotion behind the jaw-dropping action is intensified. Lex Luthor as a villain was also given more time to develop with this new edition. One of the main criticisms with the original version was the fact that his plan relied too much on conveniences, and the character's mannerisms and mad-scientist attitude was annoying, and that goes without saying his motivations were unclear. Not only do we spend more time understanding his hate for any godlike figure and thus his hatred for Superman, but the added scenes allowed us to witness his entire plan come to fruition. It sells the cold, manipulative, calculating attributes of his comic counterpart. The acting is spot on. Every actor owns his/her role, from Cavill's Superman, to Ben Affleck as Batman, Eisenberg as Luthor, and Gadot as Wonder Woman, whose scenes are brief, but are more than enough to sell the strong and ferocious warrior that she is. Cinematography is stunning, and miles above that of Man of Steel's. And the soundtrack by Zimmer and Junkie XL? Perfect, just perfect. When it comes to flaws, the film still has some of those. The Martha moment, while serving as a pivotal character moment for Batman, felt off in execution, and its understandable that many people got mad at it. If your main complaint about BvS the first time around was its bleak tone and subject matter, this film is still not for you. I understand most were expecting to see the heroes being the most iconic versions of themselves, clashing in an elongated battle and evoking the same feelings The Avengers gave audiences back in 2012. In that sense, the film will remain divisive, but at least I have the comfort of saying that, at the very least, the film is competently made."

"This film was amazing. Ben Affleck was easily the best part of this movie, he brought his a-game as Batman. The chemistry between Affleck & Irons was outstanding. Gal Gadot did a great job as Wonder Woman. The fight between Batman & Superman was awesome. The final fight with Doomsday was outstanding in every way possible. However, there is only one problem with this film and that's Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor. He was sadly missed cast in this role, but then again it's really the fault of Warner Bros. Studios. Overall, this film deliver on almost every level. I highly recommend that you watch the extended version of this film."

"I know I know. I saw it in theaters too, and felt like it could've been so much better. While the Batman element was good, the narrative felt fractured, and the third act was just one long stunt scene. Superman was relegated to a supporting character, and other characters didn't get a chance to shine. And then I chanced on the ultimate cut. Calling it 30 mins of \"extra\" footage is unfair to Zack Snyder because it's exactly these 30 mins that makes the movie a worthy one. What I can say about the theatrical cut is this - It had the blockbuster elements - music, visuals, stunts, CGI. But, it lacked the human elements. The first 20 mins of the movie had it, but not after that. The extended cut in comparison has a flow to the narrative. There are no disjointed scenes, everything flows smoothly, and there's connective tissue. Superman gets to spend some time with his father, and mother. Clark Kent does some investigative journalism. Superman helps the people after the blast. Lois Lane doesn't jump to conclusions, she gets to the bottom of the crime. Lex Luthor apparently had a coherent plan - everything is explained pretty well. Wonder Woman was already good, so there's no change there :) Also, the \"Martha\" scene seems better executed, because it is a few seconds longer, and there's time to breathe it in. So, here's my take on this movie - The theatrical cut was junk. Get the Bluray for ultimate edition, and you shall not be disappointed. I've seen it so many more times now, and it's the definitive cut. It is the movie we deserve. It's a unique take on Batman, and Superman. It's a gritty take on the superhero movie genre, and definitely the best DCEU movie, and the best DC movie since The Dark Knight.P.S. Yes it's dark. We're adults, and we should appreciate mature film making without intentionally silly moments. It attempts to be philosophical, and something deep instead of just trying to make you chuckle."

"This is one of the best superhero movies ever made. Zack Snyder is a magician behind the camera.The reason behind so many complaints is the fact that Warner Bros. marketed this movie as a fight between Batman and Superman. That's not what it is. It's a movie about the origins of the Justice League.The cinematography, the acting and the score are all second to none. This film is phenomenal.P.S: watch the 3 hour extended cut that Snyder intended you to see, not the 2 and a half hour movie that Warner Bros. decided would be better for theaters."

"I don't care what the critics say, this is a very well-done movie. I'll start my review by listing what I like about the movie.1.) Ben Affleck is the best batman to me and it is not close. He pulls off the role of an aging batman extremely well. Also, Zack Snyder's vision of batman is legit. I have always hated batman up until this adaptation of him. Instead of being a conflicted and idealistic batman, this batman is dark, gritty, and 100% a badass. His equipment is decked out with machine guns and he has no aversion to killing people. In fact, he probably kills about 50 criminal by the time this movie is over. The warehouse scene is the coolest batman scene in any movie.2.) The development of a grudge between batman and superman is pulled off flawlessly. It actually makes sense why batman dislikes superman. Then, when they do fight it is about the coolest thing you can expect to see from a superhero film. 3.) I disagree with a lot of people about Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor. In my opinion, he played his role to perfection. 4.) B v S sets up Wonder Woman and Justice League with Gal Gadot's cameo as Wonder Woman and short clips of Aquaman, the Flash, and Cyborg. B v S is one of my favorite superhero films and rewatching it never gets old."

"The theatrical cut of this film is garbage which is why I rated it eight stars instead of nine. The first time I watched this film I didn't like it (not straight out hate but didn't like). Character motivations didn't make any sense, Lex was annoying as s***, editing was sloppy, and it was overly dark and broody for an action superhero movie. A year + a half, five Marvel films, a ton of bad reviews and a Justice League later a thought popped into my head: \"what if I watched BVS again\". This time I didn't have trailers ruining the best moments, I only vaguely remembered the film, and I was conditioned to look at it negatively but something unexpected happened: I actually loved it. Superman was just a normal person that tried to make a difference cause he could that others imposed their own beliefs on. Lex Luthor was a genius that couldn't stand his powerlessness compared to Superman or more accurately a super being. As Alfred said \"The fever, the rage, the feeling of powerlessness that turns good men... cruel\" and you see the same thought process in Batman. Batman, just like Lex Luthor feels powerless in the midst of a god-being and just like Lex he attempts to destroy him so he can get his sense of power back but unlike Lex, Batman learns something. I what is one of the corniest lines of the movie Superman says, \"Martha\" when he knows he can't win against Batman in a late desperate attempt to save his mother. Not only does this name connect with Bruce Wayne but it also shows what really matters to a man of steel: it isn't power, it isn't fame or anything else, it is his Mother and on a broader scale it is people. Lex (who doesn't care about people at all) knows he doesn't have the power so he creates something from his blood and the remains of Zod: A Doomsday for Superman. Not only does this film have depth but it also doesn't always explain it to you which is rare in a blockbuster action superhero flick normally cater to semi-comic book fans and people that want to shove popcorn in their mouths. This film rewards you for really noticing the details while still having massive explosions. One of my favorites is how Lex has all of Batman's branded killed which is why he isn't afraid of the branding at the end or Grandma's Peach Tea as a way of scaring the s*** out of someone. Of course, this film isn't perfect and I do have personal dislikes. The Batman V Superman fight was slow and pretty boring especially after watching such an amazing fight in Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 2 (If you haven't watched the animated Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 1 and 2 you are sorely missing out on something fantastic). Also, the addition of Wonder Woman who pretty much steals a hacker thing, gives it back and then suits up and fights against a giant monster thing. Not to say I don't like Wonder Woman (She is one of my favorite Superheroes of all time who showed not only can woman kick a** but they also don't need to be ashamed of their sexuality or gender) but she wasn't really that helpful to the plot and just brought in to expand the universe which was well done through Lex's superhuman hunting files. Also, the post-apocalyptic scene that was just a dream could have been cut but nothing is perfect except movies like Citizen Kane which isn't a lot of fun to watch cause it is too perfect. So to summarize, the theatrical cut is bad, the ultimate cut is Amazing and the other cut is meh. Please give it a second chance because it deserves it and save a good director from losing grace because of something he didn't do."
"I really liked it, don't know what all the hate is about. I'm actually a Marvel fan from when I was 7 or so, but Superman and Batman together in 1 movie? Just great. And personally I like Ben Affleck even better than Christian Bale as Batman. So just watch and enjoy, I know I did!"

"That's right. We have been waiting for these two heroes to finally meet and fight against each other. This movie is so good in both plot and special effects.Henry Cavill and Ben Affleck have performed well in their acting stages. They are the best superhero actors and they have filmed their fighting scenes very well. The movie starts to show the conflict between the lives of the heroes and now they have blamed each other for it. This movie is amazing and sets up a good plot for Dawn Justice."

"Actually...I didn't know what to expect. When you see Wonder Woman, you know it will be off of Wonder Woman and off of a Wonder Woman story, but with Batman V Superman, I was like, \"hmmmm, so who is this about?\" It was pretty obvious that it would feature many characters, but I thought the introduction to Batman was amazing. Ben Affleck nailed the part, not only as Batman but also as Bruce Wayne. He is my Batman. Henry Cavill continued to be super as the Man of Steel. And he is my Super - Man. A dark story? Yes, without a doubt. Could it have had a few more jokes? Sure. But not all movies or stories need to have jokes when certain events are serious. I really hope people can see this review and take another look at the movie, because, I loved it. I really hope the ratings can go up, eventually. And P.S, this movie is the perfect set up to Justice League."

"I'll start by making it clear I have only ever seen the Ultimate Edition. I'm aware of what was cut out for the theatrical release, so I will concede up front that most of the criticisms about pacing, editing, and missing bits of plot at release were merited.With that caveat out of the way, I must reiterate that this was bar-none the boldest superhero movie I have ever seen. To me, it was arguably the best as well, though \"best\" shouldn't be taken to mean \"most enjoyable.\" That honor easily goes to \"Thor: Ragnarok.\" What makes BvS stand out among other films in the genre is that it takes two characters who have been done to death since the 1970s and brings them up to date. I recently tried to watch \"Superman: The Movie\" for the first time in a number of years, and while it was still good and Reeves will always be iconic, I just couldn't take it seriously. I'll put it this way: If the story in BvS was \"stupid\" in your view but Superman turning back time by spinning the earth backward on its axis didn't seem like one of the dumbest things you have ever seen -in any movie from any genre- to the extent that it outright ruins the movie for you, then your opinion about BvS isn't worth much. Nostalgic bias was always going to be a problem for this movie, and the way people reacted to and reviewed \"Man of Steel\" was telling in this regard.That brings me to Zack Snyder's take on Superman. You know, that guy whose status as the first extraterrestrial ever encountered by humanity was a total non-issue in the old movies. Apparently, Snyder has a similar view to my own in that his take on the Man of Steel makes his being an alien a core piece of his identity. He may look like any other (absurdly attractive) person, but he knows what he is, and that makes him perpetually uncertain of where he fits in this world. He is essentially good and really does care about people, but he struggles to truly empathize with the likes of us. To be human is to be frail, and that is not something he can easily relate to. This is the root of his conflict with Batman.Just as Clark struggles to genuinely relate to most people, Snyder's Batman either refuses to or otherwise just can't relate to Superman. He doesn't see him as anything but a threat regardless of Superman's clear good intentions. Remember, a small group of Kryptonians were able to bring humanity to the brink of extinction in less than a day, and Bruce Wayne is nothing if not a realist. He didn't know the guy from Kansas. He only knew the god from another world.While Batman's anger toward and fear of Superman are readily apparent from the start, Superman's inability to imagine things from Bruce Wayne's perspective only becomes truly apparent during their first real interaction. This reminded me of the animated version of the \"world's finest\" storyline, where Superman judges Batman harshly for using fear tactics and threats of violence (also, actual violence) to get the job done. Superman wasn't willing to consider what it would take for a human man to fight criminals and save innocents, or what that life would do to him over time. Just as Batman didn't see the guy from Kansas, Superman didn't see the man who lives his life trapped in one brutal, unthinkably traumatic moment (this was beautifully conveyed during the film's opening moments), and had spent his whole adult life bearing witness to humanity at its absolute worst.The conflict between these two characters is as old as human history. They want the same things, but they can't understand one another. So they fight. And what a fight it was.Watching a fight between, say, Captain America and Iron Man was, to me, more frustrating than anything because each understood the other's perspective perfectly. The fight between Batman and Superman in BvS was genuinely gut-wrenching, as intended, because they would have understood one another if either had tried. The whole sequence hilighted Batman's tactical prowess and ability to control a situation. Maybe the most badass thing about the fight was that it ended exactly where Batman planned. That brings me to the big elephant in the room named \"Martha.\"I can't recall exactly which YouTuber put it this way, but if you thought the \"save Martha\" exchange was about their mothers having the same name, you had your brain turned off. The brain-on people have explained this to death, but it bears repeating. This was the moment when Superman became humanized to Batman. He was about to die, and his only concern was for his adoptive human mother. He still believed that the man about to take his life would do the right thing. Even with the cowl on, there was no mistaking the look on Batman's face. It was the look of shame, guilt, and sudden uncertainty that says \"What am I doing?\" Turns out even the most brutal, angry version of Bruce Wayne is better than Tony Stark at knowing right from wrong. At knowing that he had gone too far.From there, the third act was a series of truly impressive (albeit mostly CGI) fight sequences, beginning with what I regard as the undisputed champion of Batman fights. Nothing in the Nolan movies (and especially nothing in the Burton movies) even came close. Go ahead, try to convince yourself that Batman and Bane taking turns punching one another in the face until Bane's mask broke was a good fight sequence. No, this was a fight straight out of \"Arkham Knight,\" and it was glorious. The battle against Doomsday really was one for the books. From the moment Wonder Woman arrived accompanied by the intense sounds of Tina Guo's electric cello to Superman's tragic, heroic death at the hands of Doomsday, I was glued to the screen. Sure, the mere presence of Doomsday spoiled the end to a degree, but watching the Man of Steel laboring to carry that kryptonite spear towards certain death was no less impactful. A brief word on Jesse Eisenberg's take on Lex Luthor. At least one other reviewer on this site already said it best when they pointed out that this was his origin story. If you consider his scheme objectively, he is actually one of the more formidable incarnations of the character. If we're lucky, we'll eventually get to see a Snyder Cut of \"Justice League\" and find out where this story was actually meant to go. For the record, Joss Whedon and Danny Elfman both should have said \"no\" to taking a dump on someone else's art."
"BATMAN V SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE brings a fantastic surprise to a smash-hit team-up with one of the worlds most beloved DC Comics' icons of all time. The movie delivers spectacular casting, and fantastic acting with different characters having their shine in each scenes.The story follows Clark Kent/Superman who becomes a threat, after the destruction in Metropolis in Man Of Steel.(2013). Batman/Bruce Wayne sees him as a threat and begins his war on Superman.The movie brings spectacular storytelling, it tells the complications of human against alien who are on the same side, and the first meeting of Batman and Superman. The story of Bruce Wayne, with his many years of The Caped Crusader, sends him on a spiral of \"out of control\", sheer anger, and builds tension to wanting to defeat the Man of Steel. Snyder has fantastically gave this storytelling an exciting nod to the comics.Lex Luthor, played by Jesse Einsberg, delivers a very interesting performance, but very differently by him showing is his \"origin\" before he becomes a bald foe to the Man of Steel. He shows that his love of \"god vs man\" terrorises mankind when he ultimately creates Doomsday, and Batman realises Superman's inner heroism.It packs so many great \"out of nowhere\" excitement, including a first-look of the fearful Wonder Woman a.k.a. Diana Prince, played by Gal Gadot, and a fresh-new glimpse of the superhero DC canon: The Justice League.WATCH THIS MOVIE! The critics are out of their mind. It's a fun-packed action adventure which still keeps the movie enjoyable until it's final minutes of the movie. It's a FANTASTIC MOVIE! BEN AFFLECK AS BATMAN... is Incredible!A 10/10 overall!"
"I want to go on record as saying that this is a truly thrilling cinematic experience in so many ways. If pressed, I guess I could acknowledge that there were a couple ... let's say \"clumsy\" moments. And in a film that runs to three hours, that hardly seems like a significant issue, certainly not enough to rate it with fewer than 9 stars.This film has everything. There is dramatic tension right from the start. There is a magnificent story arc that picks up quite seamlessly from 'Man of Steel' and propels the viewer not only into the life of Clark Kent/Superman but also of Bruce Wayne/Batman.The villain is no mere cartoon of a villain; he is truly thoroughly (and apparently irrevocably) diabolical. He is a psychopath, and you wish for his death over and over and over. You want Superman to reduce him to ash with the power of his eyes.I have read a number of viewers' reviews, and it seems that the people who disliked the film / gave it a low rating had rather unfair and unrealistic expectations of it. That is, their own prejudices about how the plot could/should unfold or what the character development could/should be, etc. ruined the film for them. And that is a shame.My thought is: I settle into my seat, wait for the lights to dim, and then I wait to be transported by the film. I accept it, lock, stock, and barrel.As another reviewer remarked, I love how the film begins from the point of view of Bruce Wayne as he is among people on the ground who have fallen victim to the attack of Zod and the other Kryptonians.Why would Bruce Wayne not like Superman? Why would the good people of Earth hurl insults at Superman and burn him in effigy (on the news)? Because the good people of Earth just got catapulted into a new reality in which there are not only extraterrestrial beings (surprise!) but they are also superman! And a group of them are hell-bent on destroying humankind and taking the planet for themselves.It is difficult to see Superman as separate from the whole Kryptonian Krew.It seems that many moviegoers forgot that Bruce Wayne is also human. Sure, he's a hero, but he is flawed.. Just like the rest of us. He is a vigilante, after all.He has let his vigilantism get the better of him. HE is actually the one working outside the boundaries of the law, not Superman. It is the clear head of Alfred that shows us that he has gone into a rather dark place, that he has not seen what is really going on (in Luthor's scheme), and so he chooses to embark on his own scheme scheme to take out the alien invader. He is (allegedly) thinking of the future: if he wipes out the all-powerful alien, then it can't turn on humankind in the future. At least, he convinces himself of that.A philosophical question is raised in the film: should Clark Kent have remained a simple man from Kansas and never have become the Superman? Should he just let people die and let calamities happen? The question is answered for us in the character of Diana Prince/Wonder Woman. She withdrew from mankind (her exact words) and just sat around watching. Watching while people died horrible deaths all around her. So, should Superman have done the same? Do these special beings, these 'metahumans', have some kind of moral imperative to intervene, or should they be allowed to be regular people, too? It seems that humans want it both ways.It seems that humans are saying: \"Don't be a superalien ... except when I and my friends and family are in trouble. Then come save us.\""

"Batman v Superman: Ultimate Edition: If your looking for a quick, cheap thrill then you might not enjoy this film at the time. This movies theatrical version was butchered by WB and in doing so reshaped the story leaving numerous plot holes. So the Ultimate Edition is the full story and the one worth seeing. Watch 'Man of Steel' before seeing this movie. There is much to claw through here, so much so that the audience might easily find themselves exhausted from the overall aggression of the film. However, a lot of the story does work. The action is good, and the emotion feels real most of the time.This film is about Superman trying to become Superman. Trying to help the world, save people, find a place in this world not as an outcast, and yet is looked at has a threat by many. Superman is not from this world, yet He is trying to be human, find a place in this world, be excepted by earths people, and come into his destiny.This film is also about Batman being Batman for 20 years and losing faith in humanity, and fearing Superman, what Superman can do with his powers. Great film, great plot, great visuals. ---Yidioo"
"I didn't see the film in the theaters and just bought the \"Extended Edition \" on Amazon. I never properly saw Man of Steel- i think I rented it and watched it when already exhausted and fell asleep. I saw the mediocre user reviews and horrible reviews from critics of this film.They really have it wrong. This is the very best either Batman or Superman. It has a different take, on things. Much darker then earlier films even darker then the Christopher Nolan Batman films.First of all Christopher Nolan is an Executive Producer. So how bad could it be? I loved Sucker Punch and Zack Snyder was involved with that. So how bad could this be? Hans Zimmer did the music, so how bad could it be?I remember watching the old Superman TV shows and reading the Superman and Batman comics as a little kid and loved them, but i wouldn't call myself a \"fan boy\" of comic universes, like so many younger people today. As an older adult I will admit my favorite TV show of all time was Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but watched it on DVD only after it had finished. I saw the second of the Dark Knight series in the theater, but the other two, I watched on DVD. They were great, but not my favorite films like so many people. i also loved the first couple Superman and Batman films in the older series. Regardless, i was not waiting with baited breath to see Man of Steel or this one.I'm more of a serious film fan, who can watch Stanley Kubrick films over and over and my favorite films in the last twenty years, are Eyes Wide Shut and Intersteller, both of which i've watched multiple times.So, with that said, take it from me, the critics have this film very wrong, just as critics hated 2001: A Space Odyssey when it first came out. This film will have lasting appreciation.Surprised how much I liked Ben Afleck's Batman. it was hard to get into Henry Cavil's scrawnier looking Superman, but it grew on me. Amy Adams was great as Lois Lane, The Gal Gadol Wonder Women was amazing. Lex Luther was terrific, like Nolan's Joker. Jeremy Irons was the best Alfred ever. Holly Hunter and Diane Lane was good too. The movie had bad reviews but made a billion dollars. Hopefully everyone buys the Ultimate Edition and it breaks sales records and the film is re-appreciated. I have no idea what scenes this Ultimate Edition added, but it is pretty perfect. Now I can't wait for Wonder Woman and the Justice League and as soon as I finish writing this am going to watch Man of Steal. I'm into it now!I can only surmise that the bad reviews stem from too much expectations of the rigid fan boy types and the radical changes in tone, we see in this film.Total masterpiece of cinema, but I have a few criticisms. There are a few hollow scenes of typical Idiot cops and authorities getting everything wrong in a cliché type way and it has a few filler scenes of that type and a few moments here and there that felt rushed and cheesy. Maybe not everything restored into the Ultimate Edition should have been. I wish there had been more Kevin Costner scenes."

"The whole entire Batman V Superman movie was great and yes even though it felt slow to the majority of the people who watched it but to me I enjoyed every part and every scene of Batman V Superman and when it got to the fight scenes both batman VS Superman and the Doomsday fight it brought so much drama, intensity, and epic performances. So with that being said I give this movie a good 10/10 because it really did go to my expectations and it brought a powerful performance and a powerful yet epic introduction to the upcoming Justice League."

"When I first wrote a review for this movie a year ago exclaiming my excitement for the film, I had been high off a fresh dose of live-action DC superheroes playing out the beloved comic book stories that I had grown up on. It was all playing out before my eyes and coming to life. After a few months had passed, I began to notice things about the movie that I disliked: little gaps in the story, things that didn't add up, etc. My original rating of a 10 / 10 dropped to an 8 /10. But today it has gone back up to a 10. The extended version of the film not only rectifies the gaps but also silences critics.Many claimed that the movie was too dark or that it just didn't make sense. To those people, I say: \"Pick up a comic book!\" Many of the critics of this particular film were part of the superhero bandwagon that formed when Marvel began its spree of Avengers-related films. In fact, its estimated that over 60% of people who go to see 'superhero' genre films have never picked up a comic book in their life. I would argue that similar numbers could figure to those which view the CW televised DC Universe shows. People complain that DC comics is just too dark but the fact is that these movies are based upon actual comics which are meant to be dark (ex: The Dark Knight Returns, Injustice, etc.). Its like complaining that Game of Thrones (the TV series) sucks because they kill off too many characters. Read the books! Its frustrating to see such a beautiful work of art like Batman V Superman criticized by those ignorant to its universe and its meaning. This movie is in fact a catalyst that opens numerous doorways and leaves true fans in awe of the possibilities for future movies. But regardless of whether or not people choose to educate themselves, this film's DVD/Blu-ray extended version puts the theater release to shame. All of the plot holes and gaps are filled in 30 minutes of extended footage scattered throughout the film. The movie ultimately becomes more complete and people will wish that the movie had shown the full 3 hours of footage in its theatrical debut. As a major DC comics fan, I will of course pick up on things that a comics fan would not, but someone who does not read comics would learn to appreciate this film in its entirety with the extended version. Get your hands on a copy today or find it on Netflix or the internet somewhere!"

"I ignored the bad reviews and watched anyways. This film had a lot to live up to after Civil War was released and I went into this film expecting the worst. It ended up to be the best Superhero film of 2016 to me. One complaint was that this film was more concerned about universe building than telling a great story than Civil War but for me it was the other way around; Civil War felt like a build up to something else and to be honest, I felt that way when I saw the other MCU films. Batman vs Superman however not only had a great story, but it also felt a lot more consistent than Civil War. This film was way more diverse with the cast than the MCU but unlike the MCU, I felt like this film doesn't go overboard with the SJW stuff like the MCU films or The Star Wars Sequel films do. The Visuals were AMAZING, The Score by Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL was AMAZING as well, The Tone is just right as I actually felt for the characters emotionally, The Cinematography kept my eyes glued to the screen, and the script felt really Intelligent and Complex and despite people calling the writing confusing, I was able to piece it together with no problem whatsoever. This film is similar to Empire Strikes back in terms of popularity so over time after the other movies are released, this movie would probably be more popular.This film was way better than I Expected and deserves another chance.

"Its shame to see what critics and marvel fans did to this movie and targeted Zack Snyder for it. I have seen this movie more than 25 times till date. And i enjoy this movie as much as i enjoyed the first time. The fans who have read DC comics, wouldn't be disappointed in this movie. Its dark movie, yes it is. Because the title shows the intense situation at hand. Two superheroes about to rip each other apart for whatever reasons that brought them to this stage. Yes it had to be dark and intense.Only marvel can be stupid enough to show an alien invasion where humans are loosing the battle and the super heroes are cracking jokes while battles as if they are playing ping pong. a person playing Call of Duty game is more serious while playing than the marvel heroes fighting aliens."

"Last week some news came out from somebody online who had claimed to have seen a finished version of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. If you were like me, you've been leery of checking it out because you weren't sure how much might actually be true. Now Zack Snyder has spoken out about the spoiler-filled post, although his response doesn't really clear anything up.In a word, to MTV, he called the post \"hilarious,which might imply that he's saying that it's mostly, if not entirely, untrue. That might be the case, but then again he could have just said it was untrue and he didn't say that. What he did say, however, is that he doesn't like spoilers. While this may seem odd for the director who's most recent trailer appeared to give away the entire movie, Snyder says that's not the case. Even if you've seen the trailer, you can rest easy, as there is much more we have not seen in then finished film. Says Snyder I have the benefit of seeing the movie. It's cool that think it's too much, and I appreciate people not wanting to know, but there's plenty that they don't know. There's a lot of movie that's not in the trailer. In the process of calling the Batman v Superman Reddit review hilarious, Snyder goes on to talk about how he hates it when spoilers come out. The director would much rather that fans see the movie mostly blind. While he understands that some fans may wish to find the answers before hand, he wants his movies to be mysteries going in. If you're, as an audience member, exploring these articles, looking for answers to questions that you have, maybe you're okay with knowing before you go. It's like an individual taste. But like I said, I want people to see the movie without knowing.Spoilers are a topic that mean different things to different people. While most try to avoid them to some degree, the need to solve the mystery is a nearly universal human experience. We have an inclination to want to know the truth, even while also wanting to be surprised. For most of us getting some information is good, but getting all the information is bad, of course, only getting the details that you want can be difficult."
"The theatrical is choppy, poorly edited, hard to follow, with some really good moments mixed in their. The extended is much more fluent and is much easier to follow, it does have a long runtime, which might make it seem a bit dragging on, but if you like long films done right, like Lord of the Rings, you will like this movie as long as you get into the characters and story. Speaking of which, the story starts out perfectly showing Bruce Wayne as a character, and it is very powerful. There are several moments in this movie that are powerful, emotional, and shocking. Characters. Batman is my favorite fictional character of all time, and believe me when I say, Ben Affleck as Batman was perfect, he had the charisma, the anger, and the look of being through some bad stuff Gal Gadot also does perfect as Wonder Woman, but if you want to really see how good she does, go watch the Wonder Woman movie. Henry Call as Superman. I really don't like it when people say Christopher Reeves is better. Don't get me wrong, Reeves does great, but can you imagine him as Superman in this movie? I wouldn't like it. It would be like Adam West playing Batman in The Dark Knight. Henry Cavill does great in this role, I can say everything about him as I said with Ben Affleck. Jesse Eisenberg as Luthor. I thought it was different in a good way. I've heard a criticism for him as being too much like Joker, but is that a bad thing? Joker is my favorite villain, so to see Superman have an enemy that crazy, but still hold the values Luthor needs to be Luthor, I think it is great. The thing I thought this movie was lacking in the first and second acts was humor, at least good humor. If there was more humor, I would've given this movie a ten because it would give a more relaxing feel to the parts that needed it. All in all though, this movie was awesome, it had powerful moments, it was badass, and just plain fun. It had a great story arc and does its job very well."

"*I will be talking about the Ultimate Edition of the film* This was one of the most anticipated CBM of all time. Ever since the arrival and subsequent success of Marvel's The Avengers people have wondered when will DC launch its own cinematic universe, one of the main reasons being the opportunity to finally see titans such as Batman and Superman share the screen together: the ultimate nerd dream. On 2016, the moment finally came for BvS to be released AND.. it performed poorly. Not only did critical reception left a lot to be desired, but fan reactions where surprisingly split after its cinematic debut. People either loved it and called Zack a genius, or hated it and called him a hack. Me, personally, I found myself with middle of the road feelings, for sure, but more leaning towards the negative side with subsequent viewings. The theatrical cut of the film showcased amazing performances, incredible visuals, and action set pieces that seemed like comic book panels come to life, in a good way. However, when it comes to its narrative structure and more technical aspects like editing, the film was seriously flawed. More plot holes than Age of Ultron, questionable character decisions, random editing that lacked cohesion and focus, and forced dramatic moments that lacked any impact because the attempts at character development ranged from limited to nonexistent, especially when it comes to Superman's character. I thought it was a 5/10 movie at best. As such, I was kind of skeptical about the idea of a 30 minute longer version. I say kind of because I know how Zack works. I remember Watchmen being vastly improved with its director's cut, so in a way I was expecting BvS to perform in a similar manner, but I also feared those 30 minutes wold be just there to amplify action and discredit storytelling issues. Oh boy, I'm so glad I was proved wrong. The ultimate cut of the film was infuriating, but not because it was awful, but because it questions the sanity of WB executives and editors and makes you wonder what were they thinking during the editing process. What I got out of the Ultimate Edition was a thought-provoking deconstruction of two very iconic superheroes that gave spotlight to the struggles both of them face when they aren't fighting crime. What I got was an extremely well produced character study on both Batman and Superman in a cynical world, a world dangerously close to our own. We meet Batman as a ruthless, worn out hero that has seen the failure behind his ideals and witnessed some truly horrifying things in his life. Superman, on the other hand, is portrayed as a godlike figure that seeks to do good in the world, but finds himself emotionally conflicted once he realized that every good deed he does leaves behind a trail of destruction (most of it due to Luthor's antics). In my opinion, this is a hugely original approach, one that distances itself from the rest of the competition and delivers a dark, somber, yet relevant superhero movie that understands both characters and gives them real human struggles to deal with. I felt invested in both of them, and hoped that by the end of the film both could find a way to redeem themselves. Their character arcs were very well established during the first two acts of the movie, and by the time we get to the titular climactic battle the emotion behind the jaw-dropping action is intensified. Lex Luthor as a villain was also given more time to develop with this new edition. One of the main criticisms with the original version was the fact that his plan relied too much on conveniences, and the character's mannerisms and mad-scientist attitude was annoying, and that goes without saying his motivations were unclear. Not only do we spend more time understanding his hate for any godlike figure and thus his hatred for Superman, but the added scenes allowed us to witness his entire plan come to fruition. It sells the cold, manipulative, calculating attributes of his comic counterpart. The acting is spot on. Every actor owns his/her role, from Cavill's Superman, to Ben Affleck as Batman, Eisenberg as Luthor, and Gadot as Wonder Woman, whose scenes are brief, but are more than enough to sell the strong and ferocious warrior that she is. Cinematography is stunning, and miles above that of Man of Steel's. And the soundtrack by Zimmer and Junkie XL? Perfect, just perfect. When it comes to flaws, the film still has some of those. The Martha moment, while serving as a pivotal character moment for Batman, felt off in execution, and its understandable that many people got mad at it. If your main complaint about BvS the first time around was its bleak tone and subject matter, this film is still not for you. I understand most were expecting to see the heroes being the most iconic versions of themselves, clashing in an elongated battle and evoking the same feelings The Avengers gave audiences back in 2012. In that sense, the film will remain divisive, but at least I have the comfort of saying that, at the very least, the film is competently made."

"This film was amazing. Ben Affleck was easily the best part of this movie, he brought his a-game as Batman. The chemistry between Affleck & Irons was outstanding. Gal Gadot did a great job as Wonder Woman. The fight between Batman & Superman was awesome. The final fight with Doomsday was outstanding in every way possible. However, there is only one problem with this film and that's Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor. He was sadly missed cast in this role, but then again it's really the fault of Warner Bros. Studios. Overall, this film deliver on almost every level. I highly recommend that you watch the extended version of this film."

"I know I know. I saw it in theaters too, and felt like it could've been so much better. While the Batman element was good, the narrative felt fractured, and the third act was just one long stunt scene. Superman was relegated to a supporting character, and other characters didn't get a chance to shine. And then I chanced on the ultimate cut. Calling it 30 mins of \"extra\" footage is unfair to Zack Snyder because it's exactly these 30 mins that makes the movie a worthy one. What I can say about the theatrical cut is this - It had the blockbuster elements - music, visuals, stunts, CGI. But, it lacked the human elements. The first 20 mins of the movie had it, but not after that. The extended cut in comparison has a flow to the narrative. There are no disjointed scenes, everything flows smoothly, and there's connective tissue. Superman gets to spend some time with his father, and mother. Clark Kent does some investigative journalism. Superman helps the people after the blast. Lois Lane doesn't jump to conclusions, she gets to the bottom of the crime. Lex Luthor apparently had a coherent plan - everything is explained pretty well. Wonder Woman was already good, so there's no change there :) Also, the \"Martha\" scene seems better executed, because it is a few seconds longer, and there's time to breathe it in. So, here's my take on this movie - The theatrical cut was junk. Get the Bluray for ultimate edition, and you shall not be disappointed. I've seen it so many more times now, and it's the definitive cut. It is the movie we deserve. It's a unique take on Batman, and Superman. It's a gritty take on the superhero movie genre, and definitely the best DCEU movie, and the best DC movie since The Dark Knight.P.S. Yes it's dark. We're adults, and we should appreciate mature film making without intentionally silly moments. It attempts to be philosophical, and something deep instead of just trying to make you chuckle."

"This is one of the best superhero movies ever made. Zack Snyder is a magician behind the camera.The reason behind so many complaints is the fact that Warner Bros. marketed this movie as a fight between Batman and Superman. That's not what it is. It's a movie about the origins of the Justice League.The cinematography, the acting and the score are all second to none. This film is phenomenal.P.S: watch the 3 hour extended cut that Snyder intended you to see, not the 2 and a half hour movie that Warner Bros. decided would be better for theaters."

"I don't care what the critics say, this is a very well-done movie. I'll start my review by listing what I like about the movie.1.) Ben Affleck is the best batman to me and it is not close. He pulls off the role of an aging batman extremely well. Also, Zack Snyder's vision of batman is legit. I have always hated batman up until this adaptation of him. Instead of being a conflicted and idealistic batman, this batman is dark, gritty, and 100% a badass. His equipment is decked out with machine guns and he has no aversion to killing people. In fact, he probably kills about 50 criminal by the time this movie is over. The warehouse scene is the coolest batman scene in any movie.2.) The development of a grudge between batman and superman is pulled off flawlessly. It actually makes sense why batman dislikes superman. Then, when they do fight it is about the coolest thing you can expect to see from a superhero film. 3.) I disagree with a lot of people about Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor. In my opinion, he played his role to perfection. 4.) B v S sets up Wonder Woman and Justice League with Gal Gadot's cameo as Wonder Woman and short clips of Aquaman, the Flash, and Cyborg. B v S is one of my favorite superhero films and rewatching it never gets old."

"The theatrical cut of this film is garbage which is why I rated it eight stars instead of nine. The first time I watched this film I didn't like it (not straight out hate but didn't like). Character motivations didn't make any sense, Lex was annoying as s***, editing was sloppy, and it was overly dark and broody for an action superhero movie. A year + a half, five Marvel films, a ton of bad reviews and a Justice League later a thought popped into my head: \"what if I watched BVS again\". This time I didn't have trailers ruining the best moments, I only vaguely remembered the film, and I was conditioned to look at it negatively but something unexpected happened: I actually loved it. Superman was just a normal person that tried to make a difference cause he could that others imposed their own beliefs on. Lex Luthor was a genius that couldn't stand his powerlessness compared to Superman or more accurately a super being. As Alfred said \"The fever, the rage, the feeling of powerlessness that turns good men... cruel\" and you see the same thought process in Batman. Batman, just like Lex Luthor feels powerless in the midst of a god-being and just like Lex he attempts to destroy him so he can get his sense of power back but unlike Lex, Batman learns something. I what is one of the corniest lines of the movie Superman says, \"Martha\" when he knows he can't win against Batman in a late desperate attempt to save his mother. Not only does this name connect with Bruce Wayne but it also shows what really matters to a man of steel: it isn't power, it isn't fame or anything else, it is his Mother and on a broader scale it is people. Lex (who doesn't care about people at all) knows he doesn't have the power so he creates something from his blood and the remains of Zod: A Doomsday for Superman. Not only does this film have depth but it also doesn't always explain it to you which is rare in a blockbuster action superhero flick normally cater to semi-comic book fans and people that want to shove popcorn in their mouths. This film rewards you for really noticing the details while still having massive explosions. One of my favorites is how Lex has all of Batman's branded killed which is why he isn't afraid of the branding at the end or Grandma's Peach Tea as a way of scaring the s*** out of someone. Of course, this film isn't perfect and I do have personal dislikes. The Batman V Superman fight was slow and pretty boring especially after watching such an amazing fight in Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 2 (If you haven't watched the animated Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 1 and 2 you are sorely missing out on something fantastic). Also, the addition of Wonder Woman who pretty much steals a hacker thing, gives it back and then suits up and fights against a giant monster thing. Not to say I don't like Wonder Woman (She is one of my favorite Superheroes of all time who showed not only can woman kick a** but they also don't need to be ashamed of their sexuality or gender) but she wasn't really that helpful to the plot and just brought in to expand the universe which was well done through Lex's superhuman hunting files. Also, the post-apocalyptic scene that was just a dream could have been cut but nothing is perfect except movies like Citizen Kane which isn't a lot of fun to watch cause it is too perfect. So to summarize, the theatrical cut is bad, the ultimate cut is Amazing and the other cut is meh. Please give it a second chance because it deserves it and save a good director from losing grace because of something he didn't do."
"I really liked it, don't know what all the hate is about. I'm actually a Marvel fan from when I was 7 or so, but Superman and Batman together in 1 movie? Just great. And personally I like Ben Affleck even better than Christian Bale as Batman. So just watch and enjoy, I know I did!"

"That's right. We have been waiting for these two heroes to finally meet and fight against each other. This movie is so good in both plot and special effects.Henry Cavill and Ben Affleck have performed well in their acting stages. They are the best superhero actors and they have filmed their fighting scenes very well. The movie starts to show the conflict between the lives of the heroes and now they have blamed each other for it. This movie is amazing and sets up a good plot for Dawn Justice."

"Actually...I didn't know what to expect. When you see Wonder Woman, you know it will be off of Wonder Woman and off of a Wonder Woman story, but with Batman V Superman, I was like, \"hmmmm, so who is this about?\" It was pretty obvious that it would feature many characters, but I thought the introduction to Batman was amazing. Ben Affleck nailed the part, not only as Batman but also as Bruce Wayne. He is my Batman. Henry Cavill continued to be super as the Man of Steel. And he is my Super - Man. A dark story? Yes, without a doubt. Could it have had a few more jokes? Sure. But not all movies or stories need to have jokes when certain events are serious. I really hope people can see this review and take another look at the movie, because, I loved it. I really hope the ratings can go up, eventually. And P.S, this movie is the perfect set up to Justice League."

"I'll start by making it clear I have only ever seen the Ultimate Edition. I'm aware of what was cut out for the theatrical release, so I will concede up front that most of the criticisms about pacing, editing, and missing bits of plot at release were merited.With that caveat out of the way, I must reiterate that this was bar-none the boldest superhero movie I have ever seen. To me, it was arguably the best as well, though \"best\" shouldn't be taken to mean \"most enjoyable.\" That honor easily goes to \"Thor: Ragnarok.\" What makes BvS stand out among other films in the genre is that it takes two characters who have been done to death since the 1970s and brings them up to date. I recently tried to watch \"Superman: The Movie\" for the first time in a number of years, and while it was still good and Reeves will always be iconic, I just couldn't take it seriously. I'll put it this way: If the story in BvS was \"stupid\" in your view but Superman turning back time by spinning the earth backward on its axis didn't seem like one of the dumbest things you have ever seen -in any movie from any genre- to the extent that it outright ruins the movie for you, then your opinion about BvS isn't worth much. Nostalgic bias was always going to be a problem for this movie, and the way people reacted to and reviewed \"Man of Steel\" was telling in this regard.That brings me to Zack Snyder's take on Superman. You know, that guy whose status as the first extraterrestrial ever encountered by humanity was a total non-issue in the old movies. Apparently, Snyder has a similar view to my own in that his take on the Man of Steel makes his being an alien a core piece of his identity. He may look like any other (absurdly attractive) person, but he knows what he is, and that makes him perpetually uncertain of where he fits in this world. He is essentially good and really does care about people, but he struggles to truly empathize with the likes of us. To be human is to be frail, and that is not something he can easily relate to. This is the root of his conflict with Batman.Just as Clark struggles to genuinely relate to most people, Snyder's Batman either refuses to or otherwise just can't relate to Superman. He doesn't see him as anything but a threat regardless of Superman's clear good intentions. Remember, a small group of Kryptonians were able to bring humanity to the brink of extinction in less than a day, and Bruce Wayne is nothing if not a realist. He didn't know the guy from Kansas. He only knew the god from another world.While Batman's anger toward and fear of Superman are readily apparent from the start, Superman's inability to imagine things from Bruce Wayne's perspective only becomes truly apparent during their first real interaction. This reminded me of the animated version of the \"world's finest\" storyline, where Superman judges Batman harshly for using fear tactics and threats of violence (also, actual violence) to get the job done. Superman wasn't willing to consider what it would take for a human man to fight criminals and save innocents, or what that life would do to him over time. Just as Batman didn't see the guy from Kansas, Superman didn't see the man who lives his life trapped in one brutal, unthinkably traumatic moment (this was beautifully conveyed during the film's opening moments), and had spent his whole adult life bearing witness to humanity at its absolute worst.The conflict between these two characters is as old as human history. They want the same things, but they can't understand one another. So they fight. And what a fight it was.Watching a fight between, say, Captain America and Iron Man was, to me, more frustrating than anything because each understood the other's perspective perfectly. The fight between Batman and Superman in BvS was genuinely gut-wrenching, as intended, because they would have understood one another if either had tried. The whole sequence hilighted Batman's tactical prowess and ability to control a situation. Maybe the most badass thing about the fight was that it ended exactly where Batman planned. That brings me to the big elephant in the room named \"Martha.\"I can't recall exactly which YouTuber put it this way, but if you thought the \"save Martha\" exchange was about their mothers having the same name, you had your brain turned off. The brain-on people have explained this to death, but it bears repeating. This was the moment when Superman became humanized to Batman. He was about to die, and his only concern was for his adoptive human mother. He still believed that the man about to take his life would do the right thing. Even with the cowl on, there was no mistaking the look on Batman's face. It was the look of shame, guilt, and sudden uncertainty that says \"What am I doing?\" Turns out even the most brutal, angry version of Bruce Wayne is better than Tony Stark at knowing right from wrong. At knowing that he had gone too far.From there, the third act was a series of truly impressive (albeit mostly CGI) fight sequences, beginning with what I regard as the undisputed champion of Batman fights. Nothing in the Nolan movies (and especially nothing in the Burton movies) even came close. Go ahead, try to convince yourself that Batman and Bane taking turns punching one another in the face until Bane's mask broke was a good fight sequence. No, this was a fight straight out of \"Arkham Knight,\" and it was glorious. The battle against Doomsday really was one for the books. From the moment Wonder Woman arrived accompanied by the intense sounds of Tina Guo's electric cello to Superman's tragic, heroic death at the hands of Doomsday, I was glued to the screen. Sure, the mere presence of Doomsday spoiled the end to a degree, but watching the Man of Steel laboring to carry that kryptonite spear towards certain death was no less impactful. A brief word on Jesse Eisenberg's take on Lex Luthor. At least one other reviewer on this site already said it best when they pointed out that this was his origin story. If you consider his scheme objectively, he is actually one of the more formidable incarnations of the character. If we're lucky, we'll eventually get to see a Snyder Cut of \"Justice League\" and find out where this story was actually meant to go. For the record, Joss Whedon and Danny Elfman both should have said \"no\" to taking a dump on someone else's art."
"BATMAN V SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE brings a fantastic surprise to a smash-hit team-up with one of the worlds most beloved DC Comics' icons of all time. The movie delivers spectacular casting, and fantastic acting with different characters having their shine in each scenes.The story follows Clark Kent/Superman who becomes a threat, after the destruction in Metropolis in Man Of Steel.(2013). Batman/Bruce Wayne sees him as a threat and begins his war on Superman.The movie brings spectacular storytelling, it tells the complications of human against alien who are on the same side, and the first meeting of Batman and Superman. The story of Bruce Wayne, with his many years of The Caped Crusader, sends him on a spiral of \"out of control\", sheer anger, and builds tension to wanting to defeat the Man of Steel. Snyder has fantastically gave this storytelling an exciting nod to the comics.Lex Luthor, played by Jesse Einsberg, delivers a very interesting performance, but very differently by him showing is his \"origin\" before he becomes a bald foe to the Man of Steel. He shows that his love of \"god vs man\" terrorises mankind when he ultimately creates Doomsday, and Batman realises Superman's inner heroism.It packs so many great \"out of nowhere\" excitement, including a first-look of the fearful Wonder Woman a.k.a. Diana Prince, played by Gal Gadot, and a fresh-new glimpse of the superhero DC canon: The Justice League.WATCH THIS MOVIE! The critics are out of their mind. It's a fun-packed action adventure which still keeps the movie enjoyable until it's final minutes of the movie. It's a FANTASTIC MOVIE! BEN AFFLECK AS BATMAN... is Incredible!A 10/10 overall!"
"I want to go on record as saying that this is a truly thrilling cinematic experience in so many ways. If pressed, I guess I could acknowledge that there were a couple ... let's say \"clumsy\" moments. And in a film that runs to three hours, that hardly seems like a significant issue, certainly not enough to rate it with fewer than 9 stars.This film has everything. There is dramatic tension right from the start. There is a magnificent story arc that picks up quite seamlessly from 'Man of Steel' and propels the viewer not only into the life of Clark Kent/Superman but also of Bruce Wayne/Batman.The villain is no mere cartoon of a villain; he is truly thoroughly (and apparently irrevocably) diabolical. He is a psychopath, and you wish for his death over and over and over. You want Superman to reduce him to ash with the power of his eyes.I have read a number of viewers' reviews, and it seems that the people who disliked the film / gave it a low rating had rather unfair and unrealistic expectations of it. That is, their own prejudices about how the plot could/should unfold or what the character development could/should be, etc. ruined the film for them. And that is a shame.My thought is: I settle into my seat, wait for the lights to dim, and then I wait to be transported by the film. I accept it, lock, stock, and barrel.As another reviewer remarked, I love how the film begins from the point of view of Bruce Wayne as he is among people on the ground who have fallen victim to the attack of Zod and the other Kryptonians.Why would Bruce Wayne not like Superman? Why would the good people of Earth hurl insults at Superman and burn him in effigy (on the news)? Because the good people of Earth just got catapulted into a new reality in which there are not only extraterrestrial beings (surprise!) but they are also superman! And a group of them are hell-bent on destroying humankind and taking the planet for themselves.It is difficult to see Superman as separate from the whole Kryptonian Krew.It seems that many moviegoers forgot that Bruce Wayne is also human. Sure, he's a hero, but he is flawed.. Just like the rest of us. He is a vigilante, after all.He has let his vigilantism get the better of him. HE is actually the one working outside the boundaries of the law, not Superman. It is the clear head of Alfred that shows us that he has gone into a rather dark place, that he has not seen what is really going on (in Luthor's scheme), and so he chooses to embark on his own scheme scheme to take out the alien invader. He is (allegedly) thinking of the future: if he wipes out the all-powerful alien, then it can't turn on humankind in the future. At least, he convinces himself of that.A philosophical question is raised in the film: should Clark Kent have remained a simple man from Kansas and never have become the Superman? Should he just let people die and let calamities happen? The question is answered for us in the character of Diana Prince/Wonder Woman. She withdrew from mankind (her exact words) and just sat around watching. Watching while people died horrible deaths all around her. So, should Superman have done the same? Do these special beings, these 'metahumans', have some kind of moral imperative to intervene, or should they be allowed to be regular people, too? It seems that humans want it both ways.It seems that humans are saying: \"Don't be a superalien ... except when I and my friends and family are in trouble. Then come save us.\""

"Batman v Superman: Ultimate Edition: If your looking for a quick, cheap thrill then you might not enjoy this film at the time. This movies theatrical version was butchered by WB and in doing so reshaped the story leaving numerous plot holes. So the Ultimate Edition is the full story and the one worth seeing. Watch 'Man of Steel' before seeing this movie. There is much to claw through here, so much so that the audience might easily find themselves exhausted from the overall aggression of the film. However, a lot of the story does work. The action is good, and the emotion feels real most of the time.This film is about Superman trying to become Superman. Trying to help the world, save people, find a place in this world not as an outcast, and yet is looked at has a threat by many. Superman is not from this world, yet He is trying to be human, find a place in this world, be excepted by earths people, and come into his destiny.This film is also about Batman being Batman for 20 years and losing faith in humanity, and fearing Superman, what Superman can do with his powers. Great film, great plot, great visuals. ---Yidioo"
"I didn't see the film in the theaters and just bought the \"Extended Edition \" on Amazon. I never properly saw Man of Steel- i think I rented it and watched it when already exhausted and fell asleep. I saw the mediocre user reviews and horrible reviews from critics of this film.They really have it wrong. This is the very best either Batman or Superman. It has a different take, on things. Much darker then earlier films even darker then the Christopher Nolan Batman films.First of all Christopher Nolan is an Executive Producer. So how bad could it be? I loved Sucker Punch and Zack Snyder was involved with that. So how bad could this be? Hans Zimmer did the music, so how bad could it be?I remember watching the old Superman TV shows and reading the Superman and Batman comics as a little kid and loved them, but i wouldn't call myself a \"fan boy\" of comic universes, like so many younger people today. As an older adult I will admit my favorite TV show of all time was Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but watched it on DVD only after it had finished. I saw the second of the Dark Knight series in the theater, but the other two, I watched on DVD. They were great, but not my favorite films like so many people. i also loved the first couple Superman and Batman films in the older series. Regardless, i was not waiting with baited breath to see Man of Steel or this one.I'm more of a serious film fan, who can watch Stanley Kubrick films over and over and my favorite films in the last twenty years, are Eyes Wide Shut and Intersteller, both of which i've watched multiple times.So, with that said, take it from me, the critics have this film very wrong, just as critics hated 2001: A Space Odyssey when it first came out. This film will have lasting appreciation.Surprised how much I liked Ben Afleck's Batman. it was hard to get into Henry Cavil's scrawnier looking Superman, but it grew on me. Amy Adams was great as Lois Lane, The Gal Gadol Wonder Women was amazing. Lex Luther was terrific, like Nolan's Joker. Jeremy Irons was the best Alfred ever. Holly Hunter and Diane Lane was good too. The movie had bad reviews but made a billion dollars. Hopefully everyone buys the Ultimate Edition and it breaks sales records and the film is re-appreciated. I have no idea what scenes this Ultimate Edition added, but it is pretty perfect. Now I can't wait for Wonder Woman and the Justice League and as soon as I finish writing this am going to watch Man of Steal. I'm into it now!I can only surmise that the bad reviews stem from too much expectations of the rigid fan boy types and the radical changes in tone, we see in this film.Total masterpiece of cinema, but I have a few criticisms. There are a few hollow scenes of typical Idiot cops and authorities getting everything wrong in a cliché type way and it has a few filler scenes of that type and a few moments here and there that felt rushed and cheesy. Maybe not everything restored into the Ultimate Edition should have been. I wish there had been more Kevin Costner scenes."

"The whole entire Batman V Superman movie was great and yes even though it felt slow to the majority of the people who watched it but to me I enjoyed every part and every scene of Batman V Superman and when it got to the fight scenes both batman VS Superman and the Doomsday fight it brought so much drama, intensity, and epic performances. So with that being said I give this movie a good 10/10 because it really did go to my expectations and it brought a powerful performance and a powerful yet epic introduction to the upcoming Justice League."

"When I first wrote a review for this movie a year ago exclaiming my excitement for the film, I had been high off a fresh dose of live-action DC superheroes playing out the beloved comic book stories that I had grown up on. It was all playing out before my eyes and coming to life. After a few months had passed, I began to notice things about the movie that I disliked: little gaps in the story, things that didn't add up, etc. My original rating of a 10 / 10 dropped to an 8 /10. But today it has gone back up to a 10. The extended version of the film not only rectifies the gaps but also silences critics.Many claimed that the movie was too dark or that it just didn't make sense. To those people, I say: \"Pick up a comic book!\" Many of the critics of this particular film were part of the superhero bandwagon that formed when Marvel began its spree of Avengers-related films. In fact, its estimated that over 60% of people who go to see 'superhero' genre films have never picked up a comic book in their life. I would argue that similar numbers could figure to those which view the CW televised DC Universe shows. People complain that DC comics is just too dark but the fact is that these movies are based upon actual comics which are meant to be dark (ex: The Dark Knight Returns, Injustice, etc.). Its like complaining that Game of Thrones (the TV series) sucks because they kill off too many characters. Read the books! Its frustrating to see such a beautiful work of art like Batman V Superman criticized by those ignorant to its universe and its meaning. This movie is in fact a catalyst that opens numerous doorways and leaves true fans in awe of the possibilities for future movies. But regardless of whether or not people choose to educate themselves, this film's DVD/Blu-ray extended version puts the theater release to shame. All of the plot holes and gaps are filled in 30 minutes of extended footage scattered throughout the film. The movie ultimately becomes more complete and people will wish that the movie had shown the full 3 hours of footage in its theatrical debut. As a major DC comics fan, I will of course pick up on things that a comics fan would not, but someone who does not read comics would learn to appreciate this film in its entirety with the extended version. Get your hands on a copy today or find it on Netflix or the internet somewhere!"

"I ignored the bad reviews and watched anyways. This film had a lot to live up to after Civil War was released and I went into this film expecting the worst. It ended up to be the best Superhero film of 2016 to me. One complaint was that this film was more concerned about universe building than telling a great story than Civil War but for me it was the other way around; Civil War felt like a build up to something else and to be honest, I felt that way when I saw the other MCU films. Batman vs Superman however not only had a great story, but it also felt a lot more consistent than Civil War. This film was way more diverse with the cast than the MCU but unlike the MCU, I felt like this film doesn't go overboard with the SJW stuff like the MCU films or The Star Wars Sequel films do. The Visuals were AMAZING, The Score by Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL was AMAZING as well, The Tone is just right as I actually felt for the characters emotionally, The Cinematography kept my eyes glued to the screen, and the script felt really Intelligent and Complex and despite people calling the writing confusing, I was able to piece it together with no problem whatsoever. This film is similar to Empire Strikes back in terms of popularity so over time after the other movies are released, this movie would probably be more popular.This film was way better than I Expected and deserves another chance.

"Its shame to see what critics and marvel fans did to this movie and targeted Zack Snyder for it. I have seen this movie more than 25 times till date. And i enjoy this movie as much as i enjoyed the first time. The fans who have read DC comics, wouldn't be disappointed in this movie. Its dark movie, yes it is. Because the title shows the intense situation at hand. Two superheroes about to rip each other apart for whatever reasons that brought them to this stage. Yes it had to be dark and intense.Only marvel can be stupid enough to show an alien invasion where humans are loosing the battle and the super heroes are cracking jokes while battles as if they are playing ping pong. a person playing Call of Duty game is more serious while playing than the marvel heroes fighting aliens."

"Last week some news came out from somebody online who had claimed to have seen a finished version of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. If you were like me, you've been leery of checking it out because you weren't sure how much might actually be true. Now Zack Snyder has spoken out about the spoiler-filled post, although his response doesn't really clear anything up.In a word, to MTV, he called the post \"hilarious,which might imply that he's saying that it's mostly, if not entirely, untrue. That might be the case, but then again he could have just said it was untrue and he didn't say that. What he did say, however, is that he doesn't like spoilers. While this may seem odd for the director who's most recent trailer appeared to give away the entire movie, Snyder says that's not the case. Even if you've seen the trailer, you can rest easy, as there is much more we have not seen in then finished film. Says Snyder I have the benefit of seeing the movie. It's cool that think it's too much, and I appreciate people not wanting to know, but there's plenty that they don't know. There's a lot of movie that's not in the trailer. In the process of calling the Batman v Superman Reddit review hilarious, Snyder goes on to talk about how he hates it when spoilers come out. The director would much rather that fans see the movie mostly blind. While he understands that some fans may wish to find the answers before hand, he wants his movies to be mysteries going in. If you're, as an audience member, exploring these articles, looking for answers to questions that you have, maybe you're okay with knowing before you go. It's like an individual taste. But like I said, I want people to see the movie without knowing.Spoilers are a topic that mean different things to different people. While most try to avoid them to some degree, the need to solve the mystery is a nearly universal human experience. We have an inclination to want to know the truth, even while also wanting to be surprised. For most of us getting some information is good, but getting all the information is bad, of course, only getting the details that you want can be difficult."
"The theatrical is choppy, poorly edited, hard to follow, with some really good moments mixed in their. The extended is much more fluent and is much easier to follow, it does have a long runtime, which might make it seem a bit dragging on, but if you like long films done right, like Lord of the Rings, you will like this movie as long as you get into the characters and story. Speaking of which, the story starts out perfectly showing Bruce Wayne as a character, and it is very powerful. There are several moments in this movie that are powerful, emotional, and shocking. Characters. Batman is my favorite fictional character of all time, and believe me when I say, Ben Affleck as Batman was perfect, he had the charisma, the anger, and the look of being through some bad stuff Gal Gadot also does perfect as Wonder Woman, but if you want to really see how good she does, go watch the Wonder Woman movie. Henry Call as Superman. I really don't like it when people say Christopher Reeves is better. Don't get me wrong, Reeves does great, but can you imagine him as Superman in this movie? I wouldn't like it. It would be like Adam West playing Batman in The Dark Knight. Henry Cavill does great in this role, I can say everything about him as I said with Ben Affleck. Jesse Eisenberg as Luthor. I thought it was different in a good way. I've heard a criticism for him as being too much like Joker, but is that a bad thing? Joker is my favorite villain, so to see Superman have an enemy that crazy, but still hold the values Luthor needs to be Luthor, I think it is great. The thing I thought this movie was lacking in the first and second acts was humor, at least good humor. If there was more humor, I would've given this movie a ten because it would give a more relaxing feel to the parts that needed it. All in all though, this movie was awesome, it had powerful moments, it was badass, and just plain fun. It had a great story arc and does its job very well."

"*I will be talking about the Ultimate Edition of the film* This was one of the most anticipated CBM of all time. Ever since the arrival and subsequent success of Marvel's The Avengers people have wondered when will DC launch its own cinematic universe, one of the main reasons being the opportunity to finally see titans such as Batman and Superman share the screen together: the ultimate nerd dream. On 2016, the moment finally came for BvS to be released AND.. it performed poorly. Not only did critical reception left a lot to be desired, but fan reactions where surprisingly split after its cinematic debut. People either loved it and called Zack a genius, or hated it and called him a hack. Me, personally, I found myself with middle of the road feelings, for sure, but more leaning towards the negative side with subsequent viewings. The theatrical cut of the film showcased amazing performances, incredible visuals, and action set pieces that seemed like comic book panels come to life, in a good way. However, when it comes to its narrative structure and more technical aspects like editing, the film was seriously flawed. More plot holes than Age of Ultron, questionable character decisions, random editing that lacked cohesion and focus, and forced dramatic moments that lacked any impact because the attempts at character development ranged from limited to nonexistent, especially when it comes to Superman's character. I thought it was a 5/10 movie at best. As such, I was kind of skeptical about the idea of a 30 minute longer version. I say kind of because I know how Zack works. I remember Watchmen being vastly improved with its director's cut, so in a way I was expecting BvS to perform in a similar manner, but I also feared those 30 minutes wold be just there to amplify action and discredit storytelling issues. Oh boy, I'm so glad I was proved wrong. The ultimate cut of the film was infuriating, but not because it was awful, but because it questions the sanity of WB executives and editors and makes you wonder what were they thinking during the editing process. What I got out of the Ultimate Edition was a thought-provoking deconstruction of two very iconic superheroes that gave spotlight to the struggles both of them face when they aren't fighting crime. What I got was an extremely well produced character study on both Batman and Superman in a cynical world, a world dangerously close to our own. We meet Batman as a ruthless, worn out hero that has seen the failure behind his ideals and witnessed some truly horrifying things in his life. Superman, on the other hand, is portrayed as a godlike figure that seeks to do good in the world, but finds himself emotionally conflicted once he realized that every good deed he does leaves behind a trail of destruction (most of it due to Luthor's antics). In my opinion, this is a hugely original approach, one that distances itself from the rest of the competition and delivers a dark, somber, yet relevant superhero movie that understands both characters and gives them real human struggles to deal with. I felt invested in both of them, and hoped that by the end of the film both could find a way to redeem themselves. Their character arcs were very well established during the first two acts of the movie, and by the time we get to the titular climactic battle the emotion behind the jaw-dropping action is intensified. Lex Luthor as a villain was also given more time to develop with this new edition. One of the main criticisms with the original version was the fact that his plan relied too much on conveniences, and the character's mannerisms and mad-scientist attitude was annoying, and that goes without saying his motivations were unclear. Not only do we spend more time understanding his hate for any godlike figure and thus his hatred for Superman, but the added scenes allowed us to witness his entire plan come to fruition. It sells the cold, manipulative, calculating attributes of his comic counterpart. The acting is spot on. Every actor owns his/her role, from Cavill's Superman, to Ben Affleck as Batman, Eisenberg as Luthor, and Gadot as Wonder Woman, whose scenes are brief, but are more than enough to sell the strong and ferocious warrior that she is. Cinematography is stunning, and miles above that of Man of Steel's. And the soundtrack by Zimmer and Junkie XL? Perfect, just perfect. When it comes to flaws, the film still has some of those. The Martha moment, while serving as a pivotal character moment for Batman, felt off in execution, and its understandable that many people got mad at it. If your main complaint about BvS the first time around was its bleak tone and subject matter, this film is still not for you. I understand most were expecting to see the heroes being the most iconic versions of themselves, clashing in an elongated battle and evoking the same feelings The Avengers gave audiences back in 2012. In that sense, the film will remain divisive, but at least I have the comfort of saying that, at the very least, the film is competently made."

"This film was amazing. Ben Affleck was easily the best part of this movie, he brought his a-game as Batman. The chemistry between Affleck & Irons was outstanding. Gal Gadot did a great job as Wonder Woman. The fight between Batman & Superman was awesome. The final fight with Doomsday was outstanding in every way possible. However, there is only one problem with this film and that's Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor. He was sadly missed cast in this role, but then again it's really the fault of Warner Bros. Studios. Overall, this film deliver on almost every level. I highly recommend that you watch the extended version of this film."

"I know I know. I saw it in theaters too, and felt like it could've been so much better. While the Batman element was good, the narrative felt fractured, and the third act was just one long stunt scene. Superman was relegated to a supporting character, and other characters didn't get a chance to shine. And then I chanced on the ultimate cut. Calling it 30 mins of \"extra\" footage is unfair to Zack Snyder because it's exactly these 30 mins that makes the movie a worthy one. What I can say about the theatrical cut is this - It had the blockbuster elements - music, visuals, stunts, CGI. But, it lacked the human elements. The first 20 mins of the movie had it, but not after that. The extended cut in comparison has a flow to the narrative. There are no disjointed scenes, everything flows smoothly, and there's connective tissue. Superman gets to spend some time with his father, and mother. Clark Kent does some investigative journalism. Superman helps the people after the blast. Lois Lane doesn't jump to conclusions, she gets to the bottom of the crime. Lex Luthor apparently had a coherent plan - everything is explained pretty well. Wonder Woman was already good, so there's no change there :) Also, the \"Martha\" scene seems better executed, because it is a few seconds longer, and there's time to breathe it in. So, here's my take on this movie - The theatrical cut was junk. Get the Bluray for ultimate edition, and you shall not be disappointed. I've seen it so many more times now, and it's the definitive cut. It is the movie we deserve. It's a unique take on Batman, and Superman. It's a gritty take on the superhero movie genre, and definitely the best DCEU movie, and the best DC movie since The Dark Knight.P.S. Yes it's dark. We're adults, and we should appreciate mature film making without intentionally silly moments. It attempts to be philosophical, and something deep instead of just trying to make you chuckle."

"This is one of the best superhero movies ever made. Zack Snyder is a magician behind the camera.The reason behind so many complaints is the fact that Warner Bros. marketed this movie as a fight between Batman and Superman. That's not what it is. It's a movie about the origins of the Justice League.The cinematography, the acting and the score are all second to none. This film is phenomenal.P.S: watch the 3 hour extended cut that Snyder intended you to see, not the 2 and a half hour movie that Warner Bros. decided would be better for theaters."

"I don't care what the critics say, this is a very well-done movie. I'll start my review by listing what I like about the movie.1.) Ben Affleck is the best batman to me and it is not close. He pulls off the role of an aging batman extremely well. Also, Zack Snyder's vision of batman is legit. I have always hated batman up until this adaptation of him. Instead of being a conflicted and idealistic batman, this batman is dark, gritty, and 100% a badass. His equipment is decked out with machine guns and he has no aversion to killing people. In fact, he probably kills about 50 criminal by the time this movie is over. The warehouse scene is the coolest batman scene in any movie.2.) The development of a grudge between batman and superman is pulled off flawlessly. It actually makes sense why batman dislikes superman. Then, when they do fight it is about the coolest thing you can expect to see from a superhero film. 3.) I disagree with a lot of people about Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor. In my opinion, he played his role to perfection. 4.) B v S sets up Wonder Woman and Justice League with Gal Gadot's cameo as Wonder Woman and short clips of Aquaman, the Flash, and Cyborg. B v S is one of my favorite superhero films and rewatching it never gets old."

"The theatrical cut of this film is garbage which is why I rated it eight stars instead of nine. The first time I watched this film I didn't like it (not straight out hate but didn't like). Character motivations didn't make any sense, Lex was annoying as s***, editing was sloppy, and it was overly dark and broody for an action superhero movie. A year + a half, five Marvel films, a ton of bad reviews and a Justice League later a thought popped into my head: \"what if I watched BVS again\". This time I didn't have trailers ruining the best moments, I only vaguely remembered the film, and I was conditioned to look at it negatively but something unexpected happened: I actually loved it. Superman was just a normal person that tried to make a difference cause he could that others imposed their own beliefs on. Lex Luthor was a genius that couldn't stand his powerlessness compared to Superman or more accurately a super being. As Alfred said \"The fever, the rage, the feeling of powerlessness that turns good men... cruel\" and you see the same thought process in Batman. Batman, just like Lex Luthor feels powerless in the midst of a god-being and just like Lex he attempts to destroy him so he can get his sense of power back but unlike Lex, Batman learns something. I what is one of the corniest lines of the movie Superman says, \"Martha\" when he knows he can't win against Batman in a late desperate attempt to save his mother. Not only does this name connect with Bruce Wayne but it also shows what really matters to a man of steel: it isn't power, it isn't fame or anything else, it is his Mother and on a broader scale it is people. Lex (who doesn't care about people at all) knows he doesn't have the power so he creates something from his blood and the remains of Zod: A Doomsday for Superman. Not only does this film have depth but it also doesn't always explain it to you which is rare in a blockbuster action superhero flick normally cater to semi-comic book fans and people that want to shove popcorn in their mouths. This film rewards you for really noticing the details while still having massive explosions. One of my favorites is how Lex has all of Batman's branded killed which is why he isn't afraid of the branding at the end or Grandma's Peach Tea as a way of scaring the s*** out of someone. Of course, this film isn't perfect and I do have personal dislikes. The Batman V Superman fight was slow and pretty boring especially after watching such an amazing fight in Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 2 (If you haven't watched the animated Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 1 and 2 you are sorely missing out on something fantastic). Also, the addition of Wonder Woman who pretty much steals a hacker thing, gives it back and then suits up and fights against a giant monster thing. Not to say I don't like Wonder Woman (She is one of my favorite Superheroes of all time who showed not only can woman kick a** but they also don't need to be ashamed of their sexuality or gender) but she wasn't really that helpful to the plot and just brought in to expand the universe which was well done through Lex's superhuman hunting files. Also, the post-apocalyptic scene that was just a dream could have been cut but nothing is perfect except movies like Citizen Kane which isn't a lot of fun to watch cause it is too perfect. So to summarize, the theatrical cut is bad, the ultimate cut is Amazing and the other cut is meh. Please give it a second chance because it deserves it and save a good director from losing grace because of something he didn't do."
"I really liked it, don't know what all the hate is about. I'm actually a Marvel fan from when I was 7 or so, but Superman and Batman together in 1 movie? Just great. And personally I like Ben Affleck even better than Christian Bale as Batman. So just watch and enjoy, I know I did!"

"That's right. We have been waiting for these two heroes to finally meet and fight against each other. This movie is so good in both plot and special effects.Henry Cavill and Ben Affleck have performed well in their acting stages. They are the best superhero actors and they have filmed their fighting scenes very well. The movie starts to show the conflict between the lives of the heroes and now they have blamed each other for it. This movie is amazing and sets up a good plot for Dawn Justice."

"Actually...I didn't know what to expect. When you see Wonder Woman, you know it will be off of Wonder Woman and off of a Wonder Woman story, but with Batman V Superman, I was like, \"hmmmm, so who is this about?\" It was pretty obvious that it would feature many characters, but I thought the introduction to Batman was amazing. Ben Affleck nailed the part, not only as Batman but also as Bruce Wayne. He is my Batman. Henry Cavill continued to be super as the Man of Steel. And he is my Super - Man. A dark story? Yes, without a doubt. Could it have had a few more jokes? Sure. But not all movies or stories need to have jokes when certain events are serious. I really hope people can see this review and take another look at the movie, because, I loved it. I really hope the ratings can go up, eventually. And P.S, this movie is the perfect set up to Justice League."

"I'll start by making it clear I have only ever seen the Ultimate Edition. I'm aware of what was cut out for the theatrical release, so I will concede up front that most of the criticisms about pacing, editing, and missing bits of plot at release were merited.With that caveat out of the way, I must reiterate that this was bar-none the boldest superhero movie I have ever seen. To me, it was arguably the best as well, though \"best\" shouldn't be taken to mean \"most enjoyable.\" That honor easily goes to \"Thor: Ragnarok.\" What makes BvS stand out among other films in the genre is that it takes two characters who have been done to death since the 1970s and brings them up to date. I recently tried to watch \"Superman: The Movie\" for the first time in a number of years, and while it was still good and Reeves will always be iconic, I just couldn't take it seriously. I'll put it this way: If the story in BvS was \"stupid\" in your view but Superman turning back time by spinning the earth backward on its axis didn't seem like one of the dumbest things you have ever seen -in any movie from any genre- to the extent that it outright ruins the movie for you, then your opinion about BvS isn't worth much. Nostalgic bias was always going to be a problem for this movie, and the way people reacted to and reviewed \"Man of Steel\" was telling in this regard.That brings me to Zack Snyder's take on Superman. You know, that guy whose status as the first extraterrestrial ever encountered by humanity was a total non-issue in the old movies. Apparently, Snyder has a similar view to my own in that his take on the Man of Steel makes his being an alien a core piece of his identity. He may look like any other (absurdly attractive) person, but he knows what he is, and that makes him perpetually uncertain of where he fits in this world. He is essentially good and really does care about people, but he struggles to truly empathize with the likes of us. To be human is to be frail, and that is not something he can easily relate to. This is the root of his conflict with Batman.Just as Clark struggles to genuinely relate to most people, Snyder's Batman either refuses to or otherwise just can't relate to Superman. He doesn't see him as anything but a threat regardless of Superman's clear good intentions. Remember, a small group of Kryptonians were able to bring humanity to the brink of extinction in less than a day, and Bruce Wayne is nothing if not a realist. He didn't know the guy from Kansas. He only knew the god from another world.While Batman's anger toward and fear of Superman are readily apparent from the start, Superman's inability to imagine things from Bruce Wayne's perspective only becomes truly apparent during their first real interaction. This reminded me of the animated version of the \"world's finest\" storyline, where Superman judges Batman harshly for using fear tactics and threats of violence (also, actual violence) to get the job done. Superman wasn't willing to consider what it would take for a human man to fight criminals and save innocents, or what that life would do to him over time. Just as Batman didn't see the guy from Kansas, Superman didn't see the man who lives his life trapped in one brutal, unthinkably traumatic moment (this was beautifully conveyed during the film's opening moments), and had spent his whole adult life bearing witness to humanity at its absolute worst.The conflict between these two characters is as old as human history. They want the same things, but they can't understand one another. So they fight. And what a fight it was.Watching a fight between, say, Captain America and Iron Man was, to me, more frustrating than anything because each understood the other's perspective perfectly. The fight between Batman and Superman in BvS was genuinely gut-wrenching, as intended, because they would have understood one another if either had tried. The whole sequence hilighted Batman's tactical prowess and ability to control a situation. Maybe the most badass thing about the fight was that it ended exactly where Batman planned. That brings me to the big elephant in the room named \"Martha.\"I can't recall exactly which YouTuber put it this way, but if you thought the \"save Martha\" exchange was about their mothers having the same name, you had your brain turned off. The brain-on people have explained this to death, but it bears repeating. This was the moment when Superman became humanized to Batman. He was about to die, and his only concern was for his adoptive human mother. He still believed that the man about to take his life would do the right thing. Even with the cowl on, there was no mistaking the look on Batman's face. It was the look of shame, guilt, and sudden uncertainty that says \"What am I doing?\" Turns out even the most brutal, angry version of Bruce Wayne is better than Tony Stark at knowing right from wrong. At knowing that he had gone too far.From there, the third act was a series of truly impressive (albeit mostly CGI) fight sequences, beginning with what I regard as the undisputed champion of Batman fights. Nothing in the Nolan movies (and especially nothing in the Burton movies) even came close. Go ahead, try to convince yourself that Batman and Bane taking turns punching one another in the face until Bane's mask broke was a good fight sequence. No, this was a fight straight out of \"Arkham Knight,\" and it was glorious. The battle against Doomsday really was one for the books. From the moment Wonder Woman arrived accompanied by the intense sounds of Tina Guo's electric cello to Superman's tragic, heroic death at the hands of Doomsday, I was glued to the screen. Sure, the mere presence of Doomsday spoiled the end to a degree, but watching the Man of Steel laboring to carry that kryptonite spear towards certain death was no less impactful. A brief word on Jesse Eisenberg's take on Lex Luthor. At least one other reviewer on this site already said it best when they pointed out that this was his origin story. If you consider his scheme objectively, he is actually one of the more formidable incarnations of the character. If we're lucky, we'll eventually get to see a Snyder Cut of \"Justice League\" and find out where this story was actually meant to go. For the record, Joss Whedon and Danny Elfman both should have said \"no\" to taking a dump on someone else's art."
"BATMAN V SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE brings a fantastic surprise to a smash-hit team-up with one of the worlds most beloved DC Comics' icons of all time. The movie delivers spectacular casting, and fantastic acting with different characters having their shine in each scenes.The story follows Clark Kent/Superman who becomes a threat, after the destruction in Metropolis in Man Of Steel.(2013). Batman/Bruce Wayne sees him as a threat and begins his war on Superman.The movie brings spectacular storytelling, it tells the complications of human against alien who are on the same side, and the first meeting of Batman and Superman. The story of Bruce Wayne, with his many years of The Caped Crusader, sends him on a spiral of \"out of control\", sheer anger, and builds tension to wanting to defeat the Man of Steel. Snyder has fantastically gave this storytelling an exciting nod to the comics.Lex Luthor, played by Jesse Einsberg, delivers a very interesting performance, but very differently by him showing is his \"origin\" before he becomes a bald foe to the Man of Steel. He shows that his love of \"god vs man\" terrorises mankind when he ultimately creates Doomsday, and Batman realises Superman's inner heroism.It packs so many great \"out of nowhere\" excitement, including a first-look of the fearful Wonder Woman a.k.a. Diana Prince, played by Gal Gadot, and a fresh-new glimpse of the superhero DC canon: The Justice League.WATCH THIS MOVIE! The critics are out of their mind. It's a fun-packed action adventure which still keeps the movie enjoyable until it's final minutes of the movie. It's a FANTASTIC MOVIE! BEN AFFLECK AS BATMAN... is Incredible!A 10/10 overall!"
"I want to go on record as saying that this is a truly thrilling cinematic experience in so many ways. If pressed, I guess I could acknowledge that there were a couple ... let's say \"clumsy\" moments. And in a film that runs to three hours, that hardly seems like a significant issue, certainly not enough to rate it with fewer than 9 stars.This film has everything. There is dramatic tension right from the start. There is a magnificent story arc that picks up quite seamlessly from 'Man of Steel' and propels the viewer not only into the life of Clark Kent/Superman but also of Bruce Wayne/Batman.The villain is no mere cartoon of a villain; he is truly thoroughly (and apparently irrevocably) diabolical. He is a psychopath, and you wish for his death over and over and over. You want Superman to reduce him to ash with the power of his eyes.I have read a number of viewers' reviews, and it seems that the people who disliked the film / gave it a low rating had rather unfair and unrealistic expectations of it. That is, their own prejudices about how the plot could/should unfold or what the character development could/should be, etc. ruined the film for them. And that is a shame.My thought is: I settle into my seat, wait for the lights to dim, and then I wait to be transported by the film. I accept it, lock, stock, and barrel.As another reviewer remarked, I love how the film begins from the point of view of Bruce Wayne as he is among people on the ground who have fallen victim to the attack of Zod and the other Kryptonians.Why would Bruce Wayne not like Superman? Why would the good people of Earth hurl insults at Superman and burn him in effigy (on the news)? Because the good people of Earth just got catapulted into a new reality in which there are not only extraterrestrial beings (surprise!) but they are also superman! And a group of them are hell-bent on destroying humankind and taking the planet for themselves.It is difficult to see Superman as separate from the whole Kryptonian Krew.It seems that many moviegoers forgot that Bruce Wayne is also human. Sure, he's a hero, but he is flawed.. Just like the rest of us. He is a vigilante, after all.He has let his vigilantism get the better of him. HE is actually the one working outside the boundaries of the law, not Superman. It is the clear head of Alfred that shows us that he has gone into a rather dark place, that he has not seen what is really going on (in Luthor's scheme), and so he chooses to embark on his own scheme scheme to take out the alien invader. He is (allegedly) thinking of the future: if he wipes out the all-powerful alien, then it can't turn on humankind in the future. At least, he convinces himself of that.A philosophical question is raised in the film: should Clark Kent have remained a simple man from Kansas and never have become the Superman? Should he just let people die and let calamities happen? The question is answered for us in the character of Diana Prince/Wonder Woman. She withdrew from mankind (her exact words) and just sat around watching. Watching while people died horrible deaths all around her. So, should Superman have done the same? Do these special beings, these 'metahumans', have some kind of moral imperative to intervene, or should they be allowed to be regular people, too? It seems that humans want it both ways.It seems that humans are saying: \"Don't be a superalien ... except when I and my friends and family are in trouble. Then come save us.\""

"Batman v Superman: Ultimate Edition: If your looking for a quick, cheap thrill then you might not enjoy this film at the time. This movies theatrical version was butchered by WB and in doing so reshaped the story leaving numerous plot holes. So the Ultimate Edition is the full story and the one worth seeing. Watch 'Man of Steel' before seeing this movie. There is much to claw through here, so much so that the audience might easily find themselves exhausted from the overall aggression of the film. However, a lot of the story does work. The action is good, and the emotion feels real most of the time.This film is about Superman trying to become Superman. Trying to help the world, save people, find a place in this world not as an outcast, and yet is looked at has a threat by many. Superman is not from this world, yet He is trying to be human, find a place in this world, be excepted by earths people, and come into his destiny.This film is also about Batman being Batman for 20 years and losing faith in humanity, and fearing Superman, what Superman can do with his powers. Great film, great plot, great visuals. ---Yidioo"
"I didn't see the film in the theaters and just bought the \"Extended Edition \" on Amazon. I never properly saw Man of Steel- i think I rented it and watched it when already exhausted and fell asleep. I saw the mediocre user reviews and horrible reviews from critics of this film.They really have it wrong. This is the very best either Batman or Superman. It has a different take, on things. Much darker then earlier films even darker then the Christopher Nolan Batman films.First of all Christopher Nolan is an Executive Producer. So how bad could it be? I loved Sucker Punch and Zack Snyder was involved with that. So how bad could this be? Hans Zimmer did the music, so how bad could it be?I remember watching the old Superman TV shows and reading the Superman and Batman comics as a little kid and loved them, but i wouldn't call myself a \"fan boy\" of comic universes, like so many younger people today. As an older adult I will admit my favorite TV show of all time was Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but watched it on DVD only after it had finished. I saw the second of the Dark Knight series in the theater, but the other two, I watched on DVD. They were great, but not my favorite films like so many people. i also loved the first couple Superman and Batman films in the older series. Regardless, i was not waiting with baited breath to see Man of Steel or this one.I'm more of a serious film fan, who can watch Stanley Kubrick films over and over and my favorite films in the last twenty years, are Eyes Wide Shut and Intersteller, both of which i've watched multiple times.So, with that said, take it from me, the critics have this film very wrong, just as critics hated 2001: A Space Odyssey when it first came out. This film will have lasting appreciation.Surprised how much I liked Ben Afleck's Batman. it was hard to get into Henry Cavil's scrawnier looking Superman, but it grew on me. Amy Adams was great as Lois Lane, The Gal Gadol Wonder Women was amazing. Lex Luther was terrific, like Nolan's Joker. Jeremy Irons was the best Alfred ever. Holly Hunter and Diane Lane was good too. The movie had bad reviews but made a billion dollars. Hopefully everyone buys the Ultimate Edition and it breaks sales records and the film is re-appreciated. I have no idea what scenes this Ultimate Edition added, but it is pretty perfect. Now I can't wait for Wonder Woman and the Justice League and as soon as I finish writing this am going to watch Man of Steal. I'm into it now!I can only surmise that the bad reviews stem from too much expectations of the rigid fan boy types and the radical changes in tone, we see in this film.Total masterpiece of cinema, but I have a few criticisms. There are a few hollow scenes of typical Idiot cops and authorities getting everything wrong in a cliché type way and it has a few filler scenes of that type and a few moments here and there that felt rushed and cheesy. Maybe not everything restored into the Ultimate Edition should have been. I wish there had been more Kevin Costner scenes."

"The whole entire Batman V Superman movie was great and yes even though it felt slow to the majority of the people who watched it but to me I enjoyed every part and every scene of Batman V Superman and when it got to the fight scenes both batman VS Superman and the Doomsday fight it brought so much drama, intensity, and epic performances. So with that being said I give this movie a good 10/10 because it really did go to my expectations and it brought a powerful performance and a powerful yet epic introduction to the upcoming Justice League."

"When I first wrote a review for this movie a year ago exclaiming my excitement for the film, I had been high off a fresh dose of live-action DC superheroes playing out the beloved comic book stories that I had grown up on. It was all playing out before my eyes and coming to life. After a few months had passed, I began to notice things about the movie that I disliked: little gaps in the story, things that didn't add up, etc. My original rating of a 10 / 10 dropped to an 8 /10. But today it has gone back up to a 10. The extended version of the film not only rectifies the gaps but also silences critics.Many claimed that the movie was too dark or that it just didn't make sense. To those people, I say: \"Pick up a comic book!\" Many of the critics of this particular film were part of the superhero bandwagon that formed when Marvel began its spree of Avengers-related films. In fact, its estimated that over 60% of people who go to see 'superhero' genre films have never picked up a comic book in their life. I would argue that similar numbers could figure to those which view the CW televised DC Universe shows. People complain that DC comics is just too dark but the fact is that these movies are based upon actual comics which are meant to be dark (ex: The Dark Knight Returns, Injustice, etc.). Its like complaining that Game of Thrones (the TV series) sucks because they kill off too many characters. Read the books! Its frustrating to see such a beautiful work of art like Batman V Superman criticized by those ignorant to its universe and its meaning. This movie is in fact a catalyst that opens numerous doorways and leaves true fans in awe of the possibilities for future movies. But regardless of whether or not people choose to educate themselves, this film's DVD/Blu-ray extended version puts the theater release to shame. All of the plot holes and gaps are filled in 30 minutes of extended footage scattered throughout the film. The movie ultimately becomes more complete and people will wish that the movie had shown the full 3 hours of footage in its theatrical debut. As a major DC comics fan, I will of course pick up on things that a comics fan would not, but someone who does not read comics would learn to appreciate this film in its entirety with the extended version. Get your hands on a copy today or find it on Netflix or the internet somewhere!"

"I ignored the bad reviews and watched anyways. This film had a lot to live up to after Civil War was released and I went into this film expecting the worst. It ended up to be the best Superhero film of 2016 to me. One complaint was that this film was more concerned about universe building than telling a great story than Civil War but for me it was the other way around; Civil War felt like a build up to something else and to be honest, I felt that way when I saw the other MCU films. Batman vs Superman however not only had a great story, but it also felt a lot more consistent than Civil War. This film was way more diverse with the cast than the MCU but unlike the MCU, I felt like this film doesn't go overboard with the SJW stuff like the MCU films or The Star Wars Sequel films do. The Visuals were AMAZING, The Score by Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL was AMAZING as well, The Tone is just right as I actually felt for the characters emotionally, The Cinematography kept my eyes glued to the screen, and the script felt really Intelligent and Complex and despite people calling the writing confusing, I was able to piece it together with no problem whatsoever. This film is similar to Empire Strikes back in terms of popularity so over time after the other movies are released, this movie would probably be more popular.This film was way better than I Expected and deserves another chance.

"Its shame to see what critics and marvel fans did to this movie and targeted Zack Snyder for it. I have seen this movie more than 25 times till date. And i enjoy this movie as much as i enjoyed the first time. The fans who have read DC comics, wouldn't be disappointed in this movie. Its dark movie, yes it is. Because the title shows the intense situation at hand. Two superheroes about to rip each other apart for whatever reasons that brought them to this stage. Yes it had to be dark and intense.Only marvel can be stupid enough to show an alien invasion where humans are loosing the battle and the super heroes are cracking jokes while battles as if they are playing ping pong. a person playing Call of Duty game is more serious while playing than the marvel heroes fighting aliens."

"Last week some news came out from somebody online who had claimed to have seen a finished version of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. If you were like me, you've been leery of checking it out because you weren't sure how much might actually be true. Now Zack Snyder has spoken out about the spoiler-filled post, although his response doesn't really clear anything up.In a word, to MTV, he called the post \"hilarious,which might imply that he's saying that it's mostly, if not entirely, untrue. That might be the case, but then again he could have just said it was untrue and he didn't say that. What he did say, however, is that he doesn't like spoilers. While this may seem odd for the director who's most recent trailer appeared to give away the entire movie, Snyder says that's not the case. Even if you've seen the trailer, you can rest easy, as there is much more we have not seen in then finished film. Says Snyder I have the benefit of seeing the movie. It's cool that think it's too much, and I appreciate people not wanting to know, but there's plenty that they don't know. There's a lot of movie that's not in the trailer. In the process of calling the Batman v Superman Reddit review hilarious, Snyder goes on to talk about how he hates it when spoilers come out. The director would much rather that fans see the movie mostly blind. While he understands that some fans may wish to find the answers before hand, he wants his movies to be mysteries going in. If you're, as an audience member, exploring these articles, looking for answers to questions that you have, maybe you're okay with knowing before you go. It's like an individual taste. But like I said, I want people to see the movie without knowing.Spoilers are a topic that mean different things to different people. While most try to avoid them to some degree, the need to solve the mystery is a nearly universal human experience. We have an inclination to want to know the truth, even while also wanting to be surprised. For most of us getting some information is good, but getting all the information is bad, of course, only getting the details that you want can be difficult."
"The theatrical is choppy, poorly edited, hard to follow, with some really good moments mixed in their. The extended is much more fluent and is much easier to follow, it does have a long runtime, which might make it seem a bit dragging on, but if you like long films done right, like Lord of the Rings, you will like this movie as long as you get into the characters and story. Speaking of which, the story starts out perfectly showing Bruce Wayne as a character, and it is very powerful. There are several moments in this movie that are powerful, emotional, and shocking. Characters. Batman is my favorite fictional character of all time, and believe me when I say, Ben Affleck as Batman was perfect, he had the charisma, the anger, and the look of being through some bad stuff Gal Gadot also does perfect as Wonder Woman, but if you want to really see how good she does, go watch the Wonder Woman movie. Henry Call as Superman. I really don't like it when people say Christopher Reeves is better. Don't get me wrong, Reeves does great, but can you imagine him as Superman in this movie? I wouldn't like it. It would be like Adam West playing Batman in The Dark Knight. Henry Cavill does great in this role, I can say everything about him as I said with Ben Affleck. Jesse Eisenberg as Luthor. I thought it was different in a good way. I've heard a criticism for him as being too much like Joker, but is that a bad thing? Joker is my favorite villain, so to see Superman have an enemy that crazy, but still hold the values Luthor needs to be Luthor, I think it is great. The thing I thought this movie was lacking in the first and second acts was humor, at least good humor. If there was more humor, I would've given this movie a ten because it would give a more relaxing feel to the parts that needed it. All in all though, this movie was awesome, it had powerful moments, it was badass, and just plain fun. It had a great story arc and does its job very well."

"*I will be talking about the Ultimate Edition of the film* This was one of the most anticipated CBM of all time. Ever since the arrival and subsequent success of Marvel's The Avengers people have wondered when will DC launch its own cinematic universe, one of the main reasons being the opportunity to finally see titans such as Batman and Superman share the screen together: the ultimate nerd dream. On 2016, the moment finally came for BvS to be released AND.. it performed poorly. Not only did critical reception left a lot to be desired, but fan reactions where surprisingly split after its cinematic debut. People either loved it and called Zack a genius, or hated it and called him a hack. Me, personally, I found myself with middle of the road feelings, for sure, but more leaning towards the negative side with subsequent viewings. The theatrical cut of the film showcased amazing performances, incredible visuals, and action set pieces that seemed like comic book panels come to life, in a good way. However, when it comes to its narrative structure and more technical aspects like editing, the film was seriously flawed. More plot holes than Age of Ultron, questionable character decisions, random editing that lacked cohesion and focus, and forced dramatic moments that lacked any impact because the attempts at character development ranged from limited to nonexistent, especially when it comes to Superman's character. I thought it was a 5/10 movie at best. As such, I was kind of skeptical about the idea of a 30 minute longer version. I say kind of because I know how Zack works. I remember Watchmen being vastly improved with its director's cut, so in a way I was expecting BvS to perform in a similar manner, but I also feared those 30 minutes wold be just there to amplify action and discredit storytelling issues. Oh boy, I'm so glad I was proved wrong. The ultimate cut of the film was infuriating, but not because it was awful, but because it questions the sanity of WB executives and editors and makes you wonder what were they thinking during the editing process. What I got out of the Ultimate Edition was a thought-provoking deconstruction of two very iconic superheroes that gave spotlight to the struggles both of them face when they aren't fighting crime. What I got was an extremely well produced character study on both Batman and Superman in a cynical world, a world dangerously close to our own. We meet Batman as a ruthless, worn out hero that has seen the failure behind his ideals and witnessed some truly horrifying things in his life. Superman, on the other hand, is portrayed as a godlike figure that seeks to do good in the world, but finds himself emotionally conflicted once he realized that every good deed he does leaves behind a trail of destruction (most of it due to Luthor's antics). In my opinion, this is a hugely original approach, one that distances itself from the rest of the competition and delivers a dark, somber, yet relevant superhero movie that understands both characters and gives them real human struggles to deal with. I felt invested in both of them, and hoped that by the end of the film both could find a way to redeem themselves. Their character arcs were very well established during the first two acts of the movie, and by the time we get to the titular climactic battle the emotion behind the jaw-dropping action is intensified. Lex Luthor as a villain was also given more time to develop with this new edition. One of the main criticisms with the original version was the fact that his plan relied too much on conveniences, and the character's mannerisms and mad-scientist attitude was annoying, and that goes without saying his motivations were unclear. Not only do we spend more time understanding his hate for any godlike figure and thus his hatred for Superman, but the added scenes allowed us to witness his entire plan come to fruition. It sells the cold, manipulative, calculating attributes of his comic counterpart. The acting is spot on. Every actor owns his/her role, from Cavill's Superman, to Ben Affleck as Batman, Eisenberg as Luthor, and Gadot as Wonder Woman, whose scenes are brief, but are more than enough to sell the strong and ferocious warrior that she is. Cinematography is stunning, and miles above that of Man of Steel's. And the soundtrack by Zimmer and Junkie XL? Perfect, just perfect. When it comes to flaws, the film still has some of those. The Martha moment, while serving as a pivotal character moment for Batman, felt off in execution, and its understandable that many people got mad at it. If your main complaint about BvS the first time around was its bleak tone and subject matter, this film is still not for you. I understand most were expecting to see the heroes being the most iconic versions of themselves, clashing in an elongated battle and evoking the same feelings The Avengers gave audiences back in 2012. In that sense, the film will remain divisive, but at least I have the comfort of saying that, at the very least, the film is competently made."

"This film was amazing. Ben Affleck was easily the best part of this movie, he brought his a-game as Batman. The chemistry between Affleck & Irons was outstanding. Gal Gadot did a great job as Wonder Woman. The fight between Batman & Superman was awesome. The final fight with Doomsday was outstanding in every way possible. However, there is only one problem with this film and that's Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor. He was sadly missed cast in this role, but then again it's really the fault of Warner Bros. Studios. Overall, this film deliver on almost every level. I highly recommend that you watch the extended version of this film."

"I know I know. I saw it in theaters too, and felt like it could've been so much better. While the Batman element was good, the narrative felt fractured, and the third act was just one long stunt scene. Superman was relegated to a supporting character, and other characters didn't get a chance to shine. And then I chanced on the ultimate cut. Calling it 30 mins of \"extra\" footage is unfair to Zack Snyder because it's exactly these 30 mins that makes the movie a worthy one. What I can say about the theatrical cut is this - It had the blockbuster elements - music, visuals, stunts, CGI. But, it lacked the human elements. The first 20 mins of the movie had it, but not after that. The extended cut in comparison has a flow to the narrative. There are no disjointed scenes, everything flows smoothly, and there's connective tissue. Superman gets to spend some time with his father, and mother. Clark Kent does some investigative journalism. Superman helps the people after the blast. Lois Lane doesn't jump to conclusions, she gets to the bottom of the crime. Lex Luthor apparently had a coherent plan - everything is explained pretty well. Wonder Woman was already good, so there's no change there :) Also, the \"Martha\" scene seems better executed, because it is a few seconds longer, and there's time to breathe it in. So, here's my take on this movie - The theatrical cut was junk. Get the Bluray for ultimate edition, and you shall not be disappointed. I've seen it so many more times now, and it's the definitive cut. It is the movie we deserve. It's a unique take on Batman, and Superman. It's a gritty take on the superhero movie genre, and definitely the best DCEU movie, and the best DC movie since The Dark Knight.P.S. Yes it's dark. We're adults, and we should appreciate mature film making without intentionally silly moments. It attempts to be philosophical, and something deep instead of just trying to make you chuckle."

"This is one of the best superhero movies ever made. Zack Snyder is a magician behind the camera.The reason behind so many complaints is the fact that Warner Bros. marketed this movie as a fight between Batman and Superman. That's not what it is. It's a movie about the origins of the Justice League.The cinematography, the acting and the score are all second to none. This film is phenomenal.P.S: watch the 3 hour extended cut that Snyder intended you to see, not the 2 and a half hour movie that Warner Bros. decided would be better for theaters."

"I don't care what the critics say, this is a very well-done movie. I'll start my review by listing what I like about the movie.1.) Ben Affleck is the best batman to me and it is not close. He pulls off the role of an aging batman extremely well. Also, Zack Snyder's vision of batman is legit. I have always hated batman up until this adaptation of him. Instead of being a conflicted and idealistic batman, this batman is dark, gritty, and 100% a badass. His equipment is decked out with machine guns and he has no aversion to killing people. In fact, he probably kills about 50 criminal by the time this movie is over. The warehouse scene is the coolest batman scene in any movie.2.) The development of a grudge between batman and superman is pulled off flawlessly. It actually makes sense why batman dislikes superman. Then, when they do fight it is about the coolest thing you can expect to see from a superhero film. 3.) I disagree with a lot of people about Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor. In my opinion, he played his role to perfection. 4.) B v S sets up Wonder Woman and Justice League with Gal Gadot's cameo as Wonder Woman and short clips of Aquaman, the Flash, and Cyborg. B v S is one of my favorite superhero films and rewatching it never gets old."

"The theatrical cut of this film is garbage which is why I rated it eight stars instead of nine. The first time I watched this film I didn't like it (not straight out hate but didn't like). Character motivations didn't make any sense, Lex was annoying as s***, editing was sloppy, and it was overly dark and broody for an action superhero movie. A year + a half, five Marvel films, a ton of bad reviews and a Justice League later a thought popped into my head: \"what if I watched BVS again\". This time I didn't have trailers ruining the best moments, I only vaguely remembered the film, and I was conditioned to look at it negatively but something unexpected happened: I actually loved it. Superman was just a normal person that tried to make a difference cause he could that others imposed their own beliefs on. Lex Luthor was a genius that couldn't stand his powerlessness compared to Superman or more accurately a super being. As Alfred said \"The fever, the rage, the feeling of powerlessness that turns good men... cruel\" and you see the same thought process in Batman. Batman, just like Lex Luthor feels powerless in the midst of a god-being and just like Lex he attempts to destroy him so he can get his sense of power back but unlike Lex, Batman learns something. I what is one of the corniest lines of the movie Superman says, \"Martha\" when he knows he can't win against Batman in a late desperate attempt to save his mother. Not only does this name connect with Bruce Wayne but it also shows what really matters to a man of steel: it isn't power, it isn't fame or anything else, it is his Mother and on a broader scale it is people. Lex (who doesn't care about people at all) knows he doesn't have the power so he creates something from his blood and the remains of Zod: A Doomsday for Superman. Not only does this film have depth but it also doesn't always explain it to you which is rare in a blockbuster action superhero flick normally cater to semi-comic book fans and people that want to shove popcorn in their mouths. This film rewards you for really noticing the details while still having massive explosions. One of my favorites is how Lex has all of Batman's branded killed which is why he isn't afraid of the branding at the end or Grandma's Peach Tea as a way of scaring the s*** out of someone. Of course, this film isn't perfect and I do have personal dislikes. The Batman V Superman fight was slow and pretty boring especially after watching such an amazing fight in Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 2 (If you haven't watched the animated Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 1 and 2 you are sorely missing out on something fantastic). Also, the addition of Wonder Woman who pretty much steals a hacker thing, gives it back and then suits up and fights against a giant monster thing. Not to say I don't like Wonder Woman (She is one of my favorite Superheroes of all time who showed not only can woman kick a** but they also don't need to be ashamed of their sexuality or gender) but she wasn't really that helpful to the plot and just brought in to expand the universe which was well done through Lex's superhuman hunting files. Also, the post-apocalyptic scene that was just a dream could have been cut but nothing is perfect except movies like Citizen Kane which isn't a lot of fun to watch cause it is too perfect. So to summarize, the theatrical cut is bad, the ultimate cut is Amazing and the other cut is meh. Please give it a second chance because it deserves it and save a good director from losing grace because of something he didn't do."
"I really liked it, don't know what all the hate is about. I'm actually a Marvel fan from when I was 7 or so, but Superman and Batman together in 1 movie? Just great. And personally I like Ben Affleck even better than Christian Bale as Batman. So just watch and enjoy, I know I did!"

"That's right. We have been waiting for these two heroes to finally meet and fight against each other. This movie is so good in both plot and special effects.Henry Cavill and Ben Affleck have performed well in their acting stages. They are the best superhero actors and they have filmed their fighting scenes very well. The movie starts to show the conflict between the lives of the heroes and now they have blamed each other for it. This movie is amazing and sets up a good plot for Dawn Justice."

"Actually...I didn't know what to expect. When you see Wonder Woman, you know it will be off of Wonder Woman and off of a Wonder Woman story, but with Batman V Superman, I was like, \"hmmmm, so who is this about?\" It was pretty obvious that it would feature many characters, but I thought the introduction to Batman was amazing. Ben Affleck nailed the part, not only as Batman but also as Bruce Wayne. He is my Batman. Henry Cavill continued to be super as the Man of Steel. And he is my Super - Man. A dark story? Yes, without a doubt. Could it have had a few more jokes? Sure. But not all movies or stories need to have jokes when certain events are serious. I really hope people can see this review and take another look at the movie, because, I loved it. I really hope the ratings can go up, eventually. And P.S, this movie is the perfect set up to Justice League."

"I'll start by making it clear I have only ever seen the Ultimate Edition. I'm aware of what was cut out for the theatrical release, so I will concede up front that most of the criticisms about pacing, editing, and missing bits of plot at release were merited.With that caveat out of the way, I must reiterate that this was bar-none the boldest superhero movie I have ever seen. To me, it was arguably the best as well, though \"best\" shouldn't be taken to mean \"most enjoyable.\" That honor easily goes to \"Thor: Ragnarok.\" What makes BvS stand out among other films in the genre is that it takes two characters who have been done to death since the 1970s and brings them up to date. I recently tried to watch \"Superman: The Movie\" for the first time in a number of years, and while it was still good and Reeves will always be iconic, I just couldn't take it seriously. I'll put it this way: If the story in BvS was \"stupid\" in your view but Superman turning back time by spinning the earth backward on its axis didn't seem like one of the dumbest things you have ever seen -in any movie from any genre- to the extent that it outright ruins the movie for you, then your opinion about BvS isn't worth much. Nostalgic bias was always going to be a problem for this movie, and the way people reacted to and reviewed \"Man of Steel\" was telling in this regard.That brings me to Zack Snyder's take on Superman. You know, that guy whose status as the first extraterrestrial ever encountered by humanity was a total non-issue in the old movies. Apparently, Snyder has a similar view to my own in that his take on the Man of Steel makes his being an alien a core piece of his identity. He may look like any other (absurdly attractive) person, but he knows what he is, and that makes him perpetually uncertain of where he fits in this world. He is essentially good and really does care about people, but he struggles to truly empathize with the likes of us. To be human is to be frail, and that is not something he can easily relate to. This is the root of his conflict with Batman.Just as Clark struggles to genuinely relate to most people, Snyder's Batman either refuses to or otherwise just can't relate to Superman. He doesn't see him as anything but a threat regardless of Superman's clear good intentions. Remember, a small group of Kryptonians were able to bring humanity to the brink of extinction in less than a day, and Bruce Wayne is nothing if not a realist. He didn't know the guy from Kansas. He only knew the god from another world.While Batman's anger toward and fear of Superman are readily apparent from the start, Superman's inability to imagine things from Bruce Wayne's perspective only becomes truly apparent during their first real interaction. This reminded me of the animated version of the \"world's finest\" storyline, where Superman judges Batman harshly for using fear tactics and threats of violence (also, actual violence) to get the job done. Superman wasn't willing to consider what it would take for a human man to fight criminals and save innocents, or what that life would do to him over time. Just as Batman didn't see the guy from Kansas, Superman didn't see the man who lives his life trapped in one brutal, unthinkably traumatic moment (this was beautifully conveyed during the film's opening moments), and had spent his whole adult life bearing witness to humanity at its absolute worst.The conflict between these two characters is as old as human history. They want the same things, but they can't understand one another. So they fight. And what a fight it was.Watching a fight between, say, Captain America and Iron Man was, to me, more frustrating than anything because each understood the other's perspective perfectly. The fight between Batman and Superman in BvS was genuinely gut-wrenching, as intended, because they would have understood one another if either had tried. The whole sequence hilighted Batman's tactical prowess and ability to control a situation. Maybe the most badass thing about the fight was that it ended exactly where Batman planned. That brings me to the big elephant in the room named \"Martha.\"I can't recall exactly which YouTuber put it this way, but if you thought the \"save Martha\" exchange was about their mothers having the same name, you had your brain turned off. The brain-on people have explained this to death, but it bears repeating. This was the moment when Superman became humanized to Batman. He was about to die, and his only concern was for his adoptive human mother. He still believed that the man about to take his life would do the right thing. Even with the cowl on, there was no mistaking the look on Batman's face. It was the look of shame, guilt, and sudden uncertainty that says \"What am I doing?\" Turns out even the most brutal, angry version of Bruce Wayne is better than Tony Stark at knowing right from wrong. At knowing that he had gone too far.From there, the third act was a series of truly impressive (albeit mostly CGI) fight sequences, beginning with what I regard as the undisputed champion of Batman fights. Nothing in the Nolan movies (and especially nothing in the Burton movies) even came close. Go ahead, try to convince yourself that Batman and Bane taking turns punching one another in the face until Bane's mask broke was a good fight sequence. No, this was a fight straight out of \"Arkham Knight,\" and it was glorious. The battle against Doomsday really was one for the books. From the moment Wonder Woman arrived accompanied by the intense sounds of Tina Guo's electric cello to Superman's tragic, heroic death at the hands of Doomsday, I was glued to the screen. Sure, the mere presence of Doomsday spoiled the end to a degree, but watching the Man of Steel laboring to carry that kryptonite spear towards certain death was no less impactful. A brief word on Jesse Eisenberg's take on Lex Luthor. At least one other reviewer on this site already said it best when they pointed out that this was his origin story. If you consider his scheme objectively, he is actually one of the more formidable incarnations of the character. If we're lucky, we'll eventually get to see a Snyder Cut of \"Justice League\" and find out where this story was actually meant to go. For the record, Joss Whedon and Danny Elfman both should have said \"no\" to taking a dump on someone else's art."
"BATMAN V SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE brings a fantastic surprise to a smash-hit team-up with one of the worlds most beloved DC Comics' icons of all time. The movie delivers spectacular casting, and fantastic acting with different characters having their shine in each scenes.The story follows Clark Kent/Superman who becomes a threat, after the destruction in Metropolis in Man Of Steel.(2013). Batman/Bruce Wayne sees him as a threat and begins his war on Superman.The movie brings spectacular storytelling, it tells the complications of human against alien who are on the same side, and the first meeting of Batman and Superman. The story of Bruce Wayne, with his many years of The Caped Crusader, sends him on a spiral of \"out of control\", sheer anger, and builds tension to wanting to defeat the Man of Steel. Snyder has fantastically gave this storytelling an exciting nod to the comics.Lex Luthor, played by Jesse Einsberg, delivers a very interesting performance, but very differently by him showing is his \"origin\" before he becomes a bald foe to the Man of Steel. He shows that his love of \"god vs man\" terrorises mankind when he ultimately creates Doomsday, and Batman realises Superman's inner heroism.It packs so many great \"out of nowhere\" excitement, including a first-look of the fearful Wonder Woman a.k.a. Diana Prince, played by Gal Gadot, and a fresh-new glimpse of the superhero DC canon: The Justice League.WATCH THIS MOVIE! The critics are out of their mind. It's a fun-packed action adventure which still keeps the movie enjoyable until it's final minutes of the movie. It's a FANTASTIC MOVIE! BEN AFFLECK AS BATMAN... is Incredible!A 10/10 overall!"
"I want to go on record as saying that this is a truly thrilling cinematic experience in so many ways. If pressed, I guess I could acknowledge that there were a couple ... let's say \"clumsy\" moments. And in a film that runs to three hours, that hardly seems like a significant issue, certainly not enough to rate it with fewer than 9 stars.This film has everything. There is dramatic tension right from the start. There is a magnificent story arc that picks up quite seamlessly from 'Man of Steel' and propels the viewer not only into the life of Clark Kent/Superman but also of Bruce Wayne/Batman.The villain is no mere cartoon of a villain; he is truly thoroughly (and apparently irrevocably) diabolical. He is a psychopath, and you wish for his death over and over and over. You want Superman to reduce him to ash with the power of his eyes.I have read a number of viewers' reviews, and it seems that the people who disliked the film / gave it a low rating had rather unfair and unrealistic expectations of it. That is, their own prejudices about how the plot could/should unfold or what the character development could/should be, etc. ruined the film for them. And that is a shame.My thought is: I settle into my seat, wait for the lights to dim, and then I wait to be transported by the film. I accept it, lock, stock, and barrel.As another reviewer remarked, I love how the film begins from the point of view of Bruce Wayne as he is among people on the ground who have fallen victim to the attack of Zod and the other Kryptonians.Why would Bruce Wayne not like Superman? Why would the good people of Earth hurl insults at Superman and burn him in effigy (on the news)? Because the good people of Earth just got catapulted into a new reality in which there are not only extraterrestrial beings (surprise!) but they are also superman! And a group of them are hell-bent on destroying humankind and taking the planet for themselves.It is difficult to see Superman as separate from the whole Kryptonian Krew.It seems that many moviegoers forgot that Bruce Wayne is also human. Sure, he's a hero, but he is flawed.. Just like the rest of us. He is a vigilante, after all.He has let his vigilantism get the better of him. HE is actually the one working outside the boundaries of the law, not Superman. It is the clear head of Alfred that shows us that he has gone into a rather dark place, that he has not seen what is really going on (in Luthor's scheme), and so he chooses to embark on his own scheme scheme to take out the alien invader. He is (allegedly) thinking of the future: if he wipes out the all-powerful alien, then it can't turn on humankind in the future. At least, he convinces himself of that.A philosophical question is raised in the film: should Clark Kent have remained a simple man from Kansas and never have become the Superman? Should he just let people die and let calamities happen? The question is answered for us in the character of Diana Prince/Wonder Woman. She withdrew from mankind (her exact words) and just sat around watching. Watching while people died horrible deaths all around her. So, should Superman have done the same? Do these special beings, these 'metahumans', have some kind of moral imperative to intervene, or should they be allowed to be regular people, too? It seems that humans want it both ways.It seems that humans are saying: \"Don't be a superalien ... except when I and my friends and family are in trouble. Then come save us.\""

"Batman v Superman: Ultimate Edition: If your looking for a quick, cheap thrill then you might not enjoy this film at the time. This movies theatrical version was butchered by WB and in doing so reshaped the story leaving numerous plot holes. So the Ultimate Edition is the full story and the one worth seeing. Watch 'Man of Steel' before seeing this movie. There is much to claw through here, so much so that the audience might easily find themselves exhausted from the overall aggression of the film. However, a lot of the story does work. The action is good, and the emotion feels real most of the time.This film is about Superman trying to become Superman. Trying to help the world, save people, find a place in this world not as an outcast, and yet is looked at has a threat by many. Superman is not from this world, yet He is trying to be human, find a place in this world, be excepted by earths people, and come into his destiny.This film is also about Batman being Batman for 20 years and losing faith in humanity, and fearing Superman, what Superman can do with his powers. Great film, great plot, great visuals. ---Yidioo"
"I didn't see the film in the theaters and just bought the \"Extended Edition \" on Amazon. I never properly saw Man of Steel- i think I rented it and watched it when already exhausted and fell asleep. I saw the mediocre user reviews and horrible reviews from critics of this film.They really have it wrong. This is the very best either Batman or Superman. It has a different take, on things. Much darker then earlier films even darker then the Christopher Nolan Batman films.First of all Christopher Nolan is an Executive Producer. So how bad could it be? I loved Sucker Punch and Zack Snyder was involved with that. So how bad could this be? Hans Zimmer did the music, so how bad could it be?I remember watching the old Superman TV shows and reading the Superman and Batman comics as a little kid and loved them, but i wouldn't call myself a \"fan boy\" of comic universes, like so many younger people today. As an older adult I will admit my favorite TV show of all time was Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but watched it on DVD only after it had finished. I saw the second of the Dark Knight series in the theater, but the other two, I watched on DVD. They were great, but not my favorite films like so many people. i also loved the first couple Superman and Batman films in the older series. Regardless, i was not waiting with baited breath to see Man of Steel or this one.I'm more of a serious film fan, who can watch Stanley Kubrick films over and over and my favorite films in the last twenty years, are Eyes Wide Shut and Intersteller, both of which i've watched multiple times.So, with that said, take it from me, the critics have this film very wrong, just as critics hated 2001: A Space Odyssey when it first came out. This film will have lasting appreciation.Surprised how much I liked Ben Afleck's Batman. it was hard to get into Henry Cavil's scrawnier looking Superman, but it grew on me. Amy Adams was great as Lois Lane, The Gal Gadol Wonder Women was amazing. Lex Luther was terrific, like Nolan's Joker. Jeremy Irons was the best Alfred ever. Holly Hunter and Diane Lane was good too. The movie had bad reviews but made a billion dollars. Hopefully everyone buys the Ultimate Edition and it breaks sales records and the film is re-appreciated. I have no idea what scenes this Ultimate Edition added, but it is pretty perfect. Now I can't wait for Wonder Woman and the Justice League and as soon as I finish writing this am going to watch Man of Steal. I'm into it now!I can only surmise that the bad reviews stem from too much expectations of the rigid fan boy types and the radical changes in tone, we see in this film.Total masterpiece of cinema, but I have a few criticisms. There are a few hollow scenes of typical Idiot cops and authorities getting everything wrong in a cliché type way and it has a few filler scenes of that type and a few moments here and there that felt rushed and cheesy. Maybe not everything restored into the Ultimate Edition should have been. I wish there had been more Kevin Costner scenes."

"The whole entire Batman V Superman movie was great and yes even though it felt slow to the majority of the people who watched it but to me I enjoyed every part and every scene of Batman V Superman and when it got to the fight scenes both batman VS Superman and the Doomsday fight it brought so much drama, intensity, and epic performances. So with that being said I give this movie a good 10/10 because it really did go to my expectations and it brought a powerful performance and a powerful yet epic introduction to the upcoming Justice League."

"Zack Snyder not only understands the characters but he also understands how to craft a real amazing movie for fans - honestly blew me away (extended cut) Brilliant!Don't believe what the internet is telling you to think - take this from a person who has worked in the comic book industry - this is amazing!"

"When I first wrote a review for this movie a year ago exclaiming my excitement for the film, I had been high off a fresh dose of live-action DC superheroes playing out the beloved comic book stories that I had grown up on. It was all playing out before my eyes and coming to life. After a few months had passed, I began to notice things about the movie that I disliked: little gaps in the story, things that didn't add up, etc. My original rating of a 10 / 10 dropped to an 8 /10. But today it has gone back up to a 10. The extended version of the film not only rectifies the gaps but also silences critics.Many claimed that the movie was too dark or that it just didn't make sense. To those people, I say: \"Pick up a comic book!\" Many of the critics of this particular film were part of the superhero bandwagon that formed when Marvel began its spree of Avengers-related films. In fact, its estimated that over 60% of people who go to see 'superhero' genre films have never picked up a comic book in their life. I would argue that similar numbers could figure to those which view the CW televised DC Universe shows. People complain that DC comics is just too dark but the fact is that these movies are based upon actual comics which are meant to be dark (ex: The Dark Knight Returns, Injustice, etc.). Its like complaining that Game of Thrones (the TV series) sucks because they kill off too many characters. Read the books! Its frustrating to see such a beautiful work of art like Batman V Superman criticized by those ignorant to its universe and its meaning. This movie is in fact a catalyst that opens numerous doorways and leaves true fans in awe of the possibilities for future movies. But regardless of whether or not people choose to educate themselves, this film's DVD/Blu-ray extended version puts the theater release to shame. All of the plot holes and gaps are filled in 30 minutes of extended footage scattered throughout the film. The movie ultimately becomes more complete and people will wish that the movie had shown the full 3 hours of footage in its theatrical debut. As a major DC comics fan, I will of course pick up on things that a comics fan would not, but someone who does not read comics would learn to appreciate this film in its entirety with the extended version. Get your hands on a copy today or find it on Netflix or the internet somewhere!"

"I ignored the bad reviews and watched anyways. This film had a lot to live up to after Civil War was released and I went into this film expecting the worst. It ended up to be the best Superhero film of 2016 to me. One complaint was that this film was more concerned about universe building than telling a great story than Civil War but for me it was the other way around; Civil War felt like a build up to something else and to be honest, I felt that way when I saw the other MCU films. Batman vs Superman however not only had a great story, but it also felt a lot more consistent than Civil War. This film was way more diverse with the cast than the MCU but unlike the MCU, I felt like this film doesn't go overboard with the SJW stuff like the MCU films or The Star Wars Sequel films do. The Visuals were AMAZING, The Score by Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL was AMAZING as well, The Tone is just right as I actually felt for the characters emotionally, The Cinematography kept my eyes glued to the screen, and the script felt really Intelligent and Complex and despite people calling the writing confusing, I was able to piece it together with no problem whatsoever. This film is similar to Empire Strikes back in terms of popularity so over time after the other movies are released, this movie would probably be more popular.This film was way better than I Expected and deserves another chance.

"Its shame to see what critics and marvel fans did to this movie and targeted Zack Snyder for it. I have seen this movie more than 25 times till date. And i enjoy this movie as much as i enjoyed the first time. The fans who have read DC comics, wouldn't be disappointed in this movie. Its dark movie, yes it is. Because the title shows the intense situation at hand. Two superheroes about to rip each other apart for whatever reasons that brought them to this stage. Yes it had to be dark and intense.Only marvel can be stupid enough to show an alien invasion where humans are loosing the battle and the super heroes are cracking jokes while battles as if they are playing ping pong. a person playing Call of Duty game is more serious while playing than the marvel heroes fighting aliens."

"Last week some news came out from somebody online who had claimed to have seen a finished version of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. If you were like me, you've been leery of checking it out because you weren't sure how much might actually be true. Now Zack Snyder has spoken out about the spoiler-filled post, although his response doesn't really clear anything up.In a word, to MTV, he called the post \"hilarious,which might imply that he's saying that it's mostly, if not entirely, untrue. That might be the case, but then again he could have just said it was untrue and he didn't say that. What he did say, however, is that he doesn't like spoilers. While this may seem odd for the director who's most recent trailer appeared to give away the entire movie, Snyder says that's not the case. Even if you've seen the trailer, you can rest easy, as there is much more we have not seen in then finished film. Says Snyder I have the benefit of seeing the movie. It's cool that think it's too much, and I appreciate people not wanting to know, but there's plenty that they don't know. There's a lot of movie that's not in the trailer. In the process of calling the Batman v Superman Reddit review hilarious, Snyder goes on to talk about how he hates it when spoilers come out. The director would much rather that fans see the movie mostly blind. While he understands that some fans may wish to find the answers before hand, he wants his movies to be mysteries going in. If you're, as an audience member, exploring these articles, looking for answers to questions that you have, maybe you're okay with knowing before you go. It's like an individual taste. But like I said, I want people to see the movie without knowing.Spoilers are a topic that mean different things to different people. While most try to avoid them to some degree, the need to solve the mystery is a nearly universal human experience. We have an inclination to want to know the truth, even while also wanting to be surprised. For most of us getting some information is good, but getting all the information is bad, of course, only getting the details that you want can be difficult."
"The theatrical is choppy, poorly edited, hard to follow, with some really good moments mixed in their. The extended is much more fluent and is much easier to follow, it does have a long runtime, which might make it seem a bit dragging on, but if you like long films done right, like Lord of the Rings, you will like this movie as long as you get into the characters and story. Speaking of which, the story starts out perfectly showing Bruce Wayne as a character, and it is very powerful. There are several moments in this movie that are powerful, emotional, and shocking. Characters. Batman is my favorite fictional character of all time, and believe me when I say, Ben Affleck as Batman was perfect, he had the charisma, the anger, and the look of being through some bad stuff Gal Gadot also does perfect as Wonder Woman, but if you want to really see how good she does, go watch the Wonder Woman movie. Henry Call as Superman. I really don't like it when people say Christopher Reeves is better. Don't get me wrong, Reeves does great, but can you imagine him as Superman in this movie? I wouldn't like it. It would be like Adam West playing Batman in The Dark Knight. Henry Cavill does great in this role, I can say everything about him as I said with Ben Affleck. Jesse Eisenberg as Luthor. I thought it was different in a good way. I've heard a criticism for him as being too much like Joker, but is that a bad thing? Joker is my favorite villain, so to see Superman have an enemy that crazy, but still hold the values Luthor needs to be Luthor, I think it is great. The thing I thought this movie was lacking in the first and second acts was humor, at least good humor. If there was more humor, I would've given this movie a ten because it would give a more relaxing feel to the parts that needed it. All in all though, this movie was awesome, it had powerful moments, it was badass, and just plain fun. It had a great story arc and does its job very well."

"*I will be talking about the Ultimate Edition of the film* This was one of the most anticipated CBM of all time. Ever since the arrival and subsequent success of Marvel's The Avengers people have wondered when will DC launch its own cinematic universe, one of the main reasons being the opportunity to finally see titans such as Batman and Superman share the screen together: the ultimate nerd dream. On 2016, the moment finally came for BvS to be released AND.. it performed poorly. Not only did critical reception left a lot to be desired, but fan reactions where surprisingly split after its cinematic debut. People either loved it and called Zack a genius, or hated it and called him a hack. Me, personally, I found myself with middle of the road feelings, for sure, but more leaning towards the negative side with subsequent viewings. The theatrical cut of the film showcased amazing performances, incredible visuals, and action set pieces that seemed like comic book panels come to life, in a good way. However, when it comes to its narrative structure and more technical aspects like editing, the film was seriously flawed. More plot holes than Age of Ultron, questionable character decisions, random editing that lacked cohesion and focus, and forced dramatic moments that lacked any impact because the attempts at character development ranged from limited to nonexistent, especially when it comes to Superman's character. I thought it was a 5/10 movie at best. As such, I was kind of skeptical about the idea of a 30 minute longer version. I say kind of because I know how Zack works. I remember Watchmen being vastly improved with its director's cut, so in a way I was expecting BvS to perform in a similar manner, but I also feared those 30 minutes wold be just there to amplify action and discredit storytelling issues. Oh boy, I'm so glad I was proved wrong. The ultimate cut of the film was infuriating, but not because it was awful, but because it questions the sanity of WB executives and editors and makes you wonder what were they thinking during the editing process. What I got out of the Ultimate Edition was a thought-provoking deconstruction of two very iconic superheroes that gave spotlight to the struggles both of them face when they aren't fighting crime. What I got was an extremely well produced character study on both Batman and Superman in a cynical world, a world dangerously close to our own. We meet Batman as a ruthless, worn out hero that has seen the failure behind his ideals and witnessed some truly horrifying things in his life. Superman, on the other hand, is portrayed as a godlike figure that seeks to do good in the world, but finds himself emotionally conflicted once he realized that every good deed he does leaves behind a trail of destruction (most of it due to Luthor's antics). In my opinion, this is a hugely original approach, one that distances itself from the rest of the competition and delivers a dark, somber, yet relevant superhero movie that understands both characters and gives them real human struggles to deal with. I felt invested in both of them, and hoped that by the end of the film both could find a way to redeem themselves. Their character arcs were very well established during the first two acts of the movie, and by the time we get to the titular climactic battle the emotion behind the jaw-dropping action is intensified. Lex Luthor as a villain was also given more time to develop with this new edition. One of the main criticisms with the original version was the fact that his plan relied too much on conveniences, and the character's mannerisms and mad-scientist attitude was annoying, and that goes without saying his motivations were unclear. Not only do we spend more time understanding his hate for any godlike figure and thus his hatred for Superman, but the added scenes allowed us to witness his entire plan come to fruition. It sells the cold, manipulative, calculating attributes of his comic counterpart. The acting is spot on. Every actor owns his/her role, from Cavill's Superman, to Ben Affleck as Batman, Eisenberg as Luthor, and Gadot as Wonder Woman, whose scenes are brief, but are more than enough to sell the strong and ferocious warrior that she is. Cinematography is stunning, and miles above that of Man of Steel's. And the soundtrack by Zimmer and Junkie XL? Perfect, just perfect. When it comes to flaws, the film still has some of those. The Martha moment, while serving as a pivotal character moment for Batman, felt off in execution, and its understandable that many people got mad at it. If your main complaint about BvS the first time around was its bleak tone and subject matter, this film is still not for you. I understand most were expecting to see the heroes being the most iconic versions of themselves, clashing in an elongated battle and evoking the same feelings The Avengers gave audiences back in 2012. In that sense, the film will remain divisive, but at least I have the comfort of saying that, at the very least, the film is competently made."

"This film was amazing. Ben Affleck was easily the best part of this movie, he brought his a-game as Batman. The chemistry between Affleck & Irons was outstanding. Gal Gadot did a great job as Wonder Woman. The fight between Batman & Superman was awesome. The final fight with Doomsday was outstanding in every way possible. However, there is only one problem with this film and that's Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor. He was sadly missed cast in this role, but then again it's really the fault of Warner Bros. Studios. Overall, this film deliver on almost every level. I highly recommend that you watch the extended version of this film."

"I know I know. I saw it in theaters too, and felt like it could've been so much better. While the Batman element was good, the narrative felt fractured, and the third act was just one long stunt scene. Superman was relegated to a supporting character, and other characters didn't get a chance to shine. And then I chanced on the ultimate cut. Calling it 30 mins of \"extra\" footage is unfair to Zack Snyder because it's exactly these 30 mins that makes the movie a worthy one. What I can say about the theatrical cut is this - It had the blockbuster elements - music, visuals, stunts, CGI. But, it lacked the human elements. The first 20 mins of the movie had it, but not after that. The extended cut in comparison has a flow to the narrative. There are no disjointed scenes, everything flows smoothly, and there's connective tissue. Superman gets to spend some time with his father, and mother. Clark Kent does some investigative journalism. Superman helps the people after the blast. Lois Lane doesn't jump to conclusions, she gets to the bottom of the crime. Lex Luthor apparently had a coherent plan - everything is explained pretty well. Wonder Woman was already good, so there's no change there :) Also, the \"Martha\" scene seems better executed, because it is a few seconds longer, and there's time to breathe it in. So, here's my take on this movie - The theatrical cut was junk. Get the Bluray for ultimate edition, and you shall not be disappointed. I've seen it so many more times now, and it's the definitive cut. It is the movie we deserve. It's a unique take on Batman, and Superman. It's a gritty take on the superhero movie genre, and definitely the best DCEU movie, and the best DC movie since The Dark Knight.P.S. Yes it's dark. We're adults, and we should appreciate mature film making without intentionally silly moments. It attempts to be philosophical, and something deep instead of just trying to make you chuckle."

"This is one of the best superhero movies ever made. Zack Snyder is a magician behind the camera.The reason behind so many complaints is the fact that Warner Bros. marketed this movie as a fight between Batman and Superman. That's not what it is. It's a movie about the origins of the Justice League.The cinematography, the acting and the score are all second to none. This film is phenomenal.P.S: watch the 3 hour extended cut that Snyder intended you to see, not the 2 and a half hour movie that Warner Bros. decided would be better for theaters."

"I don't care what the critics say, this is a very well-done movie. I'll start my review by listing what I like about the movie.1.) Ben Affleck is the best batman to me and it is not close. He pulls off the role of an aging batman extremely well. Also, Zack Snyder's vision of batman is legit. I have always hated batman up until this adaptation of him. Instead of being a conflicted and idealistic batman, this batman is dark, gritty, and 100% a badass. His equipment is decked out with machine guns and he has no aversion to killing people. In fact, he probably kills about 50 criminal by the time this movie is over. The warehouse scene is the coolest batman scene in any movie.2.) The development of a grudge between batman and superman is pulled off flawlessly. It actually makes sense why batman dislikes superman. Then, when they do fight it is about the coolest thing you can expect to see from a superhero film. 3.) I disagree with a lot of people about Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor. In my opinion, he played his role to perfection. 4.) B v S sets up Wonder Woman and Justice League with Gal Gadot's cameo as Wonder Woman and short clips of Aquaman, the Flash, and Cyborg. B v S is one of my favorite superhero films and rewatching it never gets old."

"The theatrical cut of this film is garbage which is why I rated it eight stars instead of nine. The first time I watched this film I didn't like it (not straight out hate but didn't like). Character motivations didn't make any sense, Lex was annoying as s***, editing was sloppy, and it was overly dark and broody for an action superhero movie. A year + a half, five Marvel films, a ton of bad reviews and a Justice League later a thought popped into my head: \"what if I watched BVS again\". This time I didn't have trailers ruining the best moments, I only vaguely remembered the film, and I was conditioned to look at it negatively but something unexpected happened: I actually loved it. Superman was just a normal person that tried to make a difference cause he could that others imposed their own beliefs on. Lex Luthor was a genius that couldn't stand his powerlessness compared to Superman or more accurately a super being. As Alfred said \"The fever, the rage, the feeling of powerlessness that turns good men... cruel\" and you see the same thought process in Batman. Batman, just like Lex Luthor feels powerless in the midst of a god-being and just like Lex he attempts to destroy him so he can get his sense of power back but unlike Lex, Batman learns something. I what is one of the corniest lines of the movie Superman says, \"Martha\" when he knows he can't win against Batman in a late desperate attempt to save his mother. Not only does this name connect with Bruce Wayne but it also shows what really matters to a man of steel: it isn't power, it isn't fame or anything else, it is his Mother and on a broader scale it is people. Lex (who doesn't care about people at all) knows he doesn't have the power so he creates something from his blood and the remains of Zod: A Doomsday for Superman. Not only does this film have depth but it also doesn't always explain it to you which is rare in a blockbuster action superhero flick normally cater to semi-comic book fans and people that want to shove popcorn in their mouths. This film rewards you for really noticing the details while still having massive explosions. One of my favorites is how Lex has all of Batman's branded killed which is why he isn't afraid of the branding at the end or Grandma's Peach Tea as a way of scaring the s*** out of someone. Of course, this film isn't perfect and I do have personal dislikes. The Batman V Superman fight was slow and pretty boring especially after watching such an amazing fight in Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 2 (If you haven't watched the animated Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 1 and 2 you are sorely missing out on something fantastic). Also, the addition of Wonder Woman who pretty much steals a hacker thing, gives it back and then suits up and fights against a giant monster thing. Not to say I don't like Wonder Woman (She is one of my favorite Superheroes of all time who showed not only can woman kick a** but they also don't need to be ashamed of their sexuality or gender) but she wasn't really that helpful to the plot and just brought in to expand the universe which was well done through Lex's superhuman hunting files. Also, the post-apocalyptic scene that was just a dream could have been cut but nothing is perfect except movies like Citizen Kane which isn't a lot of fun to watch cause it is too perfect. So to summarize, the theatrical cut is bad, the ultimate cut is Amazing and the other cut is meh. Please give it a second chance because it deserves it and save a good director from losing grace because of something he didn't do."
"I really liked it, don't know what all the hate is about. I'm actually a Marvel fan from when I was 7 or so, but Superman and Batman together in 1 movie? Just great. And personally I like Ben Affleck even better than Christian Bale as Batman. So just watch and enjoy, I know I did!"

"That's right. We have been waiting for these two heroes to finally meet and fight against each other. This movie is so good in both plot and special effects.Henry Cavill and Ben Affleck have performed well in their acting stages. They are the best superhero actors and they have filmed their fighting scenes very well. The movie starts to show the conflict between the lives of the heroes and now they have blamed each other for it. This movie is amazing and sets up a good plot for Dawn Justice."

"Actually...I didn't know what to expect. When you see Wonder Woman, you know it will be off of Wonder Woman and off of a Wonder Woman story, but with Batman V Superman, I was like, \"hmmmm, so who is this about?\" It was pretty obvious that it would feature many characters, but I thought the introduction to Batman was amazing. Ben Affleck nailed the part, not only as Batman but also as Bruce Wayne. He is my Batman. Henry Cavill continued to be super as the Man of Steel. And he is my Super - Man. A dark story? Yes, without a doubt. Could it have had a few more jokes? Sure. But not all movies or stories need to have jokes when certain events are serious. I really hope people can see this review and take another look at the movie, because, I loved it. I really hope the ratings can go up, eventually. And P.S, this movie is the perfect set up to Justice League."

"I'll start by making it clear I have only ever seen the Ultimate Edition. I'm aware of what was cut out for the theatrical release, so I will concede up front that most of the criticisms about pacing, editing, and missing bits of plot at release were merited.With that caveat out of the way, I must reiterate that this was bar-none the boldest superhero movie I have ever seen. To me, it was arguably the best as well, though \"best\" shouldn't be taken to mean \"most enjoyable.\" That honor easily goes to \"Thor: Ragnarok.\" What makes BvS stand out among other films in the genre is that it takes two characters who have been done to death since the 1970s and brings them up to date. I recently tried to watch \"Superman: The Movie\" for the first time in a number of years, and while it was still good and Reeves will always be iconic, I just couldn't take it seriously. I'll put it this way: If the story in BvS was \"stupid\" in your view but Superman turning back time by spinning the earth backward on its axis didn't seem like one of the dumbest things you have ever seen -in any movie from any genre- to the extent that it outright ruins the movie for you, then your opinion about BvS isn't worth much. Nostalgic bias was always going to be a problem for this movie, and the way people reacted to and reviewed \"Man of Steel\" was telling in this regard.That brings me to Zack Snyder's take on Superman. You know, that guy whose status as the first extraterrestrial ever encountered by humanity was a total non-issue in the old movies. Apparently, Snyder has a similar view to my own in that his take on the Man of Steel makes his being an alien a core piece of his identity. He may look like any other (absurdly attractive) person, but he knows what he is, and that makes him perpetually uncertain of where he fits in this world. He is essentially good and really does care about people, but he struggles to truly empathize with the likes of us. To be human is to be frail, and that is not something he can easily relate to. This is the root of his conflict with Batman.Just as Clark struggles to genuinely relate to most people, Snyder's Batman either refuses to or otherwise just can't relate to Superman. He doesn't see him as anything but a threat regardless of Superman's clear good intentions. Remember, a small group of Kryptonians were able to bring humanity to the brink of extinction in less than a day, and Bruce Wayne is nothing if not a realist. He didn't know the guy from Kansas. He only knew the god from another world.While Batman's anger toward and fear of Superman are readily apparent from the start, Superman's inability to imagine things from Bruce Wayne's perspective only becomes truly apparent during their first real interaction. This reminded me of the animated version of the \"world's finest\" storyline, where Superman judges Batman harshly for using fear tactics and threats of violence (also, actual violence) to get the job done. Superman wasn't willing to consider what it would take for a human man to fight criminals and save innocents, or what that life would do to him over time. Just as Batman didn't see the guy from Kansas, Superman didn't see the man who lives his life trapped in one brutal, unthinkably traumatic moment (this was beautifully conveyed during the film's opening moments), and had spent his whole adult life bearing witness to humanity at its absolute worst.The conflict between these two characters is as old as human history. They want the same things, but they can't understand one another. So they fight. And what a fight it was.Watching a fight between, say, Captain America and Iron Man was, to me, more frustrating than anything because each understood the other's perspective perfectly. The fight between Batman and Superman in BvS was genuinely gut-wrenching, as intended, because they would have understood one another if either had tried. The whole sequence hilighted Batman's tactical prowess and ability to control a situation. Maybe the most badass thing about the fight was that it ended exactly where Batman planned. That brings me to the big elephant in the room named \"Martha.\"I can't recall exactly which YouTuber put it this way, but if you thought the \"save Martha\" exchange was about their mothers having the same name, you had your brain turned off. The brain-on people have explained this to death, but it bears repeating. This was the moment when Superman became humanized to Batman. He was about to die, and his only concern was for his adoptive human mother. He still believed that the man about to take his life would do the right thing. Even with the cowl on, there was no mistaking the look on Batman's face. It was the look of shame, guilt, and sudden uncertainty that says \"What am I doing?\" Turns out even the most brutal, angry version of Bruce Wayne is better than Tony Stark at knowing right from wrong. At knowing that he had gone too far.From there, the third act was a series of truly impressive (albeit mostly CGI) fight sequences, beginning with what I regard as the undisputed champion of Batman fights. Nothing in the Nolan movies (and especially nothing in the Burton movies) even came close. Go ahead, try to convince yourself that Batman and Bane taking turns punching one another in the face until Bane's mask broke was a good fight sequence. No, this was a fight straight out of \"Arkham Knight,\" and it was glorious. The battle against Doomsday really was one for the books. From the moment Wonder Woman arrived accompanied by the intense sounds of Tina Guo's electric cello to Superman's tragic, heroic death at the hands of Doomsday, I was glued to the screen. Sure, the mere presence of Doomsday spoiled the end to a degree, but watching the Man of Steel laboring to carry that kryptonite spear towards certain death was no less impactful. A brief word on Jesse Eisenberg's take on Lex Luthor. At least one other reviewer on this site already said it best when they pointed out that this was his origin story. If you consider his scheme objectively, he is actually one of the more formidable incarnations of the character. If we're lucky, we'll eventually get to see a Snyder Cut of \"Justice League\" and find out where this story was actually meant to go. For the record, Joss Whedon and Danny Elfman both should have said \"no\" to taking a dump on someone else's art."
"BATMAN V SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE brings a fantastic surprise to a smash-hit team-up with one of the worlds most beloved DC Comics' icons of all time. The movie delivers spectacular casting, and fantastic acting with different characters having their shine in each scenes.The story follows Clark Kent/Superman who becomes a threat, after the destruction in Metropolis in Man Of Steel.(2013). Batman/Bruce Wayne sees him as a threat and begins his war on Superman.The movie brings spectacular storytelling, it tells the complications of human against alien who are on the same side, and the first meeting of Batman and Superman. The story of Bruce Wayne, with his many years of The Caped Crusader, sends him on a spiral of \"out of control\", sheer anger, and builds tension to wanting to defeat the Man of Steel. Snyder has fantastically gave this storytelling an exciting nod to the comics.Lex Luthor, played by Jesse Einsberg, delivers a very interesting performance, but very differently by him showing is his \"origin\" before he becomes a bald foe to the Man of Steel. He shows that his love of \"god vs man\" terrorises mankind when he ultimately creates Doomsday, and Batman realises Superman's inner heroism.It packs so many great \"out of nowhere\" excitement, including a first-look of the fearful Wonder Woman a.k.a. Diana Prince, played by Gal Gadot, and a fresh-new glimpse of the superhero DC canon: The Justice League.WATCH THIS MOVIE! The critics are out of their mind. It's a fun-packed action adventure which still keeps the movie enjoyable until it's final minutes of the movie. It's a FANTASTIC MOVIE! BEN AFFLECK AS BATMAN... is Incredible!A 10/10 overall!"
"I want to go on record as saying that this is a truly thrilling cinematic experience in so many ways. If pressed, I guess I could acknowledge that there were a couple ... let's say \"clumsy\" moments. And in a film that runs to three hours, that hardly seems like a significant issue, certainly not enough to rate it with fewer than 9 stars.This film has everything. There is dramatic tension right from the start. There is a magnificent story arc that picks up quite seamlessly from 'Man of Steel' and propels the viewer not only into the life of Clark Kent/Superman but also of Bruce Wayne/Batman.The villain is no mere cartoon of a villain; he is truly thoroughly (and apparently irrevocably) diabolical. He is a psychopath, and you wish for his death over and over and over. You want Superman to reduce him to ash with the power of his eyes.I have read a number of viewers' reviews, and it seems that the people who disliked the film / gave it a low rating had rather unfair and unrealistic expectations of it. That is, their own prejudices about how the plot could/should unfold or what the character development could/should be, etc. ruined the film for them. And that is a shame.My thought is: I settle into my seat, wait for the lights to dim, and then I wait to be transported by the film. I accept it, lock, stock, and barrel.As another reviewer remarked, I love how the film begins from the point of view of Bruce Wayne as he is among people on the ground who have fallen victim to the attack of Zod and the other Kryptonians.Why would Bruce Wayne not like Superman? Why would the good people of Earth hurl insults at Superman and burn him in effigy (on the news)? Because the good people of Earth just got catapulted into a new reality in which there are not only extraterrestrial beings (surprise!) but they are also superman! And a group of them are hell-bent on destroying humankind and taking the planet for themselves.It is difficult to see Superman as separate from the whole Kryptonian Krew.It seems that many moviegoers forgot that Bruce Wayne is also human. Sure, he's a hero, but he is flawed.. Just like the rest of us. He is a vigilante, after all.He has let his vigilantism get the better of him. HE is actually the one working outside the boundaries of the law, not Superman. It is the clear head of Alfred that shows us that he has gone into a rather dark place, that he has not seen what is really going on (in Luthor's scheme), and so he chooses to embark on his own scheme scheme to take out the alien invader. He is (allegedly) thinking of the future: if he wipes out the all-powerful alien, then it can't turn on humankind in the future. At least, he convinces himself of that.A philosophical question is raised in the film: should Clark Kent have remained a simple man from Kansas and never have become the Superman? Should he just let people die and let calamities happen? The question is answered for us in the character of Diana Prince/Wonder Woman. She withdrew from mankind (her exact words) and just sat around watching. Watching while people died horrible deaths all around her. So, should Superman have done the same? Do these special beings, these 'metahumans', have some kind of moral imperative to intervene, or should they be allowed to be regular people, too? It seems that humans want it both ways.It seems that humans are saying: \"Don't be a superalien ... except when I and my friends and family are in trouble. Then come save us.\""

"Batman v Superman: Ultimate Edition: If your looking for a quick, cheap thrill then you might not enjoy this film at the time. This movies theatrical version was butchered by WB and in doing so reshaped the story leaving numerous plot holes. So the Ultimate Edition is the full story and the one worth seeing. Watch 'Man of Steel' before seeing this movie. There is much to claw through here, so much so that the audience might easily find themselves exhausted from the overall aggression of the film. However, a lot of the story does work. The action is good, and the emotion feels real most of the time.This film is about Superman trying to become Superman. Trying to help the world, save people, find a place in this world not as an outcast, and yet is looked at has a threat by many. Superman is not from this world, yet He is trying to be human, find a place in this world, be excepted by earths people, and come into his destiny.This film is also about Batman being Batman for 20 years and losing faith in humanity, and fearing Superman, what Superman can do with his powers. Great film, great plot, great visuals. ---Yidioo"
"I didn't see the film in the theaters and just bought the \"Extended Edition \" on Amazon. I never properly saw Man of Steel- i think I rented it and watched it when already exhausted and fell asleep. I saw the mediocre user reviews and horrible reviews from critics of this film.They really have it wrong. This is the very best either Batman or Superman. It has a different take, on things. Much darker then earlier films even darker then the Christopher Nolan Batman films.First of all Christopher Nolan is an Executive Producer. So how bad could it be? I loved Sucker Punch and Zack Snyder was involved with that. So how bad could this be? Hans Zimmer did the music, so how bad could it be?I remember watching the old Superman TV shows and reading the Superman and Batman comics as a little kid and loved them, but i wouldn't call myself a \"fan boy\" of comic universes, like so many younger people today. As an older adult I will admit my favorite TV show of all time was Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but watched it on DVD only after it had finished. I saw the second of the Dark Knight series in the theater, but the other two, I watched on DVD. They were great, but not my favorite films like so many people. i also loved the first couple Superman and Batman films in the older series. Regardless, i was not waiting with baited breath to see Man of Steel or this one.I'm more of a serious film fan, who can watch Stanley Kubrick films over and over and my favorite films in the last twenty years, are Eyes Wide Shut and Intersteller, both of which i've watched multiple times.So, with that said, take it from me, the critics have this film very wrong, just as critics hated 2001: A Space Odyssey when it first came out. This film will have lasting appreciation.Surprised how much I liked Ben Afleck's Batman. it was hard to get into Henry Cavil's scrawnier looking Superman, but it grew on me. Amy Adams was great as Lois Lane, The Gal Gadol Wonder Women was amazing. Lex Luther was terrific, like Nolan's Joker. Jeremy Irons was the best Alfred ever. Holly Hunter and Diane Lane was good too. The movie had bad reviews but made a billion dollars. Hopefully everyone buys the Ultimate Edition and it breaks sales records and the film is re-appreciated. I have no idea what scenes this Ultimate Edition added, but it is pretty perfect. Now I can't wait for Wonder Woman and the Justice League and as soon as I finish writing this am going to watch Man of Steal. I'm into it now!I can only surmise that the bad reviews stem from too much expectations of the rigid fan boy types and the radical changes in tone, we see in this film.Total masterpiece of cinema, but I have a few criticisms. There are a few hollow scenes of typical Idiot cops and authorities getting everything wrong in a cliché type way and it has a few filler scenes of that type and a few moments here and there that felt rushed and cheesy. Maybe not everything restored into the Ultimate Edition should have been. I wish there had been more Kevin Costner scenes."

"The whole entire Batman V Superman movie was great and yes even though it felt slow to the majority of the people who watched it but to me I enjoyed every part and every scene of Batman V Superman and when it got to the fight scenes both batman VS Superman and the Doomsday fight it brought so much drama, intensity, and epic performances. So with that being said I give this movie a good 10/10 because it really did go to my expectations and it brought a powerful performance and a powerful yet epic introduction to the upcoming Justice League."

"When I first wrote a review for this movie a year ago exclaiming my excitement for the film, I had been high off a fresh dose of live-action DC superheroes playing out the beloved comic book stories that I had grown up on. It was all playing out before my eyes and coming to life. After a few months had passed, I began to notice things about the movie that I disliked: little gaps in the story, things that didn't add up, etc. My original rating of a 10 / 10 dropped to an 8 /10. But today it has gone back up to a 10. The extended version of the film not only rectifies the gaps but also silences critics.Many claimed that the movie was too dark or that it just didn't make sense. To those people, I say: \"Pick up a comic book!\" Many of the critics of this particular film were part of the superhero bandwagon that formed when Marvel began its spree of Avengers-related films. In fact, its estimated that over 60% of people who go to see 'superhero' genre films have never picked up a comic book in their life. I would argue that similar numbers could figure to those which view the CW televised DC Universe shows. People complain that DC comics is just too dark but the fact is that these movies are based upon actual comics which are meant to be dark (ex: The Dark Knight Returns, Injustice, etc.). Its like complaining that Game of Thrones (the TV series) sucks because they kill off too many characters. Read the books! Its frustrating to see such a beautiful work of art like Batman V Superman criticized by those ignorant to its universe and its meaning. This movie is in fact a catalyst that opens numerous doorways and leaves true fans in awe of the possibilities for future movies. But regardless of whether or not people choose to educate themselves, this film's DVD/Blu-ray extended version puts the theater release to shame. All of the plot holes and gaps are filled in 30 minutes of extended footage scattered throughout the film. The movie ultimately becomes more complete and people will wish that the movie had shown the full 3 hours of footage in its theatrical debut. As a major DC comics fan, I will of course pick up on things that a comics fan would not, but someone who does not read comics would learn to appreciate this film in its entirety with the extended version. Get your hands on a copy today or find it on Netflix or the internet somewhere!"

"I ignored the bad reviews and watched anyways. This film had a lot to live up to after Civil War was released and I went into this film expecting the worst. It ended up to be the best Superhero film of 2016 to me. One complaint was that this film was more concerned about universe building than telling a great story than Civil War but for me it was the other way around; Civil War felt like a build up to something else and to be honest, I felt that way when I saw the other MCU films. Batman vs Superman however not only had a great story, but it also felt a lot more consistent than Civil War. This film was way more diverse with the cast than the MCU but unlike the MCU, I felt like this film doesn't go overboard with the SJW stuff like the MCU films or The Star Wars Sequel films do. The Visuals were AMAZING, The Score by Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL was AMAZING as well, The Tone is just right as I actually felt for the characters emotionally, The Cinematography kept my eyes glued to the screen, and the script felt really Intelligent and Complex and despite people calling the writing confusing, I was able to piece it together with no problem whatsoever. This film is similar to Empire Strikes back in terms of popularity so over time after the other movies are released, this movie would probably be more popular.This film was way better than I Expected and deserves another chance.

"Its shame to see what critics and marvel fans did to this movie and targeted Zack Snyder for it. I have seen this movie more than 25 times till date. And i enjoy this movie as much as i enjoyed the first time. The fans who have read DC comics, wouldn't be disappointed in this movie. Its dark movie, yes it is. Because the title shows the intense situation at hand. Two superheroes about to rip each other apart for whatever reasons that brought them to this stage. Yes it had to be dark and intense.Only marvel can be stupid enough to show an alien invasion where humans are loosing the battle and the super heroes are cracking jokes while battles as if they are playing ping pong. a person playing Call of Duty game is more serious while playing than the marvel heroes fighting aliens."

"Last week some news came out from somebody online who had claimed to have seen a finished version of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. If you were like me, you've been leery of checking it out because you weren't sure how much might actually be true. Now Zack Snyder has spoken out about the spoiler-filled post, although his response doesn't really clear anything up.In a word, to MTV, he called the post \"hilarious,which might imply that he's saying that it's mostly, if not entirely, untrue. That might be the case, but then again he could have just said it was untrue and he didn't say that. What he did say, however, is that he doesn't like spoilers. While this may seem odd for the director who's most recent trailer appeared to give away the entire movie, Snyder says that's not the case. Even if you've seen the trailer, you can rest easy, as there is much more we have not seen in then finished film. Says Snyder I have the benefit of seeing the movie. It's cool that think it's too much, and I appreciate people not wanting to know, but there's plenty that they don't know. There's a lot of movie that's not in the trailer. In the process of calling the Batman v Superman Reddit review hilarious, Snyder goes on to talk about how he hates it when spoilers come out. The director would much rather that fans see the movie mostly blind. While he understands that some fans may wish to find the answers before hand, he wants his movies to be mysteries going in. If you're, as an audience member, exploring these articles, looking for answers to questions that you have, maybe you're okay with knowing before you go. It's like an individual taste. But like I said, I want people to see the movie without knowing.Spoilers are a topic that mean different things to different people. While most try to avoid them to some degree, the need to solve the mystery is a nearly universal human experience. We have an inclination to want to know the truth, even while also wanting to be surprised. For most of us getting some information is good, but getting all the information is bad, of course, only getting the details that you want can be difficult."
"The theatrical is choppy, poorly edited, hard to follow, with some really good moments mixed in their. The extended is much more fluent and is much easier to follow, it does have a long runtime, which might make it seem a bit dragging on, but if you like long films done right, like Lord of the Rings, you will like this movie as long as you get into the characters and story. Speaking of which, the story starts out perfectly showing Bruce Wayne as a character, and it is very powerful. There are several moments in this movie that are powerful, emotional, and shocking. Characters. Batman is my favorite fictional character of all time, and believe me when I say, Ben Affleck as Batman was perfect, he had the charisma, the anger, and the look of being through some bad stuff Gal Gadot also does perfect as Wonder Woman, but if you want to really see how good she does, go watch the Wonder Woman movie. Henry Call as Superman. I really don't like it when people say Christopher Reeves is better. Don't get me wrong, Reeves does great, but can you imagine him as Superman in this movie? I wouldn't like it. It would be like Adam West playing Batman in The Dark Knight. Henry Cavill does great in this role, I can say everything about him as I said with Ben Affleck. Jesse Eisenberg as Luthor. I thought it was different in a good way. I've heard a criticism for him as being too much like Joker, but is that a bad thing? Joker is my favorite villain, so to see Superman have an enemy that crazy, but still hold the values Luthor needs to be Luthor, I think it is great. The thing I thought this movie was lacking in the first and second acts was humor, at least good humor. If there was more humor, I would've given this movie a ten because it would give a more relaxing feel to the parts that needed it. All in all though, this movie was awesome, it had powerful moments, it was badass, and just plain fun. It had a great story arc and does its job very well."

"*I will be talking about the Ultimate Edition of the film* This was one of the most anticipated CBM of all time. Ever since the arrival and subsequent success of Marvel's The Avengers people have wondered when will DC launch its own cinematic universe, one of the main reasons being the opportunity to finally see titans such as Batman and Superman share the screen together: the ultimate nerd dream. On 2016, the moment finally came for BvS to be released AND.. it performed poorly. Not only did critical reception left a lot to be desired, but fan reactions where surprisingly split after its cinematic debut. People either loved it and called Zack a genius, or hated it and called him a hack. Me, personally, I found myself with middle of the road feelings, for sure, but more leaning towards the negative side with subsequent viewings. The theatrical cut of the film showcased amazing performances, incredible visuals, and action set pieces that seemed like comic book panels come to life, in a good way. However, when it comes to its narrative structure and more technical aspects like editing, the film was seriously flawed. More plot holes than Age of Ultron, questionable character decisions, random editing that lacked cohesion and focus, and forced dramatic moments that lacked any impact because the attempts at character development ranged from limited to nonexistent, especially when it comes to Superman's character. I thought it was a 5/10 movie at best. As such, I was kind of skeptical about the idea of a 30 minute longer version. I say kind of because I know how Zack works. I remember Watchmen being vastly improved with its director's cut, so in a way I was expecting BvS to perform in a similar manner, but I also feared those 30 minutes wold be just there to amplify action and discredit storytelling issues. Oh boy, I'm so glad I was proved wrong. The ultimate cut of the film was infuriating, but not because it was awful, but because it questions the sanity of WB executives and editors and makes you wonder what were they thinking during the editing process. What I got out of the Ultimate Edition was a thought-provoking deconstruction of two very iconic superheroes that gave spotlight to the struggles both of them face when they aren't fighting crime. What I got was an extremely well produced character study on both Batman and Superman in a cynical world, a world dangerously close to our own. We meet Batman as a ruthless, worn out hero that has seen the failure behind his ideals and witnessed some truly horrifying things in his life. Superman, on the other hand, is portrayed as a godlike figure that seeks to do good in the world, but finds himself emotionally conflicted once he realized that every good deed he does leaves behind a trail of destruction (most of it due to Luthor's antics). In my opinion, this is a hugely original approach, one that distances itself from the rest of the competition and delivers a dark, somber, yet relevant superhero movie that understands both characters and gives them real human struggles to deal with. I felt invested in both of them, and hoped that by the end of the film both could find a way to redeem themselves. Their character arcs were very well established during the first two acts of the movie, and by the time we get to the titular climactic battle the emotion behind the jaw-dropping action is intensified. Lex Luthor as a villain was also given more time to develop with this new edition. One of the main criticisms with the original version was the fact that his plan relied too much on conveniences, and the character's mannerisms and mad-scientist attitude was annoying, and that goes without saying his motivations were unclear. Not only do we spend more time understanding his hate for any godlike figure and thus his hatred for Superman, but the added scenes allowed us to witness his entire plan come to fruition. It sells the cold, manipulative, calculating attributes of his comic counterpart. The acting is spot on. Every actor owns his/her role, from Cavill's Superman, to Ben Affleck as Batman, Eisenberg as Luthor, and Gadot as Wonder Woman, whose scenes are brief, but are more than enough to sell the strong and ferocious warrior that she is. Cinematography is stunning, and miles above that of Man of Steel's. And the soundtrack by Zimmer and Junkie XL? Perfect, just perfect. When it comes to flaws, the film still has some of those. The Martha moment, while serving as a pivotal character moment for Batman, felt off in execution, and its understandable that many people got mad at it. If your main complaint about BvS the first time around was its bleak tone and subject matter, this film is still not for you. I understand most were expecting to see the heroes being the most iconic versions of themselves, clashing in an elongated battle and evoking the same feelings The Avengers gave audiences back in 2012. In that sense, the film will remain divisive, but at least I have the comfort of saying that, at the very least, the film is competently made."

"This film was amazing. Ben Affleck was easily the best part of this movie, he brought his a-game as Batman. The chemistry between Affleck & Irons was outstanding. Gal Gadot did a great job as Wonder Woman. The fight between Batman & Superman was awesome. The final fight with Doomsday was outstanding in every way possible. However, there is only one problem with this film and that's Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor. He was sadly missed cast in this role, but then again it's really the fault of Warner Bros. Studios. Overall, this film deliver on almost every level. I highly recommend that you watch the extended version of this film."

"I know I know. I saw it in theaters too, and felt like it could've been so much better. While the Batman element was good, the narrative felt fractured, and the third act was just one long stunt scene. Superman was relegated to a supporting character, and other characters didn't get a chance to shine. And then I chanced on the ultimate cut. Calling it 30 mins of \"extra\" footage is unfair to Zack Snyder because it's exactly these 30 mins that makes the movie a worthy one. What I can say about the theatrical cut is this - It had the blockbuster elements - music, visuals, stunts, CGI. But, it lacked the human elements. The first 20 mins of the movie had it, but not after that. The extended cut in comparison has a flow to the narrative. There are no disjointed scenes, everything flows smoothly, and there's connective tissue. Superman gets to spend some time with his father, and mother. Clark Kent does some investigative journalism. Superman helps the people after the blast. Lois Lane doesn't jump to conclusions, she gets to the bottom of the crime. Lex Luthor apparently had a coherent plan - everything is explained pretty well. Wonder Woman was already good, so there's no change there :) Also, the \"Martha\" scene seems better executed, because it is a few seconds longer, and there's time to breathe it in. So, here's my take on this movie - The theatrical cut was junk. Get the Bluray for ultimate edition, and you shall not be disappointed. I've seen it so many more times now, and it's the definitive cut. It is the movie we deserve. It's a unique take on Batman, and Superman. It's a gritty take on the superhero movie genre, and definitely the best DCEU movie, and the best DC movie since The Dark Knight.P.S. Yes it's dark. We're adults, and we should appreciate mature film making without intentionally silly moments. It attempts to be philosophical, and something deep instead of just trying to make you chuckle."

"This is one of the best superhero movies ever made. Zack Snyder is a magician behind the camera.The reason behind so many complaints is the fact that Warner Bros. marketed this movie as a fight between Batman and Superman. That's not what it is. It's a movie about the origins of the Justice League.The cinematography, the acting and the score are all second to none. This film is phenomenal.P.S: watch the 3 hour extended cut that Snyder intended you to see, not the 2 and a half hour movie that Warner Bros. decided would be better for theaters."

"I don't care what the critics say, this is a very well-done movie. I'll start my review by listing what I like about the movie.1.) Ben Affleck is the best batman to me and it is not close. He pulls off the role of an aging batman extremely well. Also, Zack Snyder's vision of batman is legit. I have always hated batman up until this adaptation of him. Instead of being a conflicted and idealistic batman, this batman is dark, gritty, and 100% a badass. His equipment is decked out with machine guns and he has no aversion to killing people. In fact, he probably kills about 50 criminal by the time this movie is over. The warehouse scene is the coolest batman scene in any movie.2.) The development of a grudge between batman and superman is pulled off flawlessly. It actually makes sense why batman dislikes superman. Then, when they do fight it is about the coolest thing you can expect to see from a superhero film. 3.) I disagree with a lot of people about Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor. In my opinion, he played his role to perfection. 4.) B v S sets up Wonder Woman and Justice League with Gal Gadot's cameo as Wonder Woman and short clips of Aquaman, the Flash, and Cyborg. B v S is one of my favorite superhero films and rewatching it never gets old."

"The theatrical cut of this film is garbage which is why I rated it eight stars instead of nine. The first time I watched this film I didn't like it (not straight out hate but didn't like). Character motivations didn't make any sense, Lex was annoying as s***, editing was sloppy, and it was overly dark and broody for an action superhero movie. A year + a half, five Marvel films, a ton of bad reviews and a Justice League later a thought popped into my head: \"what if I watched BVS again\". This time I didn't have trailers ruining the best moments, I only vaguely remembered the film, and I was conditioned to look at it negatively but something unexpected happened: I actually loved it. Superman was just a normal person that tried to make a difference cause he could that others imposed their own beliefs on. Lex Luthor was a genius that couldn't stand his powerlessness compared to Superman or more accurately a super being. As Alfred said \"The fever, the rage, the feeling of powerlessness that turns good men... cruel\" and you see the same thought process in Batman. Batman, just like Lex Luthor feels powerless in the midst of a god-being and just like Lex he attempts to destroy him so he can get his sense of power back but unlike Lex, Batman learns something. I what is one of the corniest lines of the movie Superman says, \"Martha\" when he knows he can't win against Batman in a late desperate attempt to save his mother. Not only does this name connect with Bruce Wayne but it also shows what really matters to a man of steel: it isn't power, it isn't fame or anything else, it is his Mother and on a broader scale it is people. Lex (who doesn't care about people at all) knows he doesn't have the power so he creates something from his blood and the remains of Zod: A Doomsday for Superman. Not only does this film have depth but it also doesn't always explain it to you which is rare in a blockbuster action superhero flick normally cater to semi-comic book fans and people that want to shove popcorn in their mouths. This film rewards you for really noticing the details while still having massive explosions. One of my favorites is how Lex has all of Batman's branded killed which is why he isn't afraid of the branding at the end or Grandma's Peach Tea as a way of scaring the s*** out of someone. Of course, this film isn't perfect and I do have personal dislikes. The Batman V Superman fight was slow and pretty boring especially after watching such an amazing fight in Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 2 (If you haven't watched the animated Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 1 and 2 you are sorely missing out on something fantastic). Also, the addition of Wonder Woman who pretty much steals a hacker thing, gives it back and then suits up and fights against a giant monster thing. Not to say I don't like Wonder Woman (She is one of my favorite Superheroes of all time who showed not only can woman kick a** but they also don't need to be ashamed of their sexuality or gender) but she wasn't really that helpful to the plot and just brought in to expand the universe which was well done through Lex's superhuman hunting files. Also, the post-apocalyptic scene that was just a dream could have been cut but nothing is perfect except movies like Citizen Kane which isn't a lot of fun to watch cause it is too perfect. So to summarize, the theatrical cut is bad, the ultimate cut is Amazing and the other cut is meh. Please give it a second chance because it deserves it and save a good director from losing grace because of something he didn't do."
"I really liked it, don't know what all the hate is about. I'm actually a Marvel fan from when I was 7 or so, but Superman and Batman together in 1 movie? Just great. And personally I like Ben Affleck even better than Christian Bale as Batman. So just watch and enjoy, I know I did!"

"That's right. We have been waiting for these two heroes to finally meet and fight against each other. This movie is so good in both plot and special effects.Henry Cavill and Ben Affleck have performed well in their acting stages. They are the best superhero actors and they have filmed their fighting scenes very well. The movie starts to show the conflict between the lives of the heroes and now they have blamed each other for it. This movie is amazing and sets up a good plot for Dawn Justice."

"Actually...I didn't know what to expect. When you see Wonder Woman, you know it will be off of Wonder Woman and off of a Wonder Woman story, but with Batman V Superman, I was like, \"hmmmm, so who is this about?\" It was pretty obvious that it would feature many characters, but I thought the introduction to Batman was amazing. Ben Affleck nailed the part, not only as Batman but also as Bruce Wayne. He is my Batman. Henry Cavill continued to be super as the Man of Steel. And he is my Super - Man. A dark story? Yes, without a doubt. Could it have had a few more jokes? Sure. But not all movies or stories need to have jokes when certain events are serious. I really hope people can see this review and take another look at the movie, because, I loved it. I really hope the ratings can go up, eventually. And P.S, this movie is the perfect set up to Justice League."

"This film is crucial to the extended universe that DC is trying to build, but it feels highly derivative of better stories and continues to demonstrate the misuse of the iconic characters mentioned in the title. Plus Jesse Eisenberg feels wildly mis-casted."

"I'll start by making it clear I have only ever seen the Ultimate Edition. I'm aware of what was cut out for the theatrical release, so I will concede up front that most of the criticisms about pacing, editing, and missing bits of plot at release were merited.With that caveat out of the way, I must reiterate that this was bar-none the boldest superhero movie I have ever seen. To me, it was arguably the best as well, though \"best\" shouldn't be taken to mean \"most enjoyable.\" That honor easily goes to \"Thor: Ragnarok.\" What makes BvS stand out among other films in the genre is that it takes two characters who have been done to death since the 1970s and brings them up to date. I recently tried to watch \"Superman: The Movie\" for the first time in a number of years, and while it was still good and Reeves will always be iconic, I just couldn't take it seriously. I'll put it this way: If the story in BvS was \"stupid\" in your view but Superman turning back time by spinning the earth backward on its axis didn't seem like one of the dumbest things you have ever seen -in any movie from any genre- to the extent that it outright ruins the movie for you, then your opinion about BvS isn't worth much. Nostalgic bias was always going to be a problem for this movie, and the way people reacted to and reviewed \"Man of Steel\" was telling in this regard.That brings me to Zack Snyder's take on Superman. You know, that guy whose status as the first extraterrestrial ever encountered by humanity was a total non-issue in the old movies. Apparently, Snyder has a similar view to my own in that his take on the Man of Steel makes his being an alien a core piece of his identity. He may look like any other (absurdly attractive) person, but he knows what he is, and that makes him perpetually uncertain of where he fits in this world. He is essentially good and really does care about people, but he struggles to truly empathize with the likes of us. To be human is to be frail, and that is not something he can easily relate to. This is the root of his conflict with Batman.Just as Clark struggles to genuinely relate to most people, Snyder's Batman either refuses to or otherwise just can't relate to Superman. He doesn't see him as anything but a threat regardless of Superman's clear good intentions. Remember, a small group of Kryptonians were able to bring humanity to the brink of extinction in less than a day, and Bruce Wayne is nothing if not a realist. He didn't know the guy from Kansas. He only knew the god from another world.While Batman's anger toward and fear of Superman are readily apparent from the start, Superman's inability to imagine things from Bruce Wayne's perspective only becomes truly apparent during their first real interaction. This reminded me of the animated version of the \"world's finest\" storyline, where Superman judges Batman harshly for using fear tactics and threats of violence (also, actual violence) to get the job done. Superman wasn't willing to consider what it would take for a human man to fight criminals and save innocents, or what that life would do to him over time. Just as Batman didn't see the guy from Kansas, Superman didn't see the man who lives his life trapped in one brutal, unthinkably traumatic moment (this was beautifully conveyed during the film's opening moments), and had spent his whole adult life bearing witness to humanity at its absolute worst.The conflict between these two characters is as old as human history. They want the same things, but they can't understand one another. So they fight. And what a fight it was.Watching a fight between, say, Captain America and Iron Man was, to me, more frustrating than anything because each understood the other's perspective perfectly. The fight between Batman and Superman in BvS was genuinely gut-wrenching, as intended, because they would have understood one another if either had tried. The whole sequence hilighted Batman's tactical prowess and ability to control a situation. Maybe the most badass thing about the fight was that it ended exactly where Batman planned. That brings me to the big elephant in the room named \"Martha.\"I can't recall exactly which YouTuber put it this way, but if you thought the \"save Martha\" exchange was about their mothers having the same name, you had your brain turned off. The brain-on people have explained this to death, but it bears repeating. This was the moment when Superman became humanized to Batman. He was about to die, and his only concern was for his adoptive human mother. He still believed that the man about to take his life would do the right thing. Even with the cowl on, there was no mistaking the look on Batman's face. It was the look of shame, guilt, and sudden uncertainty that says \"What am I doing?\" Turns out even the most brutal, angry version of Bruce Wayne is better than Tony Stark at knowing right from wrong. At knowing that he had gone too far.From there, the third act was a series of truly impressive (albeit mostly CGI) fight sequences, beginning with what I regard as the undisputed champion of Batman fights. Nothing in the Nolan movies (and especially nothing in the Burton movies) even came close. Go ahead, try to convince yourself that Batman and Bane taking turns punching one another in the face until Bane's mask broke was a good fight sequence. No, this was a fight straight out of \"Arkham Knight,\" and it was glorious. The battle against Doomsday really was one for the books. From the moment Wonder Woman arrived accompanied by the intense sounds of Tina Guo's electric cello to Superman's tragic, heroic death at the hands of Doomsday, I was glued to the screen. Sure, the mere presence of Doomsday spoiled the end to a degree, but watching the Man of Steel laboring to carry that kryptonite spear towards certain death was no less impactful. A brief word on Jesse Eisenberg's take on Lex Luthor. At least one other reviewer on this site already said it best when they pointed out that this was his origin story. If you consider his scheme objectively, he is actually one of the more formidable incarnations of the character. If we're lucky, we'll eventually get to see a Snyder Cut of \"Justice League\" and find out where this story was actually meant to go. For the record, Joss Whedon and Danny Elfman both should have said \"no\" to taking a dump on someone else's art."
"BATMAN V SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE brings a fantastic surprise to a smash-hit team-up with one of the worlds most beloved DC Comics' icons of all time. The movie delivers spectacular casting, and fantastic acting with different characters having their shine in each scenes.The story follows Clark Kent/Superman who becomes a threat, after the destruction in Metropolis in Man Of Steel.(2013). Batman/Bruce Wayne sees him as a threat and begins his war on Superman.The movie brings spectacular storytelling, it tells the complications of human against alien who are on the same side, and the first meeting of Batman and Superman. The story of Bruce Wayne, with his many years of The Caped Crusader, sends him on a spiral of \"out of control\", sheer anger, and builds tension to wanting to defeat the Man of Steel. Snyder has fantastically gave this storytelling an exciting nod to the comics.Lex Luthor, played by Jesse Einsberg, delivers a very interesting performance, but very differently by him showing is his \"origin\" before he becomes a bald foe to the Man of Steel. He shows that his love of \"god vs man\" terrorises mankind when he ultimately creates Doomsday, and Batman realises Superman's inner heroism.It packs so many great \"out of nowhere\" excitement, including a first-look of the fearful Wonder Woman a.k.a. Diana Prince, played by Gal Gadot, and a fresh-new glimpse of the superhero DC canon: The Justice League.WATCH THIS MOVIE! The critics are out of their mind. It's a fun-packed action adventure which still keeps the movie enjoyable until it's final minutes of the movie. It's a FANTASTIC MOVIE! BEN AFFLECK AS BATMAN... is Incredible!A 10/10 overall!"
"I want to go on record as saying that this is a truly thrilling cinematic experience in so many ways. If pressed, I guess I could acknowledge that there were a couple ... let's say \"clumsy\" moments. And in a film that runs to three hours, that hardly seems like a significant issue, certainly not enough to rate it with fewer than 9 stars.This film has everything. There is dramatic tension right from the start. There is a magnificent story arc that picks up quite seamlessly from 'Man of Steel' and propels the viewer not only into the life of Clark Kent/Superman but also of Bruce Wayne/Batman.The villain is no mere cartoon of a villain; he is truly thoroughly (and apparently irrevocably) diabolical. He is a psychopath, and you wish for his death over and over and over. You want Superman to reduce him to ash with the power of his eyes.I have read a number of viewers' reviews, and it seems that the people who disliked the film / gave it a low rating had rather unfair and unrealistic expectations of it. That is, their own prejudices about how the plot could/should unfold or what the character development could/should be, etc. ruined the film for them. And that is a shame.My thought is: I settle into my seat, wait for the lights to dim, and then I wait to be transported by the film. I accept it, lock, stock, and barrel.As another reviewer remarked, I love how the film begins from the point of view of Bruce Wayne as he is among people on the ground who have fallen victim to the attack of Zod and the other Kryptonians.Why would Bruce Wayne not like Superman? Why would the good people of Earth hurl insults at Superman and burn him in effigy (on the news)? Because the good people of Earth just got catapulted into a new reality in which there are not only extraterrestrial beings (surprise!) but they are also superman! And a group of them are hell-bent on destroying humankind and taking the planet for themselves.It is difficult to see Superman as separate from the whole Kryptonian Krew.It seems that many moviegoers forgot that Bruce Wayne is also human. Sure, he's a hero, but he is flawed.. Just like the rest of us. He is a vigilante, after all.He has let his vigilantism get the better of him. HE is actually the one working outside the boundaries of the law, not Superman. It is the clear head of Alfred that shows us that he has gone into a rather dark place, that he has not seen what is really going on (in Luthor's scheme), and so he chooses to embark on his own scheme scheme to take out the alien invader. He is (allegedly) thinking of the future: if he wipes out the all-powerful alien, then it can't turn on humankind in the future. At least, he convinces himself of that.A philosophical question is raised in the film: should Clark Kent have remained a simple man from Kansas and never have become the Superman? Should he just let people die and let calamities happen? The question is answered for us in the character of Diana Prince/Wonder Woman. She withdrew from mankind (her exact words) and just sat around watching. Watching while people died horrible deaths all around her. So, should Superman have done the same? Do these special beings, these 'metahumans', have some kind of moral imperative to intervene, or should they be allowed to be regular people, too? It seems that humans want it both ways.It seems that humans are saying: \"Don't be a superalien ... except when I and my friends and family are in trouble. Then come save us.\""

"Batman v Superman: Ultimate Edition: If your looking for a quick, cheap thrill then you might not enjoy this film at the time. This movies theatrical version was butchered by WB and in doing so reshaped the story leaving numerous plot holes. So the Ultimate Edition is the full story and the one worth seeing. Watch 'Man of Steel' before seeing this movie. There is much to claw through here, so much so that the audience might easily find themselves exhausted from the overall aggression of the film. However, a lot of the story does work. The action is good, and the emotion feels real most of the time.This film is about Superman trying to become Superman. Trying to help the world, save people, find a place in this world not as an outcast, and yet is looked at has a threat by many. Superman is not from this world, yet He is trying to be human, find a place in this world, be excepted by earths people, and come into his destiny.This film is also about Batman being Batman for 20 years and losing faith in humanity, and fearing Superman, what Superman can do with his powers. Great film, great plot, great visuals. ---Yidioo"
"I didn't see the film in the theaters and just bought the \"Extended Edition \" on Amazon. I never properly saw Man of Steel- i think I rented it and watched it when already exhausted and fell asleep. I saw the mediocre user reviews and horrible reviews from critics of this film.They really have it wrong. This is the very best either Batman or Superman. It has a different take, on things. Much darker then earlier films even darker then the Christopher Nolan Batman films.First of all Christopher Nolan is an Executive Producer. So how bad could it be? I loved Sucker Punch and Zack Snyder was involved with that. So how bad could this be? Hans Zimmer did the music, so how bad could it be?I remember watching the old Superman TV shows and reading the Superman and Batman comics as a little kid and loved them, but i wouldn't call myself a \"fan boy\" of comic universes, like so many younger people today. As an older adult I will admit my favorite TV show of all time was Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but watched it on DVD only after it had finished. I saw the second of the Dark Knight series in the theater, but the other two, I watched on DVD. They were great, but not my favorite films like so many people. i also loved the first couple Superman and Batman films in the older series. Regardless, i was not waiting with baited breath to see Man of Steel or this one.I'm more of a serious film fan, who can watch Stanley Kubrick films over and over and my favorite films in the last twenty years, are Eyes Wide Shut and Intersteller, both of which i've watched multiple times.So, with that said, take it from me, the critics have this film very wrong, just as critics hated 2001: A Space Odyssey when it first came out. This film will have lasting appreciation.Surprised how much I liked Ben Afleck's Batman. it was hard to get into Henry Cavil's scrawnier looking Superman, but it grew on me. Amy Adams was great as Lois Lane, The Gal Gadol Wonder Women was amazing. Lex Luther was terrific, like Nolan's Joker. Jeremy Irons was the best Alfred ever. Holly Hunter and Diane Lane was good too. The movie had bad reviews but made a billion dollars. Hopefully everyone buys the Ultimate Edition and it breaks sales records and the film is re-appreciated. I have no idea what scenes this Ultimate Edition added, but it is pretty perfect. Now I can't wait for Wonder Woman and the Justice League and as soon as I finish writing this am going to watch Man of Steal. I'm into it now!I can only surmise that the bad reviews stem from too much expectations of the rigid fan boy types and the radical changes in tone, we see in this film.Total masterpiece of cinema, but I have a few criticisms. There are a few hollow scenes of typical Idiot cops and authorities getting everything wrong in a cliché type way and it has a few filler scenes of that type and a few moments here and there that felt rushed and cheesy. Maybe not everything restored into the Ultimate Edition should have been. I wish there had been more Kevin Costner scenes."

"The whole entire Batman V Superman movie was great and yes even though it felt slow to the majority of the people who watched it but to me I enjoyed every part and every scene of Batman V Superman and when it got to the fight scenes both batman VS Superman and the Doomsday fight it brought so much drama, intensity, and epic performances. So with that being said I give this movie a good 10/10 because it really did go to my expectations and it brought a powerful performance and a powerful yet epic introduction to the upcoming Justice League."

"When I first wrote a review for this movie a year ago exclaiming my excitement for the film, I had been high off a fresh dose of live-action DC superheroes playing out the beloved comic book stories that I had grown up on. It was all playing out before my eyes and coming to life. After a few months had passed, I began to notice things about the movie that I disliked: little gaps in the story, things that didn't add up, etc. My original rating of a 10 / 10 dropped to an 8 /10. But today it has gone back up to a 10. The extended version of the film not only rectifies the gaps but also silences critics.Many claimed that the movie was too dark or that it just didn't make sense. To those people, I say: \"Pick up a comic book!\" Many of the critics of this particular film were part of the superhero bandwagon that formed when Marvel began its spree of Avengers-related films. In fact, its estimated that over 60% of people who go to see 'superhero' genre films have never picked up a comic book in their life. I would argue that similar numbers could figure to those which view the CW televised DC Universe shows. People complain that DC comics is just too dark but the fact is that these movies are based upon actual comics which are meant to be dark (ex: The Dark Knight Returns, Injustice, etc.). Its like complaining that Game of Thrones (the TV series) sucks because they kill off too many characters. Read the books! Its frustrating to see such a beautiful work of art like Batman V Superman criticized by those ignorant to its universe and its meaning. This movie is in fact a catalyst that opens numerous doorways and leaves true fans in awe of the possibilities for future movies. But regardless of whether or not people choose to educate themselves, this film's DVD/Blu-ray extended version puts the theater release to shame. All of the plot holes and gaps are filled in 30 minutes of extended footage scattered throughout the film. The movie ultimately becomes more complete and people will wish that the movie had shown the full 3 hours of footage in its theatrical debut. As a major DC comics fan, I will of course pick up on things that a comics fan would not, but someone who does not read comics would learn to appreciate this film in its entirety with the extended version. Get your hands on a copy today or find it on Netflix or the internet somewhere!"

"I ignored the bad reviews and watched anyways. This film had a lot to live up to after Civil War was released and I went into this film expecting the worst. It ended up to be the best Superhero film of 2016 to me. One complaint was that this film was more concerned about universe building than telling a great story than Civil War but for me it was the other way around; Civil War felt like a build up to something else and to be honest, I felt that way when I saw the other MCU films. Batman vs Superman however not only had a great story, but it also felt a lot more consistent than Civil War. This film was way more diverse with the cast than the MCU but unlike the MCU, I felt like this film doesn't go overboard with the SJW stuff like the MCU films or The Star Wars Sequel films do. The Visuals were AMAZING, The Score by Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL was AMAZING as well, The Tone is just right as I actually felt for the characters emotionally, The Cinematography kept my eyes glued to the screen, and the script felt really Intelligent and Complex and despite people calling the writing confusing, I was able to piece it together with no problem whatsoever. This film is similar to Empire Strikes back in terms of popularity so over time after the other movies are released, this movie would probably be more popular.This film was way better than I Expected and deserves another chance.

"Its shame to see what critics and marvel fans did to this movie and targeted Zack Snyder for it. I have seen this movie more than 25 times till date. And i enjoy this movie as much as i enjoyed the first time. The fans who have read DC comics, wouldn't be disappointed in this movie. Its dark movie, yes it is. Because the title shows the intense situation at hand. Two superheroes about to rip each other apart for whatever reasons that brought them to this stage. Yes it had to be dark and intense.Only marvel can be stupid enough to show an alien invasion where humans are loosing the battle and the super heroes are cracking jokes while battles as if they are playing ping pong. a person playing Call of Duty game is more serious while playing than the marvel heroes fighting aliens."

"Last week some news came out from somebody online who had claimed to have seen a finished version of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. If you were like me, you've been leery of checking it out because you weren't sure how much might actually be true. Now Zack Snyder has spoken out about the spoiler-filled post, although his response doesn't really clear anything up.In a word, to MTV, he called the post \"hilarious,which might imply that he's saying that it's mostly, if not entirely, untrue. That might be the case, but then again he could have just said it was untrue and he didn't say that. What he did say, however, is that he doesn't like spoilers. While this may seem odd for the director who's most recent trailer appeared to give away the entire movie, Snyder says that's not the case. Even if you've seen the trailer, you can rest easy, as there is much more we have not seen in then finished film. Says Snyder I have the benefit of seeing the movie. It's cool that think it's too much, and I appreciate people not wanting to know, but there's plenty that they don't know. There's a lot of movie that's not in the trailer. In the process of calling the Batman v Superman Reddit review hilarious, Snyder goes on to talk about how he hates it when spoilers come out. The director would much rather that fans see the movie mostly blind. While he understands that some fans may wish to find the answers before hand, he wants his movies to be mysteries going in. If you're, as an audience member, exploring these articles, looking for answers to questions that you have, maybe you're okay with knowing before you go. It's like an individual taste. But like I said, I want people to see the movie without knowing.Spoilers are a topic that mean different things to different people. While most try to avoid them to some degree, the need to solve the mystery is a nearly universal human experience. We have an inclination to want to know the truth, even while also wanting to be surprised. For most of us getting some information is good, but getting all the information is bad, of course, only getting the details that you want can be difficult."
"The theatrical is choppy, poorly edited, hard to follow, with some really good moments mixed in their. The extended is much more fluent and is much easier to follow, it does have a long runtime, which might make it seem a bit dragging on, but if you like long films done right, like Lord of the Rings, you will like this movie as long as you get into the characters and story. Speaking of which, the story starts out perfectly showing Bruce Wayne as a character, and it is very powerful. There are several moments in this movie that are powerful, emotional, and shocking. Characters. Batman is my favorite fictional character of all time, and believe me when I say, Ben Affleck as Batman was perfect, he had the charisma, the anger, and the look of being through some bad stuff Gal Gadot also does perfect as Wonder Woman, but if you want to really see how good she does, go watch the Wonder Woman movie. Henry Call as Superman. I really don't like it when people say Christopher Reeves is better. Don't get me wrong, Reeves does great, but can you imagine him as Superman in this movie? I wouldn't like it. It would be like Adam West playing Batman in The Dark Knight. Henry Cavill does great in this role, I can say everything about him as I said with Ben Affleck. Jesse Eisenberg as Luthor. I thought it was different in a good way. I've heard a criticism for him as being too much like Joker, but is that a bad thing? Joker is my favorite villain, so to see Superman have an enemy that crazy, but still hold the values Luthor needs to be Luthor, I think it is great. The thing I thought this movie was lacking in the first and second acts was humor, at least good humor. If there was more humor, I would've given this movie a ten because it would give a more relaxing feel to the parts that needed it. All in all though, this movie was awesome, it had powerful moments, it was badass, and just plain fun. It had a great story arc and does its job very well."

"*I will be talking about the Ultimate Edition of the film* This was one of the most anticipated CBM of all time. Ever since the arrival and subsequent success of Marvel's The Avengers people have wondered when will DC launch its own cinematic universe, one of the main reasons being the opportunity to finally see titans such as Batman and Superman share the screen together: the ultimate nerd dream. On 2016, the moment finally came for BvS to be released AND.. it performed poorly. Not only did critical reception left a lot to be desired, but fan reactions where surprisingly split after its cinematic debut. People either loved it and called Zack a genius, or hated it and called him a hack. Me, personally, I found myself with middle of the road feelings, for sure, but more leaning towards the negative side with subsequent viewings. The theatrical cut of the film showcased amazing performances, incredible visuals, and action set pieces that seemed like comic book panels come to life, in a good way. However, when it comes to its narrative structure and more technical aspects like editing, the film was seriously flawed. More plot holes than Age of Ultron, questionable character decisions, random editing that lacked cohesion and focus, and forced dramatic moments that lacked any impact because the attempts at character development ranged from limited to nonexistent, especially when it comes to Superman's character. I thought it was a 5/10 movie at best. As such, I was kind of skeptical about the idea of a 30 minute longer version. I say kind of because I know how Zack works. I remember Watchmen being vastly improved with its director's cut, so in a way I was expecting BvS to perform in a similar manner, but I also feared those 30 minutes wold be just there to amplify action and discredit storytelling issues. Oh boy, I'm so glad I was proved wrong. The ultimate cut of the film was infuriating, but not because it was awful, but because it questions the sanity of WB executives and editors and makes you wonder what were they thinking during the editing process. What I got out of the Ultimate Edition was a thought-provoking deconstruction of two very iconic superheroes that gave spotlight to the struggles both of them face when they aren't fighting crime. What I got was an extremely well produced character study on both Batman and Superman in a cynical world, a world dangerously close to our own. We meet Batman as a ruthless, worn out hero that has seen the failure behind his ideals and witnessed some truly horrifying things in his life. Superman, on the other hand, is portrayed as a godlike figure that seeks to do good in the world, but finds himself emotionally conflicted once he realized that every good deed he does leaves behind a trail of destruction (most of it due to Luthor's antics). In my opinion, this is a hugely original approach, one that distances itself from the rest of the competition and delivers a dark, somber, yet relevant superhero movie that understands both characters and gives them real human struggles to deal with. I felt invested in both of them, and hoped that by the end of the film both could find a way to redeem themselves. Their character arcs were very well established during the first two acts of the movie, and by the time we get to the titular climactic battle the emotion behind the jaw-dropping action is intensified. Lex Luthor as a villain was also given more time to develop with this new edition. One of the main criticisms with the original version was the fact that his plan relied too much on conveniences, and the character's mannerisms and mad-scientist attitude was annoying, and that goes without saying his motivations were unclear. Not only do we spend more time understanding his hate for any godlike figure and thus his hatred for Superman, but the added scenes allowed us to witness his entire plan come to fruition. It sells the cold, manipulative, calculating attributes of his comic counterpart. The acting is spot on. Every actor owns his/her role, from Cavill's Superman, to Ben Affleck as Batman, Eisenberg as Luthor, and Gadot as Wonder Woman, whose scenes are brief, but are more than enough to sell the strong and ferocious warrior that she is. Cinematography is stunning, and miles above that of Man of Steel's. And the soundtrack by Zimmer and Junkie XL? Perfect, just perfect. When it comes to flaws, the film still has some of those. The Martha moment, while serving as a pivotal character moment for Batman, felt off in execution, and its understandable that many people got mad at it. If your main complaint about BvS the first time around was its bleak tone and subject matter, this film is still not for you. I understand most were expecting to see the heroes being the most iconic versions of themselves, clashing in an elongated battle and evoking the same feelings The Avengers gave audiences back in 2012. In that sense, the film will remain divisive, but at least I have the comfort of saying that, at the very least, the film is competently made."

"This film was amazing. Ben Affleck was easily the best part of this movie, he brought his a-game as Batman. The chemistry between Affleck & Irons was outstanding. Gal Gadot did a great job as Wonder Woman. The fight between Batman & Superman was awesome. The final fight with Doomsday was outstanding in every way possible. However, there is only one problem with this film and that's Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor. He was sadly missed cast in this role, but then again it's really the fault of Warner Bros. Studios. Overall, this film deliver on almost every level. I highly recommend that you watch the extended version of this film."

"I know I know. I saw it in theaters too, and felt like it could've been so much better. While the Batman element was good, the narrative felt fractured, and the third act was just one long stunt scene. Superman was relegated to a supporting character, and other characters didn't get a chance to shine. And then I chanced on the ultimate cut. Calling it 30 mins of \"extra\" footage is unfair to Zack Snyder because it's exactly these 30 mins that makes the movie a worthy one. What I can say about the theatrical cut is this - It had the blockbuster elements - music, visuals, stunts, CGI. But, it lacked the human elements. The first 20 mins of the movie had it, but not after that. The extended cut in comparison has a flow to the narrative. There are no disjointed scenes, everything flows smoothly, and there's connective tissue. Superman gets to spend some time with his father, and mother. Clark Kent does some investigative journalism. Superman helps the people after the blast. Lois Lane doesn't jump to conclusions, she gets to the bottom of the crime. Lex Luthor apparently had a coherent plan - everything is explained pretty well. Wonder Woman was already good, so there's no change there :) Also, the \"Martha\" scene seems better executed, because it is a few seconds longer, and there's time to breathe it in. So, here's my take on this movie - The theatrical cut was junk. Get the Bluray for ultimate edition, and you shall not be disappointed. I've seen it so many more times now, and it's the definitive cut. It is the movie we deserve. It's a unique take on Batman, and Superman. It's a gritty take on the superhero movie genre, and definitely the best DCEU movie, and the best DC movie since The Dark Knight.P.S. Yes it's dark. We're adults, and we should appreciate mature film making without intentionally silly moments. It attempts to be philosophical, and something deep instead of just trying to make you chuckle."

"This is one of the best superhero movies ever made. Zack Snyder is a magician behind the camera.The reason behind so many complaints is the fact that Warner Bros. marketed this movie as a fight between Batman and Superman. That's not what it is. It's a movie about the origins of the Justice League.The cinematography, the acting and the score are all second to none. This film is phenomenal.P.S: watch the 3 hour extended cut that Snyder intended you to see, not the 2 and a half hour movie that Warner Bros. decided would be better for theaters."

"I don't care what the critics say, this is a very well-done movie. I'll start my review by listing what I like about the movie.1.) Ben Affleck is the best batman to me and it is not close. He pulls off the role of an aging batman extremely well. Also, Zack Snyder's vision of batman is legit. I have always hated batman up until this adaptation of him. Instead of being a conflicted and idealistic batman, this batman is dark, gritty, and 100% a badass. His equipment is decked out with machine guns and he has no aversion to killing people. In fact, he probably kills about 50 criminal by the time this movie is over. The warehouse scene is the coolest batman scene in any movie.2.) The development of a grudge between batman and superman is pulled off flawlessly. It actually makes sense why batman dislikes superman. Then, when they do fight it is about the coolest thing you can expect to see from a superhero film. 3.) I disagree with a lot of people about Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor. In my opinion, he played his role to perfection. 4.) B v S sets up Wonder Woman and Justice League with Gal Gadot's cameo as Wonder Woman and short clips of Aquaman, the Flash, and Cyborg. B v S is one of my favorite superhero films and rewatching it never gets old."

"The theatrical cut of this film is garbage which is why I rated it eight stars instead of nine. The first time I watched this film I didn't like it (not straight out hate but didn't like). Character motivations didn't make any sense, Lex was annoying as s***, editing was sloppy, and it was overly dark and broody for an action superhero movie. A year + a half, five Marvel films, a ton of bad reviews and a Justice League later a thought popped into my head: \"what if I watched BVS again\". This time I didn't have trailers ruining the best moments, I only vaguely remembered the film, and I was conditioned to look at it negatively but something unexpected happened: I actually loved it. Superman was just a normal person that tried to make a difference cause he could that others imposed their own beliefs on. Lex Luthor was a genius that couldn't stand his powerlessness compared to Superman or more accurately a super being. As Alfred said \"The fever, the rage, the feeling of powerlessness that turns good men... cruel\" and you see the same thought process in Batman. Batman, just like Lex Luthor feels powerless in the midst of a god-being and just like Lex he attempts to destroy him so he can get his sense of power back but unlike Lex, Batman learns something. I what is one of the corniest lines of the movie Superman says, \"Martha\" when he knows he can't win against Batman in a late desperate attempt to save his mother. Not only does this name connect with Bruce Wayne but it also shows what really matters to a man of steel: it isn't power, it isn't fame or anything else, it is his Mother and on a broader scale it is people. Lex (who doesn't care about people at all) knows he doesn't have the power so he creates something from his blood and the remains of Zod: A Doomsday for Superman. Not only does this film have depth but it also doesn't always explain it to you which is rare in a blockbuster action superhero flick normally cater to semi-comic book fans and people that want to shove popcorn in their mouths. This film rewards you for really noticing the details while still having massive explosions. One of my favorites is how Lex has all of Batman's branded killed which is why he isn't afraid of the branding at the end or Grandma's Peach Tea as a way of scaring the s*** out of someone. Of course, this film isn't perfect and I do have personal dislikes. The Batman V Superman fight was slow and pretty boring especially after watching such an amazing fight in Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 2 (If you haven't watched the animated Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 1 and 2 you are sorely missing out on something fantastic). Also, the addition of Wonder Woman who pretty much steals a hacker thing, gives it back and then suits up and fights against a giant monster thing. Not to say I don't like Wonder Woman (She is one of my favorite Superheroes of all time who showed not only can woman kick a** but they also don't need to be ashamed of their sexuality or gender) but she wasn't really that helpful to the plot and just brought in to expand the universe which was well done through Lex's superhuman hunting files. Also, the post-apocalyptic scene that was just a dream could have been cut but nothing is perfect except movies like Citizen Kane which isn't a lot of fun to watch cause it is too perfect. So to summarize, the theatrical cut is bad, the ultimate cut is Amazing and the other cut is meh. Please give it a second chance because it deserves it and save a good director from losing grace because of something he didn't do."
"I really liked it, don't know what all the hate is about. I'm actually a Marvel fan from when I was 7 or so, but Superman and Batman together in 1 movie? Just great. And personally I like Ben Affleck even better than Christian Bale as Batman. So just watch and enjoy, I know I did!"

"That's right. We have been waiting for these two heroes to finally meet and fight against each other. This movie is so good in both plot and special effects.Henry Cavill and Ben Affleck have performed well in their acting stages. They are the best superhero actors and they have filmed their fighting scenes very well. The movie starts to show the conflict between the lives of the heroes and now they have blamed each other for it. This movie is amazing and sets up a good plot for Dawn Justice."

"Actually...I didn't know what to expect. When you see Wonder Woman, you know it will be off of Wonder Woman and off of a Wonder Woman story, but with Batman V Superman, I was like, \"hmmmm, so who is this about?\" It was pretty obvious that it would feature many characters, but I thought the introduction to Batman was amazing. Ben Affleck nailed the part, not only as Batman but also as Bruce Wayne. He is my Batman. Henry Cavill continued to be super as the Man of Steel. And he is my Super - Man. A dark story? Yes, without a doubt. Could it have had a few more jokes? Sure. But not all movies or stories need to have jokes when certain events are serious. I really hope people can see this review and take another look at the movie, because, I loved it. I really hope the ratings can go up, eventually. And P.S, this movie is the perfect set up to Justice League."

"I'll start by making it clear I have only ever seen the Ultimate Edition. I'm aware of what was cut out for the theatrical release, so I will concede up front that most of the criticisms about pacing, editing, and missing bits of plot at release were merited.With that caveat out of the way, I must reiterate that this was bar-none the boldest superhero movie I have ever seen. To me, it was arguably the best as well, though \"best\" shouldn't be taken to mean \"most enjoyable.\" That honor easily goes to \"Thor: Ragnarok.\" What makes BvS stand out among other films in the genre is that it takes two characters who have been done to death since the 1970s and brings them up to date. I recently tried to watch \"Superman: The Movie\" for the first time in a number of years, and while it was still good and Reeves will always be iconic, I just couldn't take it seriously. I'll put it this way: If the story in BvS was \"stupid\" in your view but Superman turning back time by spinning the earth backward on its axis didn't seem like one of the dumbest things you have ever seen -in any movie from any genre- to the extent that it outright ruins the movie for you, then your opinion about BvS isn't worth much. Nostalgic bias was always going to be a problem for this movie, and the way people reacted to and reviewed \"Man of Steel\" was telling in this regard.That brings me to Zack Snyder's take on Superman. You know, that guy whose status as the first extraterrestrial ever encountered by humanity was a total non-issue in the old movies. Apparently, Snyder has a similar view to my own in that his take on the Man of Steel makes his being an alien a core piece of his identity. He may look like any other (absurdly attractive) person, but he knows what he is, and that makes him perpetually uncertain of where he fits in this world. He is essentially good and really does care about people, but he struggles to truly empathize with the likes of us. To be human is to be frail, and that is not something he can easily relate to. This is the root of his conflict with Batman.Just as Clark struggles to genuinely relate to most people, Snyder's Batman either refuses to or otherwise just can't relate to Superman. He doesn't see him as anything but a threat regardless of Superman's clear good intentions. Remember, a small group of Kryptonians were able to bring humanity to the brink of extinction in less than a day, and Bruce Wayne is nothing if not a realist. He didn't know the guy from Kansas. He only knew the god from another world.While Batman's anger toward and fear of Superman are readily apparent from the start, Superman's inability to imagine things from Bruce Wayne's perspective only becomes truly apparent during their first real interaction. This reminded me of the animated version of the \"world's finest\" storyline, where Superman judges Batman harshly for using fear tactics and threats of violence (also, actual violence) to get the job done. Superman wasn't willing to consider what it would take for a human man to fight criminals and save innocents, or what that life would do to him over time. Just as Batman didn't see the guy from Kansas, Superman didn't see the man who lives his life trapped in one brutal, unthinkably traumatic moment (this was beautifully conveyed during the film's opening moments), and had spent his whole adult life bearing witness to humanity at its absolute worst.The conflict between these two characters is as old as human history. They want the same things, but they can't understand one another. So they fight. And what a fight it was.Watching a fight between, say, Captain America and Iron Man was, to me, more frustrating than anything because each understood the other's perspective perfectly. The fight between Batman and Superman in BvS was genuinely gut-wrenching, as intended, because they would have understood one another if either had tried. The whole sequence hilighted Batman's tactical prowess and ability to control a situation. Maybe the most badass thing about the fight was that it ended exactly where Batman planned. That brings me to the big elephant in the room named \"Martha.\"I can't recall exactly which YouTuber put it this way, but if you thought the \"save Martha\" exchange was about their mothers having the same name, you had your brain turned off. The brain-on people have explained this to death, but it bears repeating. This was the moment when Superman became humanized to Batman. He was about to die, and his only concern was for his adoptive human mother. He still believed that the man about to take his life would do the right thing. Even with the cowl on, there was no mistaking the look on Batman's face. It was the look of shame, guilt, and sudden uncertainty that says \"What am I doing?\" Turns out even the most brutal, angry version of Bruce Wayne is better than Tony Stark at knowing right from wrong. At knowing that he had gone too far.From there, the third act was a series of truly impressive (albeit mostly CGI) fight sequences, beginning with what I regard as the undisputed champion of Batman fights. Nothing in the Nolan movies (and especially nothing in the Burton movies) even came close. Go ahead, try to convince yourself that Batman and Bane taking turns punching one another in the face until Bane's mask broke was a good fight sequence. No, this was a fight straight out of \"Arkham Knight,\" and it was glorious. The battle against Doomsday really was one for the books. From the moment Wonder Woman arrived accompanied by the intense sounds of Tina Guo's electric cello to Superman's tragic, heroic death at the hands of Doomsday, I was glued to the screen. Sure, the mere presence of Doomsday spoiled the end to a degree, but watching the Man of Steel laboring to carry that kryptonite spear towards certain death was no less impactful. A brief word on Jesse Eisenberg's take on Lex Luthor. At least one other reviewer on this site already said it best when they pointed out that this was his origin story. If you consider his scheme objectively, he is actually one of the more formidable incarnations of the character. If we're lucky, we'll eventually get to see a Snyder Cut of \"Justice League\" and find out where this story was actually meant to go. For the record, Joss Whedon and Danny Elfman both should have said \"no\" to taking a dump on someone else's art."
"BATMAN V SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE brings a fantastic surprise to a smash-hit team-up with one of the worlds most beloved DC Comics' icons of all time. The movie delivers spectacular casting, and fantastic acting with different characters having their shine in each scenes.The story follows Clark Kent/Superman who becomes a threat, after the destruction in Metropolis in Man Of Steel.(2013). Batman/Bruce Wayne sees him as a threat and begins his war on Superman.The movie brings spectacular storytelling, it tells the complications of human against alien who are on the same side, and the first meeting of Batman and Superman. The story of Bruce Wayne, with his many years of The Caped Crusader, sends him on a spiral of \"out of control\", sheer anger, and builds tension to wanting to defeat the Man of Steel. Snyder has fantastically gave this storytelling an exciting nod to the comics.Lex Luthor, played by Jesse Einsberg, delivers a very interesting performance, but very differently by him showing is his \"origin\" before he becomes a bald foe to the Man of Steel. He shows that his love of \"god vs man\" terrorises mankind when he ultimately creates Doomsday, and Batman realises Superman's inner heroism.It packs so many great \"out of nowhere\" excitement, including a first-look of the fearful Wonder Woman a.k.a. Diana Prince, played by Gal Gadot, and a fresh-new glimpse of the superhero DC canon: The Justice League.WATCH THIS MOVIE! The critics are out of their mind. It's a fun-packed action adventure which still keeps the movie enjoyable until it's final minutes of the movie. It's a FANTASTIC MOVIE! BEN AFFLECK AS BATMAN... is Incredible!A 10/10 overall!"
"I want to go on record as saying that this is a truly thrilling cinematic experience in so many ways. If pressed, I guess I could acknowledge that there were a couple ... let's say \"clumsy\" moments. And in a film that runs to three hours, that hardly seems like a significant issue, certainly not enough to rate it with fewer than 9 stars.This film has everything. There is dramatic tension right from the start. There is a magnificent story arc that picks up quite seamlessly from 'Man of Steel' and propels the viewer not only into the life of Clark Kent/Superman but also of Bruce Wayne/Batman.The villain is no mere cartoon of a villain; he is truly thoroughly (and apparently irrevocably) diabolical. He is a psychopath, and you wish for his death over and over and over. You want Superman to reduce him to ash with the power of his eyes.I have read a number of viewers' reviews, and it seems that the people who disliked the film / gave it a low rating had rather unfair and unrealistic expectations of it. That is, their own prejudices about how the plot could/should unfold or what the character development could/should be, etc. ruined the film for them. And that is a shame.My thought is: I settle into my seat, wait for the lights to dim, and then I wait to be transported by the film. I accept it, lock, stock, and barrel.As another reviewer remarked, I love how the film begins from the point of view of Bruce Wayne as he is among people on the ground who have fallen victim to the attack of Zod and the other Kryptonians.Why would Bruce Wayne not like Superman? Why would the good people of Earth hurl insults at Superman and burn him in effigy (on the news)? Because the good people of Earth just got catapulted into a new reality in which there are not only extraterrestrial beings (surprise!) but they are also superman! And a group of them are hell-bent on destroying humankind and taking the planet for themselves.It is difficult to see Superman as separate from the whole Kryptonian Krew.It seems that many moviegoers forgot that Bruce Wayne is also human. Sure, he's a hero, but he is flawed.. Just like the rest of us. He is a vigilante, after all.He has let his vigilantism get the better of him. HE is actually the one working outside the boundaries of the law, not Superman. It is the clear head of Alfred that shows us that he has gone into a rather dark place, that he has not seen what is really going on (in Luthor's scheme), and so he chooses to embark on his own scheme scheme to take out the alien invader. He is (allegedly) thinking of the future: if he wipes out the all-powerful alien, then it can't turn on humankind in the future. At least, he convinces himself of that.A philosophical question is raised in the film: should Clark Kent have remained a simple man from Kansas and never have become the Superman? Should he just let people die and let calamities happen? The question is answered for us in the character of Diana Prince/Wonder Woman. She withdrew from mankind (her exact words) and just sat around watching. Watching while people died horrible deaths all around her. So, should Superman have done the same? Do these special beings, these 'metahumans', have some kind of moral imperative to intervene, or should they be allowed to be regular people, too? It seems that humans want it both ways.It seems that humans are saying: \"Don't be a superalien ... except when I and my friends and family are in trouble. Then come save us.\""

"Batman v Superman: Ultimate Edition: If your looking for a quick, cheap thrill then you might not enjoy this film at the time. This movies theatrical version was butchered by WB and in doing so reshaped the story leaving numerous plot holes. So the Ultimate Edition is the full story and the one worth seeing. Watch 'Man of Steel' before seeing this movie. There is much to claw through here, so much so that the audience might easily find themselves exhausted from the overall aggression of the film. However, a lot of the story does work. The action is good, and the emotion feels real most of the time.This film is about Superman trying to become Superman. Trying to help the world, save people, find a place in this world not as an outcast, and yet is looked at has a threat by many. Superman is not from this world, yet He is trying to be human, find a place in this world, be excepted by earths people, and come into his destiny.This film is also about Batman being Batman for 20 years and losing faith in humanity, and fearing Superman, what Superman can do with his powers. Great film, great plot, great visuals. ---Yidioo"
"I didn't see the film in the theaters and just bought the \"Extended Edition \" on Amazon. I never properly saw Man of Steel- i think I rented it and watched it when already exhausted and fell asleep. I saw the mediocre user reviews and horrible reviews from critics of this film.They really have it wrong. This is the very best either Batman or Superman. It has a different take, on things. Much darker then earlier films even darker then the Christopher Nolan Batman films.First of all Christopher Nolan is an Executive Producer. So how bad could it be? I loved Sucker Punch and Zack Snyder was involved with that. So how bad could this be? Hans Zimmer did the music, so how bad could it be?I remember watching the old Superman TV shows and reading the Superman and Batman comics as a little kid and loved them, but i wouldn't call myself a \"fan boy\" of comic universes, like so many younger people today. As an older adult I will admit my favorite TV show of all time was Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but watched it on DVD only after it had finished. I saw the second of the Dark Knight series in the theater, but the other two, I watched on DVD. They were great, but not my favorite films like so many people. i also loved the first couple Superman and Batman films in the older series. Regardless, i was not waiting with baited breath to see Man of Steel or this one.I'm more of a serious film fan, who can watch Stanley Kubrick films over and over and my favorite films in the last twenty years, are Eyes Wide Shut and Intersteller, both of which i've watched multiple times.So, with that said, take it from me, the critics have this film very wrong, just as critics hated 2001: A Space Odyssey when it first came out. This film will have lasting appreciation.Surprised how much I liked Ben Afleck's Batman. it was hard to get into Henry Cavil's scrawnier looking Superman, but it grew on me. Amy Adams was great as Lois Lane, The Gal Gadol Wonder Women was amazing. Lex Luther was terrific, like Nolan's Joker. Jeremy Irons was the best Alfred ever. Holly Hunter and Diane Lane was good too. The movie had bad reviews but made a billion dollars. Hopefully everyone buys the Ultimate Edition and it breaks sales records and the film is re-appreciated. I have no idea what scenes this Ultimate Edition added, but it is pretty perfect. Now I can't wait for Wonder Woman and the Justice League and as soon as I finish writing this am going to watch Man of Steal. I'm into it now!I can only surmise that the bad reviews stem from too much expectations of the rigid fan boy types and the radical changes in tone, we see in this film.Total masterpiece of cinema, but I have a few criticisms. There are a few hollow scenes of typical Idiot cops and authorities getting everything wrong in a cliché type way and it has a few filler scenes of that type and a few moments here and there that felt rushed and cheesy. Maybe not everything restored into the Ultimate Edition should have been. I wish there had been more Kevin Costner scenes."

"The whole entire Batman V Superman movie was great and yes even though it felt slow to the majority of the people who watched it but to me I enjoyed every part and every scene of Batman V Superman and when it got to the fight scenes both batman VS Superman and the Doomsday fight it brought so much drama, intensity, and epic performances. So with that being said I give this movie a good 10/10 because it really did go to my expectations and it brought a powerful performance and a powerful yet epic introduction to the upcoming Justice League."

"When I first wrote a review for this movie a year ago exclaiming my excitement for the film, I had been high off a fresh dose of live-action DC superheroes playing out the beloved comic book stories that I had grown up on. It was all playing out before my eyes and coming to life. After a few months had passed, I began to notice things about the movie that I disliked: little gaps in the story, things that didn't add up, etc. My original rating of a 10 / 10 dropped to an 8 /10. But today it has gone back up to a 10. The extended version of the film not only rectifies the gaps but also silences critics.Many claimed that the movie was too dark or that it just didn't make sense. To those people, I say: \"Pick up a comic book!\" Many of the critics of this particular film were part of the superhero bandwagon that formed when Marvel began its spree of Avengers-related films. In fact, its estimated that over 60% of people who go to see 'superhero' genre films have never picked up a comic book in their life. I would argue that similar numbers could figure to those which view the CW televised DC Universe shows. People complain that DC comics is just too dark but the fact is that these movies are based upon actual comics which are meant to be dark (ex: The Dark Knight Returns, Injustice, etc.). Its like complaining that Game of Thrones (the TV series) sucks because they kill off too many characters. Read the books! Its frustrating to see such a beautiful work of art like Batman V Superman criticized by those ignorant to its universe and its meaning. This movie is in fact a catalyst that opens numerous doorways and leaves true fans in awe of the possibilities for future movies. But regardless of whether or not people choose to educate themselves, this film's DVD/Blu-ray extended version puts the theater release to shame. All of the plot holes and gaps are filled in 30 minutes of extended footage scattered throughout the film. The movie ultimately becomes more complete and people will wish that the movie had shown the full 3 hours of footage in its theatrical debut. As a major DC comics fan, I will of course pick up on things that a comics fan would not, but someone who does not read comics would learn to appreciate this film in its entirety with the extended version. Get your hands on a copy today or find it on Netflix or the internet somewhere!"

"I ignored the bad reviews and watched anyways. This film had a lot to live up to after Civil War was released and I went into this film expecting the worst. It ended up to be the best Superhero film of 2016 to me. One complaint was that this film was more concerned about universe building than telling a great story than Civil War but for me it was the other way around; Civil War felt like a build up to something else and to be honest, I felt that way when I saw the other MCU films. Batman vs Superman however not only had a great story, but it also felt a lot more consistent than Civil War. This film was way more diverse with the cast than the MCU but unlike the MCU, I felt like this film doesn't go overboard with the SJW stuff like the MCU films or The Star Wars Sequel films do. The Visuals were AMAZING, The Score by Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL was AMAZING as well, The Tone is just right as I actually felt for the characters emotionally, The Cinematography kept my eyes glued to the screen, and the script felt really Intelligent and Complex and despite people calling the writing confusing, I was able to piece it together with no problem whatsoever. This film is similar to Empire Strikes back in terms of popularity so over time after the other movies are released, this movie would probably be more popular.This film was way better than I Expected and deserves another chance.

"Its shame to see what critics and marvel fans did to this movie and targeted Zack Snyder for it. I have seen this movie more than 25 times till date. And i enjoy this movie as much as i enjoyed the first time. The fans who have read DC comics, wouldn't be disappointed in this movie. Its dark movie, yes it is. Because the title shows the intense situation at hand. Two superheroes about to rip each other apart for whatever reasons that brought them to this stage. Yes it had to be dark and intense.Only marvel can be stupid enough to show an alien invasion where humans are loosing the battle and the super heroes are cracking jokes while battles as if they are playing ping pong. a person playing Call of Duty game is more serious while playing than the marvel heroes fighting aliens."

"Last week some news came out from somebody online who had claimed to have seen a finished version of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. If you were like me, you've been leery of checking it out because you weren't sure how much might actually be true. Now Zack Snyder has spoken out about the spoiler-filled post, although his response doesn't really clear anything up.In a word, to MTV, he called the post \"hilarious,which might imply that he's saying that it's mostly, if not entirely, untrue. That might be the case, but then again he could have just said it was untrue and he didn't say that. What he did say, however, is that he doesn't like spoilers. While this may seem odd for the director who's most recent trailer appeared to give away the entire movie, Snyder says that's not the case. Even if you've seen the trailer, you can rest easy, as there is much more we have not seen in then finished film. Says Snyder I have the benefit of seeing the movie. It's cool that think it's too much, and I appreciate people not wanting to know, but there's plenty that they don't know. There's a lot of movie that's not in the trailer. In the process of calling the Batman v Superman Reddit review hilarious, Snyder goes on to talk about how he hates it when spoilers come out. The director would much rather that fans see the movie mostly blind. While he understands that some fans may wish to find the answers before hand, he wants his movies to be mysteries going in. If you're, as an audience member, exploring these articles, looking for answers to questions that you have, maybe you're okay with knowing before you go. It's like an individual taste. But like I said, I want people to see the movie without knowing.Spoilers are a topic that mean different things to different people. While most try to avoid them to some degree, the need to solve the mystery is a nearly universal human experience. We have an inclination to want to know the truth, even while also wanting to be surprised. For most of us getting some information is good, but getting all the information is bad, of course, only getting the details that you want can be difficult."
"The theatrical is choppy, poorly edited, hard to follow, with some really good moments mixed in their. The extended is much more fluent and is much easier to follow, it does have a long runtime, which might make it seem a bit dragging on, but if you like long films done right, like Lord of the Rings, you will like this movie as long as you get into the characters and story. Speaking of which, the story starts out perfectly showing Bruce Wayne as a character, and it is very powerful. There are several moments in this movie that are powerful, emotional, and shocking. Characters. Batman is my favorite fictional character of all time, and believe me when I say, Ben Affleck as Batman was perfect, he had the charisma, the anger, and the look of being through some bad stuff Gal Gadot also does perfect as Wonder Woman, but if you want to really see how good she does, go watch the Wonder Woman movie. Henry Call as Superman. I really don't like it when people say Christopher Reeves is better. Don't get me wrong, Reeves does great, but can you imagine him as Superman in this movie? I wouldn't like it. It would be like Adam West playing Batman in The Dark Knight. Henry Cavill does great in this role, I can say everything about him as I said with Ben Affleck. Jesse Eisenberg as Luthor. I thought it was different in a good way. I've heard a criticism for him as being too much like Joker, but is that a bad thing? Joker is my favorite villain, so to see Superman have an enemy that crazy, but still hold the values Luthor needs to be Luthor, I think it is great. The thing I thought this movie was lacking in the first and second acts was humor, at least good humor. If there was more humor, I would've given this movie a ten because it would give a more relaxing feel to the parts that needed it. All in all though, this movie was awesome, it had powerful moments, it was badass, and just plain fun. It had a great story arc and does its job very well."

"*I will be talking about the Ultimate Edition of the film* This was one of the most anticipated CBM of all time. Ever since the arrival and subsequent success of Marvel's The Avengers people have wondered when will DC launch its own cinematic universe, one of the main reasons being the opportunity to finally see titans such as Batman and Superman share the screen together: the ultimate nerd dream. On 2016, the moment finally came for BvS to be released AND.. it performed poorly. Not only did critical reception left a lot to be desired, but fan reactions where surprisingly split after its cinematic debut. People either loved it and called Zack a genius, or hated it and called him a hack. Me, personally, I found myself with middle of the road feelings, for sure, but more leaning towards the negative side with subsequent viewings. The theatrical cut of the film showcased amazing performances, incredible visuals, and action set pieces that seemed like comic book panels come to life, in a good way. However, when it comes to its narrative structure and more technical aspects like editing, the film was seriously flawed. More plot holes than Age of Ultron, questionable character decisions, random editing that lacked cohesion and focus, and forced dramatic moments that lacked any impact because the attempts at character development ranged from limited to nonexistent, especially when it comes to Superman's character. I thought it was a 5/10 movie at best. As such, I was kind of skeptical about the idea of a 30 minute longer version. I say kind of because I know how Zack works. I remember Watchmen being vastly improved with its director's cut, so in a way I was expecting BvS to perform in a similar manner, but I also feared those 30 minutes wold be just there to amplify action and discredit storytelling issues. Oh boy, I'm so glad I was proved wrong. The ultimate cut of the film was infuriating, but not because it was awful, but because it questions the sanity of WB executives and editors and makes you wonder what were they thinking during the editing process. What I got out of the Ultimate Edition was a thought-provoking deconstruction of two very iconic superheroes that gave spotlight to the struggles both of them face when they aren't fighting crime. What I got was an extremely well produced character study on both Batman and Superman in a cynical world, a world dangerously close to our own. We meet Batman as a ruthless, worn out hero that has seen the failure behind his ideals and witnessed some truly horrifying things in his life. Superman, on the other hand, is portrayed as a godlike figure that seeks to do good in the world, but finds himself emotionally conflicted once he realized that every good deed he does leaves behind a trail of destruction (most of it due to Luthor's antics). In my opinion, this is a hugely original approach, one that distances itself from the rest of the competition and delivers a dark, somber, yet relevant superhero movie that understands both characters and gives them real human struggles to deal with. I felt invested in both of them, and hoped that by the end of the film both could find a way to redeem themselves. Their character arcs were very well established during the first two acts of the movie, and by the time we get to the titular climactic battle the emotion behind the jaw-dropping action is intensified. Lex Luthor as a villain was also given more time to develop with this new edition. One of the main criticisms with the original version was the fact that his plan relied too much on conveniences, and the character's mannerisms and mad-scientist attitude was annoying, and that goes without saying his motivations were unclear. Not only do we spend more time understanding his hate for any godlike figure and thus his hatred for Superman, but the added scenes allowed us to witness his entire plan come to fruition. It sells the cold, manipulative, calculating attributes of his comic counterpart. The acting is spot on. Every actor owns his/her role, from Cavill's Superman, to Ben Affleck as Batman, Eisenberg as Luthor, and Gadot as Wonder Woman, whose scenes are brief, but are more than enough to sell the strong and ferocious warrior that she is. Cinematography is stunning, and miles above that of Man of Steel's. And the soundtrack by Zimmer and Junkie XL? Perfect, just perfect. When it comes to flaws, the film still has some of those. The Martha moment, while serving as a pivotal character moment for Batman, felt off in execution, and its understandable that many people got mad at it. If your main complaint about BvS the first time around was its bleak tone and subject matter, this film is still not for you. I understand most were expecting to see the heroes being the most iconic versions of themselves, clashing in an elongated battle and evoking the same feelings The Avengers gave audiences back in 2012. In that sense, the film will remain divisive, but at least I have the comfort of saying that, at the very least, the film is competently made."

"This film was amazing. Ben Affleck was easily the best part of this movie, he brought his a-game as Batman. The chemistry between Affleck & Irons was outstanding. Gal Gadot did a great job as Wonder Woman. The fight between Batman & Superman was awesome. The final fight with Doomsday was outstanding in every way possible. However, there is only one problem with this film and that's Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor. He was sadly missed cast in this role, but then again it's really the fault of Warner Bros. Studios. Overall, this film deliver on almost every level. I highly recommend that you watch the extended version of this film."

"I know I know. I saw it in theaters too, and felt like it could've been so much better. While the Batman element was good, the narrative felt fractured, and the third act was just one long stunt scene. Superman was relegated to a supporting character, and other characters didn't get a chance to shine. And then I chanced on the ultimate cut. Calling it 30 mins of \"extra\" footage is unfair to Zack Snyder because it's exactly these 30 mins that makes the movie a worthy one. What I can say about the theatrical cut is this - It had the blockbuster elements - music, visuals, stunts, CGI. But, it lacked the human elements. The first 20 mins of the movie had it, but not after that. The extended cut in comparison has a flow to the narrative. There are no disjointed scenes, everything flows smoothly, and there's connective tissue. Superman gets to spend some time with his father, and mother. Clark Kent does some investigative journalism. Superman helps the people after the blast. Lois Lane doesn't jump to conclusions, she gets to the bottom of the crime. Lex Luthor apparently had a coherent plan - everything is explained pretty well. Wonder Woman was already good, so there's no change there :) Also, the \"Martha\" scene seems better executed, because it is a few seconds longer, and there's time to breathe it in. So, here's my take on this movie - The theatrical cut was junk. Get the Bluray for ultimate edition, and you shall not be disappointed. I've seen it so many more times now, and it's the definitive cut. It is the movie we deserve. It's a unique take on Batman, and Superman. It's a gritty take on the superhero movie genre, and definitely the best DCEU movie, and the best DC movie since The Dark Knight.P.S. Yes it's dark. We're adults, and we should appreciate mature film making without intentionally silly moments. It attempts to be philosophical, and something deep instead of just trying to make you chuckle."

"This is one of the best superhero movies ever made. Zack Snyder is a magician behind the camera.The reason behind so many complaints is the fact that Warner Bros. marketed this movie as a fight between Batman and Superman. That's not what it is. It's a movie about the origins of the Justice League.The cinematography, the acting and the score are all second to none. This film is phenomenal.P.S: watch the 3 hour extended cut that Snyder intended you to see, not the 2 and a half hour movie that Warner Bros. decided would be better for theaters."

"I don't care what the critics say, this is a very well-done movie. I'll start my review by listing what I like about the movie.1.) Ben Affleck is the best batman to me and it is not close. He pulls off the role of an aging batman extremely well. Also, Zack Snyder's vision of batman is legit. I have always hated batman up until this adaptation of him. Instead of being a conflicted and idealistic batman, this batman is dark, gritty, and 100% a badass. His equipment is decked out with machine guns and he has no aversion to killing people. In fact, he probably kills about 50 criminal by the time this movie is over. The warehouse scene is the coolest batman scene in any movie.2.) The development of a grudge between batman and superman is pulled off flawlessly. It actually makes sense why batman dislikes superman. Then, when they do fight it is about the coolest thing you can expect to see from a superhero film. 3.) I disagree with a lot of people about Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor. In my opinion, he played his role to perfection. 4.) B v S sets up Wonder Woman and Justice League with Gal Gadot's cameo as Wonder Woman and short clips of Aquaman, the Flash, and Cyborg. B v S is one of my favorite superhero films and rewatching it never gets old."

"The theatrical cut of this film is garbage which is why I rated it eight stars instead of nine. The first time I watched this film I didn't like it (not straight out hate but didn't like). Character motivations didn't make any sense, Lex was annoying as s***, editing was sloppy, and it was overly dark and broody for an action superhero movie. A year + a half, five Marvel films, a ton of bad reviews and a Justice League later a thought popped into my head: \"what if I watched BVS again\". This time I didn't have trailers ruining the best moments, I only vaguely remembered the film, and I was conditioned to look at it negatively but something unexpected happened: I actually loved it. Superman was just a normal person that tried to make a difference cause he could that others imposed their own beliefs on. Lex Luthor was a genius that couldn't stand his powerlessness compared to Superman or more accurately a super being. As Alfred said \"The fever, the rage, the feeling of powerlessness that turns good men... cruel\" and you see the same thought process in Batman. Batman, just like Lex Luthor feels powerless in the midst of a god-being and just like Lex he attempts to destroy him so he can get his sense of power back but unlike Lex, Batman learns something. I what is one of the corniest lines of the movie Superman says, \"Martha\" when he knows he can't win against Batman in a late desperate attempt to save his mother. Not only does this name connect with Bruce Wayne but it also shows what really matters to a man of steel: it isn't power, it isn't fame or anything else, it is his Mother and on a broader scale it is people. Lex (who doesn't care about people at all) knows he doesn't have the power so he creates something from his blood and the remains of Zod: A Doomsday for Superman. Not only does this film have depth but it also doesn't always explain it to you which is rare in a blockbuster action superhero flick normally cater to semi-comic book fans and people that want to shove popcorn in their mouths. This film rewards you for really noticing the details while still having massive explosions. One of my favorites is how Lex has all of Batman's branded killed which is why he isn't afraid of the branding at the end or Grandma's Peach Tea as a way of scaring the s*** out of someone. Of course, this film isn't perfect and I do have personal dislikes. The Batman V Superman fight was slow and pretty boring especially after watching such an amazing fight in Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 2 (If you haven't watched the animated Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 1 and 2 you are sorely missing out on something fantastic). Also, the addition of Wonder Woman who pretty much steals a hacker thing, gives it back and then suits up and fights against a giant monster thing. Not to say I don't like Wonder Woman (She is one of my favorite Superheroes of all time who showed not only can woman kick a** but they also don't need to be ashamed of their sexuality or gender) but she wasn't really that helpful to the plot and just brought in to expand the universe which was well done through Lex's superhuman hunting files. Also, the post-apocalyptic scene that was just a dream could have been cut but nothing is perfect except movies like Citizen Kane which isn't a lot of fun to watch cause it is too perfect. So to summarize, the theatrical cut is bad, the ultimate cut is Amazing and the other cut is meh. Please give it a second chance because it deserves it and save a good director from losing grace because of something he didn't do."
"I really liked it, don't know what all the hate is about. I'm actually a Marvel fan from when I was 7 or so, but Superman and Batman together in 1 movie? Just great. And personally I like Ben Affleck even better than Christian Bale as Batman. So just watch and enjoy, I know I did!"

"That's right. We have been waiting for these two heroes to finally meet and fight against each other. This movie is so good in both plot and special effects.Henry Cavill and Ben Affleck have performed well in their acting stages. They are the best superhero actors and they have filmed their fighting scenes very well. The movie starts to show the conflict between the lives of the heroes and now they have blamed each other for it. This movie is amazing and sets up a good plot for Dawn Justice."

"Actually...I didn't know what to expect. When you see Wonder Woman, you know it will be off of Wonder Woman and off of a Wonder Woman story, but with Batman V Superman, I was like, \"hmmmm, so who is this about?\" It was pretty obvious that it would feature many characters, but I thought the introduction to Batman was amazing. Ben Affleck nailed the part, not only as Batman but also as Bruce Wayne. He is my Batman. Henry Cavill continued to be super as the Man of Steel. And he is my Super - Man. A dark story? Yes, without a doubt. Could it have had a few more jokes? Sure. But not all movies or stories need to have jokes when certain events are serious. I really hope people can see this review and take another look at the movie, because, I loved it. I really hope the ratings can go up, eventually. And P.S, this movie is the perfect set up to Justice League."

"I'll start by making it clear I have only ever seen the Ultimate Edition. I'm aware of what was cut out for the theatrical release, so I will concede up front that most of the criticisms about pacing, editing, and missing bits of plot at release were merited.With that caveat out of the way, I must reiterate that this was bar-none the boldest superhero movie I have ever seen. To me, it was arguably the best as well, though \"best\" shouldn't be taken to mean \"most enjoyable.\" That honor easily goes to \"Thor: Ragnarok.\" What makes BvS stand out among other films in the genre is that it takes two characters who have been done to death since the 1970s and brings them up to date. I recently tried to watch \"Superman: The Movie\" for the first time in a number of years, and while it was still good and Reeves will always be iconic, I just couldn't take it seriously. I'll put it this way: If the story in BvS was \"stupid\" in your view but Superman turning back time by spinning the earth backward on its axis didn't seem like one of the dumbest things you have ever seen -in any movie from any genre- to the extent that it outright ruins the movie for you, then your opinion about BvS isn't worth much. Nostalgic bias was always going to be a problem for this movie, and the way people reacted to and reviewed \"Man of Steel\" was telling in this regard.That brings me to Zack Snyder's take on Superman. You know, that guy whose status as the first extraterrestrial ever encountered by humanity was a total non-issue in the old movies. Apparently, Snyder has a similar view to my own in that his take on the Man of Steel makes his being an alien a core piece of his identity. He may look like any other (absurdly attractive) person, but he knows what he is, and that makes him perpetually uncertain of where he fits in this world. He is essentially good and really does care about people, but he struggles to truly empathize with the likes of us. To be human is to be frail, and that is not something he can easily relate to. This is the root of his conflict with Batman.Just as Clark struggles to genuinely relate to most people, Snyder's Batman either refuses to or otherwise just can't relate to Superman. He doesn't see him as anything but a threat regardless of Superman's clear good intentions. Remember, a small group of Kryptonians were able to bring humanity to the brink of extinction in less than a day, and Bruce Wayne is nothing if not a realist. He didn't know the guy from Kansas. He only knew the god from another world.While Batman's anger toward and fear of Superman are readily apparent from the start, Superman's inability to imagine things from Bruce Wayne's perspective only becomes truly apparent during their first real interaction. This reminded me of the animated version of the \"world's finest\" storyline, where Superman judges Batman harshly for using fear tactics and threats of violence (also, actual violence) to get the job done. Superman wasn't willing to consider what it would take for a human man to fight criminals and save innocents, or what that life would do to him over time. Just as Batman didn't see the guy from Kansas, Superman didn't see the man who lives his life trapped in one brutal, unthinkably traumatic moment (this was beautifully conveyed during the film's opening moments), and had spent his whole adult life bearing witness to humanity at its absolute worst.The conflict between these two characters is as old as human history. They want the same things, but they can't understand one another. So they fight. And what a fight it was.Watching a fight between, say, Captain America and Iron Man was, to me, more frustrating than anything because each understood the other's perspective perfectly. The fight between Batman and Superman in BvS was genuinely gut-wrenching, as intended, because they would have understood one another if either had tried. The whole sequence hilighted Batman's tactical prowess and ability to control a situation. Maybe the most badass thing about the fight was that it ended exactly where Batman planned. That brings me to the big elephant in the room named \"Martha.\"I can't recall exactly which YouTuber put it this way, but if you thought the \"save Martha\" exchange was about their mothers having the same name, you had your brain turned off. The brain-on people have explained this to death, but it bears repeating. This was the moment when Superman became humanized to Batman. He was about to die, and his only concern was for his adoptive human mother. He still believed that the man about to take his life would do the right thing. Even with the cowl on, there was no mistaking the look on Batman's face. It was the look of shame, guilt, and sudden uncertainty that says \"What am I doing?\" Turns out even the most brutal, angry version of Bruce Wayne is better than Tony Stark at knowing right from wrong. At knowing that he had gone too far.From there, the third act was a series of truly impressive (albeit mostly CGI) fight sequences, beginning with what I regard as the undisputed champion of Batman fights. Nothing in the Nolan movies (and especially nothing in the Burton movies) even came close. Go ahead, try to convince yourself that Batman and Bane taking turns punching one another in the face until Bane's mask broke was a good fight sequence. No, this was a fight straight out of \"Arkham Knight,\" and it was glorious. The battle against Doomsday really was one for the books. From the moment Wonder Woman arrived accompanied by the intense sounds of Tina Guo's electric cello to Superman's tragic, heroic death at the hands of Doomsday, I was glued to the screen. Sure, the mere presence of Doomsday spoiled the end to a degree, but watching the Man of Steel laboring to carry that kryptonite spear towards certain death was no less impactful. A brief word on Jesse Eisenberg's take on Lex Luthor. At least one other reviewer on this site already said it best when they pointed out that this was his origin story. If you consider his scheme objectively, he is actually one of the more formidable incarnations of the character. If we're lucky, we'll eventually get to see a Snyder Cut of \"Justice League\" and find out where this story was actually meant to go. For the record, Joss Whedon and Danny Elfman both should have said \"no\" to taking a dump on someone else's art."
"BATMAN V SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE brings a fantastic surprise to a smash-hit team-up with one of the worlds most beloved DC Comics' icons of all time. The movie delivers spectacular casting, and fantastic acting with different characters having their shine in each scenes.The story follows Clark Kent/Superman who becomes a threat, after the destruction in Metropolis in Man Of Steel.(2013). Batman/Bruce Wayne sees him as a threat and begins his war on Superman.The movie brings spectacular storytelling, it tells the complications of human against alien who are on the same side, and the first meeting of Batman and Superman. The story of Bruce Wayne, with his many years of The Caped Crusader, sends him on a spiral of \"out of control\", sheer anger, and builds tension to wanting to defeat the Man of Steel. Snyder has fantastically gave this storytelling an exciting nod to the comics.Lex Luthor, played by Jesse Einsberg, delivers a very interesting performance, but very differently by him showing is his \"origin\" before he becomes a bald foe to the Man of Steel. He shows that his love of \"god vs man\" terrorises mankind when he ultimately creates Doomsday, and Batman realises Superman's inner heroism.It packs so many great \"out of nowhere\" excitement, including a first-look of the fearful Wonder Woman a.k.a. Diana Prince, played by Gal Gadot, and a fresh-new glimpse of the superhero DC canon: The Justice League.WATCH THIS MOVIE! The critics are out of their mind. It's a fun-packed action adventure which still keeps the movie enjoyable until it's final minutes of the movie. It's a FANTASTIC MOVIE! BEN AFFLECK AS BATMAN... is Incredible!A 10/10 overall!"
"I want to go on record as saying that this is a truly thrilling cinematic experience in so many ways. If pressed, I guess I could acknowledge that there were a couple ... let's say \"clumsy\" moments. And in a film that runs to three hours, that hardly seems like a significant issue, certainly not enough to rate it with fewer than 9 stars.This film has everything. There is dramatic tension right from the start. There is a magnificent story arc that picks up quite seamlessly from 'Man of Steel' and propels the viewer not only into the life of Clark Kent/Superman but also of Bruce Wayne/Batman.The villain is no mere cartoon of a villain; he is truly thoroughly (and apparently irrevocably) diabolical. He is a psychopath, and you wish for his death over and over and over. You want Superman to reduce him to ash with the power of his eyes.I have read a number of viewers' reviews, and it seems that the people who disliked the film / gave it a low rating had rather unfair and unrealistic expectations of it. That is, their own prejudices about how the plot could/should unfold or what the character development could/should be, etc. ruined the film for them. And that is a shame.My thought is: I settle into my seat, wait for the lights to dim, and then I wait to be transported by the film. I accept it, lock, stock, and barrel.As another reviewer remarked, I love how the film begins from the point of view of Bruce Wayne as he is among people on the ground who have fallen victim to the attack of Zod and the other Kryptonians.Why would Bruce Wayne not like Superman? Why would the good people of Earth hurl insults at Superman and burn him in effigy (on the news)? Because the good people of Earth just got catapulted into a new reality in which there are not only extraterrestrial beings (surprise!) but they are also superman! And a group of them are hell-bent on destroying humankind and taking the planet for themselves.It is difficult to see Superman as separate from the whole Kryptonian Krew.It seems that many moviegoers forgot that Bruce Wayne is also human. Sure, he's a hero, but he is flawed.. Just like the rest of us. He is a vigilante, after all.He has let his vigilantism get the better of him. HE is actually the one working outside the boundaries of the law, not Superman. It is the clear head of Alfred that shows us that he has gone into a rather dark place, that he has not seen what is really going on (in Luthor's scheme), and so he chooses to embark on his own scheme scheme to take out the alien invader. He is (allegedly) thinking of the future: if he wipes out the all-powerful alien, then it can't turn on humankind in the future. At least, he convinces himself of that.A philosophical question is raised in the film: should Clark Kent have remained a simple man from Kansas and never have become the Superman? Should he just let people die and let calamities happen? The question is answered for us in the character of Diana Prince/Wonder Woman. She withdrew from mankind (her exact words) and just sat around watching. Watching while people died horrible deaths all around her. So, should Superman have done the same? Do these special beings, these 'metahumans', have some kind of moral imperative to intervene, or should they be allowed to be regular people, too? It seems that humans want it both ways.It seems that humans are saying: \"Don't be a superalien ... except when I and my friends and family are in trouble. Then come save us.\""

"Batman v Superman: Ultimate Edition: If your looking for a quick, cheap thrill then you might not enjoy this film at the time. This movies theatrical version was butchered by WB and in doing so reshaped the story leaving numerous plot holes. So the Ultimate Edition is the full story and the one worth seeing. Watch 'Man of Steel' before seeing this movie. There is much to claw through here, so much so that the audience might easily find themselves exhausted from the overall aggression of the film. However, a lot of the story does work. The action is good, and the emotion feels real most of the time.This film is about Superman trying to become Superman. Trying to help the world, save people, find a place in this world not as an outcast, and yet is looked at has a threat by many. Superman is not from this world, yet He is trying to be human, find a place in this world, be excepted by earths people, and come into his destiny.This film is also about Batman being Batman for 20 years and losing faith in humanity, and fearing Superman, what Superman can do with his powers. Great film, great plot, great visuals. ---Yidioo"
"I didn't see the film in the theaters and just bought the \"Extended Edition \" on Amazon. I never properly saw Man of Steel- i think I rented it and watched it when already exhausted and fell asleep. I saw the mediocre user reviews and horrible reviews from critics of this film.They really have it wrong. This is the very best either Batman or Superman. It has a different take, on things. Much darker then earlier films even darker then the Christopher Nolan Batman films.First of all Christopher Nolan is an Executive Producer. So how bad could it be? I loved Sucker Punch and Zack Snyder was involved with that. So how bad could this be? Hans Zimmer did the music, so how bad could it be?I remember watching the old Superman TV shows and reading the Superman and Batman comics as a little kid and loved them, but i wouldn't call myself a \"fan boy\" of comic universes, like so many younger people today. As an older adult I will admit my favorite TV show of all time was Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but watched it on DVD only after it had finished. I saw the second of the Dark Knight series in the theater, but the other two, I watched on DVD. They were great, but not my favorite films like so many people. i also loved the first couple Superman and Batman films in the older series. Regardless, i was not waiting with baited breath to see Man of Steel or this one.I'm more of a serious film fan, who can watch Stanley Kubrick films over and over and my favorite films in the last twenty years, are Eyes Wide Shut and Intersteller, both of which i've watched multiple times.So, with that said, take it from me, the critics have this film very wrong, just as critics hated 2001: A Space Odyssey when it first came out. This film will have lasting appreciation.Surprised how much I liked Ben Afleck's Batman. it was hard to get into Henry Cavil's scrawnier looking Superman, but it grew on me. Amy Adams was great as Lois Lane, The Gal Gadol Wonder Women was amazing. Lex Luther was terrific, like Nolan's Joker. Jeremy Irons was the best Alfred ever. Holly Hunter and Diane Lane was good too. The movie had bad reviews but made a billion dollars. Hopefully everyone buys the Ultimate Edition and it breaks sales records and the film is re-appreciated. I have no idea what scenes this Ultimate Edition added, but it is pretty perfect. Now I can't wait for Wonder Woman and the Justice League and as soon as I finish writing this am going to watch Man of Steal. I'm into it now!I can only surmise that the bad reviews stem from too much expectations of the rigid fan boy types and the radical changes in tone, we see in this film.Total masterpiece of cinema, but I have a few criticisms. There are a few hollow scenes of typical Idiot cops and authorities getting everything wrong in a cliché type way and it has a few filler scenes of that type and a few moments here and there that felt rushed and cheesy. Maybe not everything restored into the Ultimate Edition should have been. I wish there had been more Kevin Costner scenes."

"The whole entire Batman V Superman movie was great and yes even though it felt slow to the majority of the people who watched it but to me I enjoyed every part and every scene of Batman V Superman and when it got to the fight scenes both batman VS Superman and the Doomsday fight it brought so much drama, intensity, and epic performances. So with that being said I give this movie a good 10/10 because it really did go to my expectations and it brought a powerful performance and a powerful yet epic introduction to the upcoming Justice League."

"When I first wrote a review for this movie a year ago exclaiming my excitement for the film, I had been high off a fresh dose of live-action DC superheroes playing out the beloved comic book stories that I had grown up on. It was all playing out before my eyes and coming to life. After a few months had passed, I began to notice things about the movie that I disliked: little gaps in the story, things that didn't add up, etc. My original rating of a 10 / 10 dropped to an 8 /10. But today it has gone back up to a 10. The extended version of the film not only rectifies the gaps but also silences critics.Many claimed that the movie was too dark or that it just didn't make sense. To those people, I say: \"Pick up a comic book!\" Many of the critics of this particular film were part of the superhero bandwagon that formed when Marvel began its spree of Avengers-related films. In fact, its estimated that over 60% of people who go to see 'superhero' genre films have never picked up a comic book in their life. I would argue that similar numbers could figure to those which view the CW televised DC Universe shows. People complain that DC comics is just too dark but the fact is that these movies are based upon actual comics which are meant to be dark (ex: The Dark Knight Returns, Injustice, etc.). Its like complaining that Game of Thrones (the TV series) sucks because they kill off too many characters. Read the books! Its frustrating to see such a beautiful work of art like Batman V Superman criticized by those ignorant to its universe and its meaning. This movie is in fact a catalyst that opens numerous doorways and leaves true fans in awe of the possibilities for future movies. But regardless of whether or not people choose to educate themselves, this film's DVD/Blu-ray extended version puts the theater release to shame. All of the plot holes and gaps are filled in 30 minutes of extended footage scattered throughout the film. The movie ultimately becomes more complete and people will wish that the movie had shown the full 3 hours of footage in its theatrical debut. As a major DC comics fan, I will of course pick up on things that a comics fan would not, but someone who does not read comics would learn to appreciate this film in its entirety with the extended version. Get your hands on a copy today or find it on Netflix or the internet somewhere!"

"I ignored the bad reviews and watched anyways. This film had a lot to live up to after Civil War was released and I went into this film expecting the worst. It ended up to be the best Superhero film of 2016 to me. One complaint was that this film was more concerned about universe building than telling a great story than Civil War but for me it was the other way around; Civil War felt like a build up to something else and to be honest, I felt that way when I saw the other MCU films. Batman vs Superman however not only had a great story, but it also felt a lot more consistent than Civil War. This film was way more diverse with the cast than the MCU but unlike the MCU, I felt like this film doesn't go overboard with the SJW stuff like the MCU films or The Star Wars Sequel films do. The Visuals were AMAZING, The Score by Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL was AMAZING as well, The Tone is just right as I actually felt for the characters emotionally, The Cinematography kept my eyes glued to the screen, and the script felt really Intelligent and Complex and despite people calling the writing confusing, I was able to piece it together with no problem whatsoever. This film is similar to Empire Strikes back in terms of popularity so over time after the other movies are released, this movie would probably be more popular.This film was way better than I Expected and deserves another chance.

"Its shame to see what critics and marvel fans did to this movie and targeted Zack Snyder for it. I have seen this movie more than 25 times till date. And i enjoy this movie as much as i enjoyed the first time. The fans who have read DC comics, wouldn't be disappointed in this movie. Its dark movie, yes it is. Because the title shows the intense situation at hand. Two superheroes about to rip each other apart for whatever reasons that brought them to this stage. Yes it had to be dark and intense.Only marvel can be stupid enough to show an alien invasion where humans are loosing the battle and the super heroes are cracking jokes while battles as if they are playing ping pong. a person playing Call of Duty game is more serious while playing than the marvel heroes fighting aliens."

"Last week some news came out from somebody online who had claimed to have seen a finished version of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. If you were like me, you've been leery of checking it out because you weren't sure how much might actually be true. Now Zack Snyder has spoken out about the spoiler-filled post, although his response doesn't really clear anything up.In a word, to MTV, he called the post \"hilarious,which might imply that he's saying that it's mostly, if not entirely, untrue. That might be the case, but then again he could have just said it was untrue and he didn't say that. What he did say, however, is that he doesn't like spoilers. While this may seem odd for the director who's most recent trailer appeared to give away the entire movie, Snyder says that's not the case. Even if you've seen the trailer, you can rest easy, as there is much more we have not seen in then finished film. Says Snyder I have the benefit of seeing the movie. It's cool that think it's too much, and I appreciate people not wanting to know, but there's plenty that they don't know. There's a lot of movie that's not in the trailer. In the process of calling the Batman v Superman Reddit review hilarious, Snyder goes on to talk about how he hates it when spoilers come out. The director would much rather that fans see the movie mostly blind. While he understands that some fans may wish to find the answers before hand, he wants his movies to be mysteries going in. If you're, as an audience member, exploring these articles, looking for answers to questions that you have, maybe you're okay with knowing before you go. It's like an individual taste. But like I said, I want people to see the movie without knowing.Spoilers are a topic that mean different things to different people. While most try to avoid them to some degree, the need to solve the mystery is a nearly universal human experience. We have an inclination to want to know the truth, even while also wanting to be surprised. For most of us getting some information is good, but getting all the information is bad, of course, only getting the details that you want can be difficult."
"The theatrical is choppy, poorly edited, hard to follow, with some really good moments mixed in their. The extended is much more fluent and is much easier to follow, it does have a long runtime, which might make it seem a bit dragging on, but if you like long films done right, like Lord of the Rings, you will like this movie as long as you get into the characters and story. Speaking of which, the story starts out perfectly showing Bruce Wayne as a character, and it is very powerful. There are several moments in this movie that are powerful, emotional, and shocking. Characters. Batman is my favorite fictional character of all time, and believe me when I say, Ben Affleck as Batman was perfect, he had the charisma, the anger, and the look of being through some bad stuff Gal Gadot also does perfect as Wonder Woman, but if you want to really see how good she does, go watch the Wonder Woman movie. Henry Call as Superman. I really don't like it when people say Christopher Reeves is better. Don't get me wrong, Reeves does great, but can you imagine him as Superman in this movie? I wouldn't like it. It would be like Adam West playing Batman in The Dark Knight. Henry Cavill does great in this role, I can say everything about him as I said with Ben Affleck. Jesse Eisenberg as Luthor. I thought it was different in a good way. I've heard a criticism for him as being too much like Joker, but is that a bad thing? Joker is my favorite villain, so to see Superman have an enemy that crazy, but still hold the values Luthor needs to be Luthor, I think it is great. The thing I thought this movie was lacking in the first and second acts was humor, at least good humor. If there was more humor, I would've given this movie a ten because it would give a more relaxing feel to the parts that needed it. All in all though, this movie was awesome, it had powerful moments, it was badass, and just plain fun. It had a great story arc and does its job very well."

"*I will be talking about the Ultimate Edition of the film* This was one of the most anticipated CBM of all time. Ever since the arrival and subsequent success of Marvel's The Avengers people have wondered when will DC launch its own cinematic universe, one of the main reasons being the opportunity to finally see titans such as Batman and Superman share the screen together: the ultimate nerd dream. On 2016, the moment finally came for BvS to be released AND.. it performed poorly. Not only did critical reception left a lot to be desired, but fan reactions where surprisingly split after its cinematic debut. People either loved it and called Zack a genius, or hated it and called him a hack. Me, personally, I found myself with middle of the road feelings, for sure, but more leaning towards the negative side with subsequent viewings. The theatrical cut of the film showcased amazing performances, incredible visuals, and action set pieces that seemed like comic book panels come to life, in a good way. However, when it comes to its narrative structure and more technical aspects like editing, the film was seriously flawed. More plot holes than Age of Ultron, questionable character decisions, random editing that lacked cohesion and focus, and forced dramatic moments that lacked any impact because the attempts at character development ranged from limited to nonexistent, especially when it comes to Superman's character. I thought it was a 5/10 movie at best. As such, I was kind of skeptical about the idea of a 30 minute longer version. I say kind of because I know how Zack works. I remember Watchmen being vastly improved with its director's cut, so in a way I was expecting BvS to perform in a similar manner, but I also feared those 30 minutes wold be just there to amplify action and discredit storytelling issues. Oh boy, I'm so glad I was proved wrong. The ultimate cut of the film was infuriating, but not because it was awful, but because it questions the sanity of WB executives and editors and makes you wonder what were they thinking during the editing process. What I got out of the Ultimate Edition was a thought-provoking deconstruction of two very iconic superheroes that gave spotlight to the struggles both of them face when they aren't fighting crime. What I got was an extremely well produced character study on both Batman and Superman in a cynical world, a world dangerously close to our own. We meet Batman as a ruthless, worn out hero that has seen the failure behind his ideals and witnessed some truly horrifying things in his life. Superman, on the other hand, is portrayed as a godlike figure that seeks to do good in the world, but finds himself emotionally conflicted once he realized that every good deed he does leaves behind a trail of destruction (most of it due to Luthor's antics). In my opinion, this is a hugely original approach, one that distances itself from the rest of the competition and delivers a dark, somber, yet relevant superhero movie that understands both characters and gives them real human struggles to deal with. I felt invested in both of them, and hoped that by the end of the film both could find a way to redeem themselves. Their character arcs were very well established during the first two acts of the movie, and by the time we get to the titular climactic battle the emotion behind the jaw-dropping action is intensified. Lex Luthor as a villain was also given more time to develop with this new edition. One of the main criticisms with the original version was the fact that his plan relied too much on conveniences, and the character's mannerisms and mad-scientist attitude was annoying, and that goes without saying his motivations were unclear. Not only do we spend more time understanding his hate for any godlike figure and thus his hatred for Superman, but the added scenes allowed us to witness his entire plan come to fruition. It sells the cold, manipulative, calculating attributes of his comic counterpart. The acting is spot on. Every actor owns his/her role, from Cavill's Superman, to Ben Affleck as Batman, Eisenberg as Luthor, and Gadot as Wonder Woman, whose scenes are brief, but are more than enough to sell the strong and ferocious warrior that she is. Cinematography is stunning, and miles above that of Man of Steel's. And the soundtrack by Zimmer and Junkie XL? Perfect, just perfect. When it comes to flaws, the film still has some of those. The Martha moment, while serving as a pivotal character moment for Batman, felt off in execution, and its understandable that many people got mad at it. If your main complaint about BvS the first time around was its bleak tone and subject matter, this film is still not for you. I understand most were expecting to see the heroes being the most iconic versions of themselves, clashing in an elongated battle and evoking the same feelings The Avengers gave audiences back in 2012. In that sense, the film will remain divisive, but at least I have the comfort of saying that, at the very least, the film is competently made."

"This film was amazing. Ben Affleck was easily the best part of this movie, he brought his a-game as Batman. The chemistry between Affleck & Irons was outstanding. Gal Gadot did a great job as Wonder Woman. The fight between Batman & Superman was awesome. The final fight with Doomsday was outstanding in every way possible. However, there is only one problem with this film and that's Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor. He was sadly missed cast in this role, but then again it's really the fault of Warner Bros. Studios. Overall, this film deliver on almost every level. I highly recommend that you watch the extended version of this film."

"I know I know. I saw it in theaters too, and felt like it could've been so much better. While the Batman element was good, the narrative felt fractured, and the third act was just one long stunt scene. Superman was relegated to a supporting character, and other characters didn't get a chance to shine. And then I chanced on the ultimate cut. Calling it 30 mins of \"extra\" footage is unfair to Zack Snyder because it's exactly these 30 mins that makes the movie a worthy one. What I can say about the theatrical cut is this - It had the blockbuster elements - music, visuals, stunts, CGI. But, it lacked the human elements. The first 20 mins of the movie had it, but not after that. The extended cut in comparison has a flow to the narrative. There are no disjointed scenes, everything flows smoothly, and there's connective tissue. Superman gets to spend some time with his father, and mother. Clark Kent does some investigative journalism. Superman helps the people after the blast. Lois Lane doesn't jump to conclusions, she gets to the bottom of the crime. Lex Luthor apparently had a coherent plan - everything is explained pretty well. Wonder Woman was already good, so there's no change there :) Also, the \"Martha\" scene seems better executed, because it is a few seconds longer, and there's time to breathe it in. So, here's my take on this movie - The theatrical cut was junk. Get the Bluray for ultimate edition, and you shall not be disappointed. I've seen it so many more times now, and it's the definitive cut. It is the movie we deserve. It's a unique take on Batman, and Superman. It's a gritty take on the superhero movie genre, and definitely the best DCEU movie, and the best DC movie since The Dark Knight.P.S. Yes it's dark. We're adults, and we should appreciate mature film making without intentionally silly moments. It attempts to be philosophical, and something deep instead of just trying to make you chuckle."

"This is one of the best superhero movies ever made. Zack Snyder is a magician behind the camera.The reason behind so many complaints is the fact that Warner Bros. marketed this movie as a fight between Batman and Superman. That's not what it is. It's a movie about the origins of the Justice League.The cinematography, the acting and the score are all second to none. This film is phenomenal.P.S: watch the 3 hour extended cut that Snyder intended you to see, not the 2 and a half hour movie that Warner Bros. decided would be better for theaters."

"I don't care what the critics say, this is a very well-done movie. I'll start my review by listing what I like about the movie.1.) Ben Affleck is the best batman to me and it is not close. He pulls off the role of an aging batman extremely well. Also, Zack Snyder's vision of batman is legit. I have always hated batman up until this adaptation of him. Instead of being a conflicted and idealistic batman, this batman is dark, gritty, and 100% a badass. His equipment is decked out with machine guns and he has no aversion to killing people. In fact, he probably kills about 50 criminal by the time this movie is over. The warehouse scene is the coolest batman scene in any movie.2.) The development of a grudge between batman and superman is pulled off flawlessly. It actually makes sense why batman dislikes superman. Then, when they do fight it is about the coolest thing you can expect to see from a superhero film. 3.) I disagree with a lot of people about Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor. In my opinion, he played his role to perfection. 4.) B v S sets up Wonder Woman and Justice League with Gal Gadot's cameo as Wonder Woman and short clips of Aquaman, the Flash, and Cyborg. B v S is one of my favorite superhero films and rewatching it never gets old."

"The theatrical cut of this film is garbage which is why I rated it eight stars instead of nine. The first time I watched this film I didn't like it (not straight out hate but didn't like). Character motivations didn't make any sense, Lex was annoying as s***, editing was sloppy, and it was overly dark and broody for an action superhero movie. A year + a half, five Marvel films, a ton of bad reviews and a Justice League later a thought popped into my head: \"what if I watched BVS again\". This time I didn't have trailers ruining the best moments, I only vaguely remembered the film, and I was conditioned to look at it negatively but something unexpected happened: I actually loved it. Superman was just a normal person that tried to make a difference cause he could that others imposed their own beliefs on. Lex Luthor was a genius that couldn't stand his powerlessness compared to Superman or more accurately a super being. As Alfred said \"The fever, the rage, the feeling of powerlessness that turns good men... cruel\" and you see the same thought process in Batman. Batman, just like Lex Luthor feels powerless in the midst of a god-being and just like Lex he attempts to destroy him so he can get his sense of power back but unlike Lex, Batman learns something. I what is one of the corniest lines of the movie Superman says, \"Martha\" when he knows he can't win against Batman in a late desperate attempt to save his mother. Not only does this name connect with Bruce Wayne but it also shows what really matters to a man of steel: it isn't power, it isn't fame or anything else, it is his Mother and on a broader scale it is people. Lex (who doesn't care about people at all) knows he doesn't have the power so he creates something from his blood and the remains of Zod: A Doomsday for Superman. Not only does this film have depth but it also doesn't always explain it to you which is rare in a blockbuster action superhero flick normally cater to semi-comic book fans and people that want to shove popcorn in their mouths. This film rewards you for really noticing the details while still having massive explosions. One of my favorites is how Lex has all of Batman's branded killed which is why he isn't afraid of the branding at the end or Grandma's Peach Tea as a way of scaring the s*** out of someone. Of course, this film isn't perfect and I do have personal dislikes. The Batman V Superman fight was slow and pretty boring especially after watching such an amazing fight in Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 2 (If you haven't watched the animated Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 1 and 2 you are sorely missing out on something fantastic). Also, the addition of Wonder Woman who pretty much steals a hacker thing, gives it back and then suits up and fights against a giant monster thing. Not to say I don't like Wonder Woman (She is one of my favorite Superheroes of all time who showed not only can woman kick a** but they also don't need to be ashamed of their sexuality or gender) but she wasn't really that helpful to the plot and just brought in to expand the universe which was well done through Lex's superhuman hunting files. Also, the post-apocalyptic scene that was just a dream could have been cut but nothing is perfect except movies like Citizen Kane which isn't a lot of fun to watch cause it is too perfect. So to summarize, the theatrical cut is bad, the ultimate cut is Amazing and the other cut is meh. Please give it a second chance because it deserves it and save a good director from losing grace because of something he didn't do."
"I really liked it, don't know what all the hate is about. I'm actually a Marvel fan from when I was 7 or so, but Superman and Batman together in 1 movie? Just great. And personally I like Ben Affleck even better than Christian Bale as Batman. So just watch and enjoy, I know I did!"

"That's right. We have been waiting for these two heroes to finally meet and fight against each other. This movie is so good in both plot and special effects.Henry Cavill and Ben Affleck have performed well in their acting stages. They are the best superhero actors and they have filmed their fighting scenes very well. The movie starts to show the conflict between the lives of the heroes and now they have blamed each other for it. This movie is amazing and sets up a good plot for Dawn Justice."

"Actually...I didn't know what to expect. When you see Wonder Woman, you know it will be off of Wonder Woman and off of a Wonder Woman story, but with Batman V Superman, I was like, \"hmmmm, so who is this about?\" It was pretty obvious that it would feature many characters, but I thought the introduction to Batman was amazing. Ben Affleck nailed the part, not only as Batman but also as Bruce Wayne. He is my Batman. Henry Cavill continued to be super as the Man of Steel. And he is my Super - Man. A dark story? Yes, without a doubt. Could it have had a few more jokes? Sure. But not all movies or stories need to have jokes when certain events are serious. I really hope people can see this review and take another look at the movie, because, I loved it. I really hope the ratings can go up, eventually. And P.S, this movie is the perfect set up to Justice League."

"I'll start by making it clear I have only ever seen the Ultimate Edition. I'm aware of what was cut out for the theatrical release, so I will concede up front that most of the criticisms about pacing, editing, and missing bits of plot at release were merited.With that caveat out of the way, I must reiterate that this was bar-none the boldest superhero movie I have ever seen. To me, it was arguably the best as well, though \"best\" shouldn't be taken to mean \"most enjoyable.\" That honor easily goes to \"Thor: Ragnarok.\" What makes BvS stand out among other films in the genre is that it takes two characters who have been done to death since the 1970s and brings them up to date. I recently tried to watch \"Superman: The Movie\" for the first time in a number of years, and while it was still good and Reeves will always be iconic, I just couldn't take it seriously. I'll put it this way: If the story in BvS was \"stupid\" in your view but Superman turning back time by spinning the earth backward on its axis didn't seem like one of the dumbest things you have ever seen -in any movie from any genre- to the extent that it outright ruins the movie for you, then your opinion about BvS isn't worth much. Nostalgic bias was always going to be a problem for this movie, and the way people reacted to and reviewed \"Man of Steel\" was telling in this regard.That brings me to Zack Snyder's take on Superman. You know, that guy whose status as the first extraterrestrial ever encountered by humanity was a total non-issue in the old movies. Apparently, Snyder has a similar view to my own in that his take on the Man of Steel makes his being an alien a core piece of his identity. He may look like any other (absurdly attractive) person, but he knows what he is, and that makes him perpetually uncertain of where he fits in this world. He is essentially good and really does care about people, but he struggles to truly empathize with the likes of us. To be human is to be frail, and that is not something he can easily relate to. This is the root of his conflict with Batman.Just as Clark struggles to genuinely relate to most people, Snyder's Batman either refuses to or otherwise just can't relate to Superman. He doesn't see him as anything but a threat regardless of Superman's clear good intentions. Remember, a small group of Kryptonians were able to bring humanity to the brink of extinction in less than a day, and Bruce Wayne is nothing if not a realist. He didn't know the guy from Kansas. He only knew the god from another world.While Batman's anger toward and fear of Superman are readily apparent from the start, Superman's inability to imagine things from Bruce Wayne's perspective only becomes truly apparent during their first real interaction. This reminded me of the animated version of the \"world's finest\" storyline, where Superman judges Batman harshly for using fear tactics and threats of violence (also, actual violence) to get the job done. Superman wasn't willing to consider what it would take for a human man to fight criminals and save innocents, or what that life would do to him over time. Just as Batman didn't see the guy from Kansas, Superman didn't see the man who lives his life trapped in one brutal, unthinkably traumatic moment (this was beautifully conveyed during the film's opening moments), and had spent his whole adult life bearing witness to humanity at its absolute worst.The conflict between these two characters is as old as human history. They want the same things, but they can't understand one another. So they fight. And what a fight it was.Watching a fight between, say, Captain America and Iron Man was, to me, more frustrating than anything because each understood the other's perspective perfectly. The fight between Batman and Superman in BvS was genuinely gut-wrenching, as intended, because they would have understood one another if either had tried. The whole sequence hilighted Batman's tactical prowess and ability to control a situation. Maybe the most badass thing about the fight was that it ended exactly where Batman planned. That brings me to the big elephant in the room named \"Martha.\"I can't recall exactly which YouTuber put it this way, but if you thought the \"save Martha\" exchange was about their mothers having the same name, you had your brain turned off. The brain-on people have explained this to death, but it bears repeating. This was the moment when Superman became humanized to Batman. He was about to die, and his only concern was for his adoptive human mother. He still believed that the man about to take his life would do the right thing. Even with the cowl on, there was no mistaking the look on Batman's face. It was the look of shame, guilt, and sudden uncertainty that says \"What am I doing?\" Turns out even the most brutal, angry version of Bruce Wayne is better than Tony Stark at knowing right from wrong. At knowing that he had gone too far.From there, the third act was a series of truly impressive (albeit mostly CGI) fight sequences, beginning with what I regard as the undisputed champion of Batman fights. Nothing in the Nolan movies (and especially nothing in the Burton movies) even came close. Go ahead, try to convince yourself that Batman and Bane taking turns punching one another in the face until Bane's mask broke was a good fight sequence. No, this was a fight straight out of \"Arkham Knight,\" and it was glorious. The battle against Doomsday really was one for the books. From the moment Wonder Woman arrived accompanied by the intense sounds of Tina Guo's electric cello to Superman's tragic, heroic death at the hands of Doomsday, I was glued to the screen. Sure, the mere presence of Doomsday spoiled the end to a degree, but watching the Man of Steel laboring to carry that kryptonite spear towards certain death was no less impactful. A brief word on Jesse Eisenberg's take on Lex Luthor. At least one other reviewer on this site already said it best when they pointed out that this was his origin story. If you consider his scheme objectively, he is actually one of the more formidable incarnations of the character. If we're lucky, we'll eventually get to see a Snyder Cut of \"Justice League\" and find out where this story was actually meant to go. For the record, Joss Whedon and Danny Elfman both should have said \"no\" to taking a dump on someone else's art."
"BATMAN V SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE brings a fantastic surprise to a smash-hit team-up with one of the worlds most beloved DC Comics' icons of all time. The movie delivers spectacular casting, and fantastic acting with different characters having their shine in each scenes.The story follows Clark Kent/Superman who becomes a threat, after the destruction in Metropolis in Man Of Steel.(2013). Batman/Bruce Wayne sees him as a threat and begins his war on Superman.The movie brings spectacular storytelling, it tells the complications of human against alien who are on the same side, and the first meeting of Batman and Superman. The story of Bruce Wayne, with his many years of The Caped Crusader, sends him on a spiral of \"out of control\", sheer anger, and builds tension to wanting to defeat the Man of Steel. Snyder has fantastically gave this storytelling an exciting nod to the comics.Lex Luthor, played by Jesse Einsberg, delivers a very interesting performance, but very differently by him showing is his \"origin\" before he becomes a bald foe to the Man of Steel. He shows that his love of \"god vs man\" terrorises mankind when he ultimately creates Doomsday, and Batman realises Superman's inner heroism.It packs so many great \"out of nowhere\" excitement, including a first-look of the fearful Wonder Woman a.k.a. Diana Prince, played by Gal Gadot, and a fresh-new glimpse of the superhero DC canon: The Justice League.WATCH THIS MOVIE! The critics are out of their mind. It's a fun-packed action adventure which still keeps the movie enjoyable until it's final minutes of the movie. It's a FANTASTIC MOVIE! BEN AFFLECK AS BATMAN... is Incredible!A 10/10 overall!"
"I want to go on record as saying that this is a truly thrilling cinematic experience in so many ways. If pressed, I guess I could acknowledge that there were a couple ... let's say \"clumsy\" moments. And in a film that runs to three hours, that hardly seems like a significant issue, certainly not enough to rate it with fewer than 9 stars.This film has everything. There is dramatic tension right from the start. There is a magnificent story arc that picks up quite seamlessly from 'Man of Steel' and propels the viewer not only into the life of Clark Kent/Superman but also of Bruce Wayne/Batman.The villain is no mere cartoon of a villain; he is truly thoroughly (and apparently irrevocably) diabolical. He is a psychopath, and you wish for his death over and over and over. You want Superman to reduce him to ash with the power of his eyes.I have read a number of viewers' reviews, and it seems that the people who disliked the film / gave it a low rating had rather unfair and unrealistic expectations of it. That is, their own prejudices about how the plot could/should unfold or what the character development could/should be, etc. ruined the film for them. And that is a shame.My thought is: I settle into my seat, wait for the lights to dim, and then I wait to be transported by the film. I accept it, lock, stock, and barrel.As another reviewer remarked, I love how the film begins from the point of view of Bruce Wayne as he is among people on the ground who have fallen victim to the attack of Zod and the other Kryptonians.Why would Bruce Wayne not like Superman? Why would the good people of Earth hurl insults at Superman and burn him in effigy (on the news)? Because the good people of Earth just got catapulted into a new reality in which there are not only extraterrestrial beings (surprise!) but they are also superman! And a group of them are hell-bent on destroying humankind and taking the planet for themselves.It is difficult to see Superman as separate from the whole Kryptonian Krew.It seems that many moviegoers forgot that Bruce Wayne is also human. Sure, he's a hero, but he is flawed.. Just like the rest of us. He is a vigilante, after all.He has let his vigilantism get the better of him. HE is actually the one working outside the boundaries of the law, not Superman. It is the clear head of Alfred that shows us that he has gone into a rather dark place, that he has not seen what is really going on (in Luthor's scheme), and so he chooses to embark on his own scheme scheme to take out the alien invader. He is (allegedly) thinking of the future: if he wipes out the all-powerful alien, then it can't turn on humankind in the future. At least, he convinces himself of that.A philosophical question is raised in the film: should Clark Kent have remained a simple man from Kansas and never have become the Superman? Should he just let people die and let calamities happen? The question is answered for us in the character of Diana Prince/Wonder Woman. She withdrew from mankind (her exact words) and just sat around watching. Watching while people died horrible deaths all around her. So, should Superman have done the same? Do these special beings, these 'metahumans', have some kind of moral imperative to intervene, or should they be allowed to be regular people, too? It seems that humans want it both ways.It seems that humans are saying: \"Don't be a superalien ... except when I and my friends and family are in trouble. Then come save us.\""

"Batman v Superman: Ultimate Edition: If your looking for a quick, cheap thrill then you might not enjoy this film at the time. This movies theatrical version was butchered by WB and in doing so reshaped the story leaving numerous plot holes. So the Ultimate Edition is the full story and the one worth seeing. Watch 'Man of Steel' before seeing this movie. There is much to claw through here, so much so that the audience might easily find themselves exhausted from the overall aggression of the film. However, a lot of the story does work. The action is good, and the emotion feels real most of the time.This film is about Superman trying to become Superman. Trying to help the world, save people, find a place in this world not as an outcast, and yet is looked at has a threat by many. Superman is not from this world, yet He is trying to be human, find a place in this world, be excepted by earths people, and come into his destiny.This film is also about Batman being Batman for 20 years and losing faith in humanity, and fearing Superman, what Superman can do with his powers. Great film, great plot, great visuals. ---Yidioo"
"I didn't see the film in the theaters and just bought the \"Extended Edition \" on Amazon. I never properly saw Man of Steel- i think I rented it and watched it when already exhausted and fell asleep. I saw the mediocre user reviews and horrible reviews from critics of this film.They really have it wrong. This is the very best either Batman or Superman. It has a different take, on things. Much darker then earlier films even darker then the Christopher Nolan Batman films.First of all Christopher Nolan is an Executive Producer. So how bad could it be? I loved Sucker Punch and Zack Snyder was involved with that. So how bad could this be? Hans Zimmer did the music, so how bad could it be?I remember watching the old Superman TV shows and reading the Superman and Batman comics as a little kid and loved them, but i wouldn't call myself a \"fan boy\" of comic universes, like so many younger people today. As an older adult I will admit my favorite TV show of all time was Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but watched it on DVD only after it had finished. I saw the second of the Dark Knight series in the theater, but the other two, I watched on DVD. They were great, but not my favorite films like so many people. i also loved the first couple Superman and Batman films in the older series. Regardless, i was not waiting with baited breath to see Man of Steel or this one.I'm more of a serious film fan, who can watch Stanley Kubrick films over and over and my favorite films in the last twenty years, are Eyes Wide Shut and Intersteller, both of which i've watched multiple times.So, with that said, take it from me, the critics have this film very wrong, just as critics hated 2001: A Space Odyssey when it first came out. This film will have lasting appreciation.Surprised how much I liked Ben Afleck's Batman. it was hard to get into Henry Cavil's scrawnier looking Superman, but it grew on me. Amy Adams was great as Lois Lane, The Gal Gadol Wonder Women was amazing. Lex Luther was terrific, like Nolan's Joker. Jeremy Irons was the best Alfred ever. Holly Hunter and Diane Lane was good too. The movie had bad reviews but made a billion dollars. Hopefully everyone buys the Ultimate Edition and it breaks sales records and the film is re-appreciated. I have no idea what scenes this Ultimate Edition added, but it is pretty perfect. Now I can't wait for Wonder Woman and the Justice League and as soon as I finish writing this am going to watch Man of Steal. I'm into it now!I can only surmise that the bad reviews stem from too much expectations of the rigid fan boy types and the radical changes in tone, we see in this film.Total masterpiece of cinema, but I have a few criticisms. There are a few hollow scenes of typical Idiot cops and authorities getting everything wrong in a cliché type way and it has a few filler scenes of that type and a few moments here and there that felt rushed and cheesy. Maybe not everything restored into the Ultimate Edition should have been. I wish there had been more Kevin Costner scenes."

"The whole entire Batman V Superman movie was great and yes even though it felt slow to the majority of the people who watched it but to me I enjoyed every part and every scene of Batman V Superman and when it got to the fight scenes both batman VS Superman and the Doomsday fight it brought so much drama, intensity, and epic performances. So with that being said I give this movie a good 10/10 because it really did go to my expectations and it brought a powerful performance and a powerful yet epic introduction to the upcoming Justice League."

"Zack Snyder not only understands the characters but he also understands how to craft a real amazing movie for fans - honestly blew me away (extended cut) Brilliant!Don't believe what the internet is telling you to think - take this from a person who has worked in the comic book industry - this is amazing!"

"When I first wrote a review for this movie a year ago exclaiming my excitement for the film, I had been high off a fresh dose of live-action DC superheroes playing out the beloved comic book stories that I had grown up on. It was all playing out before my eyes and coming to life. After a few months had passed, I began to notice things about the movie that I disliked: little gaps in the story, things that didn't add up, etc. My original rating of a 10 / 10 dropped to an 8 /10. But today it has gone back up to a 10. The extended version of the film not only rectifies the gaps but also silences critics.Many claimed that the movie was too dark or that it just didn't make sense. To those people, I say: \"Pick up a comic book!\" Many of the critics of this particular film were part of the superhero bandwagon that formed when Marvel began its spree of Avengers-related films. In fact, its estimated that over 60% of people who go to see 'superhero' genre films have never picked up a comic book in their life. I would argue that similar numbers could figure to those which view the CW televised DC Universe shows. People complain that DC comics is just too dark but the fact is that these movies are based upon actual comics which are meant to be dark (ex: The Dark Knight Returns, Injustice, etc.). Its like complaining that Game of Thrones (the TV series) sucks because they kill off too many characters. Read the books! Its frustrating to see such a beautiful work of art like Batman V Superman criticized by those ignorant to its universe and its meaning. This movie is in fact a catalyst that opens numerous doorways and leaves true fans in awe of the possibilities for future movies. But regardless of whether or not people choose to educate themselves, this film's DVD/Blu-ray extended version puts the theater release to shame. All of the plot holes and gaps are filled in 30 minutes of extended footage scattered throughout the film. The movie ultimately becomes more complete and people will wish that the movie had shown the full 3 hours of footage in its theatrical debut. As a major DC comics fan, I will of course pick up on things that a comics fan would not, but someone who does not read comics would learn to appreciate this film in its entirety with the extended version. Get your hands on a copy today or find it on Netflix or the internet somewhere!"

"I ignored the bad reviews and watched anyways. This film had a lot to live up to after Civil War was released and I went into this film expecting the worst. It ended up to be the best Superhero film of 2016 to me. One complaint was that this film was more concerned about universe building than telling a great story than Civil War but for me it was the other way around; Civil War felt like a build up to something else and to be honest, I felt that way when I saw the other MCU films. Batman vs Superman however not only had a great story, but it also felt a lot more consistent than Civil War. This film was way more diverse with the cast than the MCU but unlike the MCU, I felt like this film doesn't go overboard with the SJW stuff like the MCU films or The Star Wars Sequel films do. The Visuals were AMAZING, The Score by Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL was AMAZING as well, The Tone is just right as I actually felt for the characters emotionally, The Cinematography kept my eyes glued to the screen, and the script felt really Intelligent and Complex and despite people calling the writing confusing, I was able to piece it together with no problem whatsoever. This film is similar to Empire Strikes back in terms of popularity so over time after the other movies are released, this movie would probably be more popular.This film was way better than I Expected and deserves another chance.

"Its shame to see what critics and marvel fans did to this movie and targeted Zack Snyder for it. I have seen this movie more than 25 times till date. And i enjoy this movie as much as i enjoyed the first time. The fans who have read DC comics, wouldn't be disappointed in this movie. Its dark movie, yes it is. Because the title shows the intense situation at hand. Two superheroes about to rip each other apart for whatever reasons that brought them to this stage. Yes it had to be dark and intense.Only marvel can be stupid enough to show an alien invasion where humans are loosing the battle and the super heroes are cracking jokes while battles as if they are playing ping pong. a person playing Call of Duty game is more serious while playing than the marvel heroes fighting aliens."

"Last week some news came out from somebody online who had claimed to have seen a finished version of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. If you were like me, you've been leery of checking it out because you weren't sure how much might actually be true. Now Zack Snyder has spoken out about the spoiler-filled post, although his response doesn't really clear anything up.In a word, to MTV, he called the post \"hilarious,which might imply that he's saying that it's mostly, if not entirely, untrue. That might be the case, but then again he could have just said it was untrue and he didn't say that. What he did say, however, is that he doesn't like spoilers. While this may seem odd for the director who's most recent trailer appeared to give away the entire movie, Snyder says that's not the case. Even if you've seen the trailer, you can rest easy, as there is much more we have not seen in then finished film. Says Snyder I have the benefit of seeing the movie. It's cool that think it's too much, and I appreciate people not wanting to know, but there's plenty that they don't know. There's a lot of movie that's not in the trailer. In the process of calling the Batman v Superman Reddit review hilarious, Snyder goes on to talk about how he hates it when spoilers come out. The director would much rather that fans see the movie mostly blind. While he understands that some fans may wish to find the answers before hand, he wants his movies to be mysteries going in. If you're, as an audience member, exploring these articles, looking for answers to questions that you have, maybe you're okay with knowing before you go. It's like an individual taste. But like I said, I want people to see the movie without knowing.Spoilers are a topic that mean different things to different people. While most try to avoid them to some degree, the need to solve the mystery is a nearly universal human experience. We have an inclination to want to know the truth, even while also wanting to be surprised. For most of us getting some information is good, but getting all the information is bad, of course, only getting the details that you want can be difficult."
"The theatrical is choppy, poorly edited, hard to follow, with some really good moments mixed in their. The extended is much more fluent and is much easier to follow, it does have a long runtime, which might make it seem a bit dragging on, but if you like long films done right, like Lord of the Rings, you will like this movie as long as you get into the characters and story. Speaking of which, the story starts out perfectly showing Bruce Wayne as a character, and it is very powerful. There are several moments in this movie that are powerful, emotional, and shocking. Characters. Batman is my favorite fictional character of all time, and believe me when I say, Ben Affleck as Batman was perfect, he had the charisma, the anger, and the look of being through some bad stuff Gal Gadot also does perfect as Wonder Woman, but if you want to really see how good she does, go watch the Wonder Woman movie. Henry Call as Superman. I really don't like it when people say Christopher Reeves is better. Don't get me wrong, Reeves does great, but can you imagine him as Superman in this movie? I wouldn't like it. It would be like Adam West playing Batman in The Dark Knight. Henry Cavill does great in this role, I can say everything about him as I said with Ben Affleck. Jesse Eisenberg as Luthor. I thought it was different in a good way. I've heard a criticism for him as being too much like Joker, but is that a bad thing? Joker is my favorite villain, so to see Superman have an enemy that crazy, but still hold the values Luthor needs to be Luthor, I think it is great. The thing I thought this movie was lacking in the first and second acts was humor, at least good humor. If there was more humor, I would've given this movie a ten because it would give a more relaxing feel to the parts that needed it. All in all though, this movie was awesome, it had powerful moments, it was badass, and just plain fun. It had a great story arc and does its job very well."

"*I will be talking about the Ultimate Edition of the film* This was one of the most anticipated CBM of all time. Ever since the arrival and subsequent success of Marvel's The Avengers people have wondered when will DC launch its own cinematic universe, one of the main reasons being the opportunity to finally see titans such as Batman and Superman share the screen together: the ultimate nerd dream. On 2016, the moment finally came for BvS to be released AND.. it performed poorly. Not only did critical reception left a lot to be desired, but fan reactions where surprisingly split after its cinematic debut. People either loved it and called Zack a genius, or hated it and called him a hack. Me, personally, I found myself with middle of the road feelings, for sure, but more leaning towards the negative side with subsequent viewings. The theatrical cut of the film showcased amazing performances, incredible visuals, and action set pieces that seemed like comic book panels come to life, in a good way. However, when it comes to its narrative structure and more technical aspects like editing, the film was seriously flawed. More plot holes than Age of Ultron, questionable character decisions, random editing that lacked cohesion and focus, and forced dramatic moments that lacked any impact because the attempts at character development ranged from limited to nonexistent, especially when it comes to Superman's character. I thought it was a 5/10 movie at best. As such, I was kind of skeptical about the idea of a 30 minute longer version. I say kind of because I know how Zack works. I remember Watchmen being vastly improved with its director's cut, so in a way I was expecting BvS to perform in a similar manner, but I also feared those 30 minutes wold be just there to amplify action and discredit storytelling issues. Oh boy, I'm so glad I was proved wrong. The ultimate cut of the film was infuriating, but not because it was awful, but because it questions the sanity of WB executives and editors and makes you wonder what were they thinking during the editing process. What I got out of the Ultimate Edition was a thought-provoking deconstruction of two very iconic superheroes that gave spotlight to the struggles both of them face when they aren't fighting crime. What I got was an extremely well produced character study on both Batman and Superman in a cynical world, a world dangerously close to our own. We meet Batman as a ruthless, worn out hero that has seen the failure behind his ideals and witnessed some truly horrifying things in his life. Superman, on the other hand, is portrayed as a godlike figure that seeks to do good in the world, but finds himself emotionally conflicted once he realized that every good deed he does leaves behind a trail of destruction (most of it due to Luthor's antics). In my opinion, this is a hugely original approach, one that distances itself from the rest of the competition and delivers a dark, somber, yet relevant superhero movie that understands both characters and gives them real human struggles to deal with. I felt invested in both of them, and hoped that by the end of the film both could find a way to redeem themselves. Their character arcs were very well established during the first two acts of the movie, and by the time we get to the titular climactic battle the emotion behind the jaw-dropping action is intensified. Lex Luthor as a villain was also given more time to develop with this new edition. One of the main criticisms with the original version was the fact that his plan relied too much on conveniences, and the character's mannerisms and mad-scientist attitude was annoying, and that goes without saying his motivations were unclear. Not only do we spend more time understanding his hate for any godlike figure and thus his hatred for Superman, but the added scenes allowed us to witness his entire plan come to fruition. It sells the cold, manipulative, calculating attributes of his comic counterpart. The acting is spot on. Every actor owns his/her role, from Cavill's Superman, to Ben Affleck as Batman, Eisenberg as Luthor, and Gadot as Wonder Woman, whose scenes are brief, but are more than enough to sell the strong and ferocious warrior that she is. Cinematography is stunning, and miles above that of Man of Steel's. And the soundtrack by Zimmer and Junkie XL? Perfect, just perfect. When it comes to flaws, the film still has some of those. The Martha moment, while serving as a pivotal character moment for Batman, felt off in execution, and its understandable that many people got mad at it. If your main complaint about BvS the first time around was its bleak tone and subject matter, this film is still not for you. I understand most were expecting to see the heroes being the most iconic versions of themselves, clashing in an elongated battle and evoking the same feelings The Avengers gave audiences back in 2012. In that sense, the film will remain divisive, but at least I have the comfort of saying that, at the very least, the film is competently made."

"This film was amazing. Ben Affleck was easily the best part of this movie, he brought his a-game as Batman. The chemistry between Affleck & Irons was outstanding. Gal Gadot did a great job as Wonder Woman. The fight between Batman & Superman was awesome. The final fight with Doomsday was outstanding in every way possible. However, there is only one problem with this film and that's Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor. He was sadly missed cast in this role, but then again it's really the fault of Warner Bros. Studios. Overall, this film deliver on almost every level. I highly recommend that you watch the extended version of this film."

"I know I know. I saw it in theaters too, and felt like it could've been so much better. While the Batman element was good, the narrative felt fractured, and the third act was just one long stunt scene. Superman was relegated to a supporting character, and other characters didn't get a chance to shine. And then I chanced on the ultimate cut. Calling it 30 mins of \"extra\" footage is unfair to Zack Snyder because it's exactly these 30 mins that makes the movie a worthy one. What I can say about the theatrical cut is this - It had the blockbuster elements - music, visuals, stunts, CGI. But, it lacked the human elements. The first 20 mins of the movie had it, but not after that. The extended cut in comparison has a flow to the narrative. There are no disjointed scenes, everything flows smoothly, and there's connective tissue. Superman gets to spend some time with his father, and mother. Clark Kent does some investigative journalism. Superman helps the people after the blast. Lois Lane doesn't jump to conclusions, she gets to the bottom of the crime. Lex Luthor apparently had a coherent plan - everything is explained pretty well. Wonder Woman was already good, so there's no change there :) Also, the \"Martha\" scene seems better executed, because it is a few seconds longer, and there's time to breathe it in. So, here's my take on this movie - The theatrical cut was junk. Get the Bluray for ultimate edition, and you shall not be disappointed. I've seen it so many more times now, and it's the definitive cut. It is the movie we deserve. It's a unique take on Batman, and Superman. It's a gritty take on the superhero movie genre, and definitely the best DCEU movie, and the best DC movie since The Dark Knight.P.S. Yes it's dark. We're adults, and we should appreciate mature film making without intentionally silly moments. It attempts to be philosophical, and something deep instead of just trying to make you chuckle."

"This is one of the best superhero movies ever made. Zack Snyder is a magician behind the camera.The reason behind so many complaints is the fact that Warner Bros. marketed this movie as a fight between Batman and Superman. That's not what it is. It's a movie about the origins of the Justice League.The cinematography, the acting and the score are all second to none. This film is phenomenal.P.S: watch the 3 hour extended cut that Snyder intended you to see, not the 2 and a half hour movie that Warner Bros. decided would be better for theaters."

"I don't care what the critics say, this is a very well-done movie. I'll start my review by listing what I like about the movie.1.) Ben Affleck is the best batman to me and it is not close. He pulls off the role of an aging batman extremely well. Also, Zack Snyder's vision of batman is legit. I have always hated batman up until this adaptation of him. Instead of being a conflicted and idealistic batman, this batman is dark, gritty, and 100% a badass. His equipment is decked out with machine guns and he has no aversion to killing people. In fact, he probably kills about 50 criminal by the time this movie is over. The warehouse scene is the coolest batman scene in any movie.2.) The development of a grudge between batman and superman is pulled off flawlessly. It actually makes sense why batman dislikes superman. Then, when they do fight it is about the coolest thing you can expect to see from a superhero film. 3.) I disagree with a lot of people about Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor. In my opinion, he played his role to perfection. 4.) B v S sets up Wonder Woman and Justice League with Gal Gadot's cameo as Wonder Woman and short clips of Aquaman, the Flash, and Cyborg. B v S is one of my favorite superhero films and rewatching it never gets old."

"The theatrical cut of this film is garbage which is why I rated it eight stars instead of nine. The first time I watched this film I didn't like it (not straight out hate but didn't like). Character motivations didn't make any sense, Lex was annoying as s***, editing was sloppy, and it was overly dark and broody for an action superhero movie. A year + a half, five Marvel films, a ton of bad reviews and a Justice League later a thought popped into my head: \"what if I watched BVS again\". This time I didn't have trailers ruining the best moments, I only vaguely remembered the film, and I was conditioned to look at it negatively but something unexpected happened: I actually loved it. Superman was just a normal person that tried to make a difference cause he could that others imposed their own beliefs on. Lex Luthor was a genius that couldn't stand his powerlessness compared to Superman or more accurately a super being. As Alfred said \"The fever, the rage, the feeling of powerlessness that turns good men... cruel\" and you see the same thought process in Batman. Batman, just like Lex Luthor feels powerless in the midst of a god-being and just like Lex he attempts to destroy him so he can get his sense of power back but unlike Lex, Batman learns something. I what is one of the corniest lines of the movie Superman says, \"Martha\" when he knows he can't win against Batman in a late desperate attempt to save his mother. Not only does this name connect with Bruce Wayne but it also shows what really matters to a man of steel: it isn't power, it isn't fame or anything else, it is his Mother and on a broader scale it is people. Lex (who doesn't care about people at all) knows he doesn't have the power so he creates something from his blood and the remains of Zod: A Doomsday for Superman. Not only does this film have depth but it also doesn't always explain it to you which is rare in a blockbuster action superhero flick normally cater to semi-comic book fans and people that want to shove popcorn in their mouths. This film rewards you for really noticing the details while still having massive explosions. One of my favorites is how Lex has all of Batman's branded killed which is why he isn't afraid of the branding at the end or Grandma's Peach Tea as a way of scaring the s*** out of someone. Of course, this film isn't perfect and I do have personal dislikes. The Batman V Superman fight was slow and pretty boring especially after watching such an amazing fight in Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 2 (If you haven't watched the animated Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 1 and 2 you are sorely missing out on something fantastic). Also, the addition of Wonder Woman who pretty much steals a hacker thing, gives it back and then suits up and fights against a giant monster thing. Not to say I don't like Wonder Woman (She is one of my favorite Superheroes of all time who showed not only can woman kick a** but they also don't need to be ashamed of their sexuality or gender) but she wasn't really that helpful to the plot and just brought in to expand the universe which was well done through Lex's superhuman hunting files. Also, the post-apocalyptic scene that was just a dream could have been cut but nothing is perfect except movies like Citizen Kane which isn't a lot of fun to watch cause it is too perfect. So to summarize, the theatrical cut is bad, the ultimate cut is Amazing and the other cut is meh. Please give it a second chance because it deserves it and save a good director from losing grace because of something he didn't do."
"I really liked it, don't know what all the hate is about. I'm actually a Marvel fan from when I was 7 or so, but Superman and Batman together in 1 movie? Just great. And personally I like Ben Affleck even better than Christian Bale as Batman. So just watch and enjoy, I know I did!"

"That's right. We have been waiting for these two heroes to finally meet and fight against each other. This movie is so good in both plot and special effects.Henry Cavill and Ben Affleck have performed well in their acting stages. They are the best superhero actors and they have filmed their fighting scenes very well. The movie starts to show the conflict between the lives of the heroes and now they have blamed each other for it. This movie is amazing and sets up a good plot for Dawn Justice."

"Actually...I didn't know what to expect. When you see Wonder Woman, you know it will be off of Wonder Woman and off of a Wonder Woman story, but with Batman V Superman, I was like, \"hmmmm, so who is this about?\" It was pretty obvious that it would feature many characters, but I thought the introduction to Batman was amazing. Ben Affleck nailed the part, not only as Batman but also as Bruce Wayne. He is my Batman. Henry Cavill continued to be super as the Man of Steel. And he is my Super - Man. A dark story? Yes, without a doubt. Could it have had a few more jokes? Sure. But not all movies or stories need to have jokes when certain events are serious. I really hope people can see this review and take another look at the movie, because, I loved it. I really hope the ratings can go up, eventually. And P.S, this movie is the perfect set up to Justice League."

"I'll start by making it clear I have only ever seen the Ultimate Edition. I'm aware of what was cut out for the theatrical release, so I will concede up front that most of the criticisms about pacing, editing, and missing bits of plot at release were merited.With that caveat out of the way, I must reiterate that this was bar-none the boldest superhero movie I have ever seen. To me, it was arguably the best as well, though \"best\" shouldn't be taken to mean \"most enjoyable.\" That honor easily goes to \"Thor: Ragnarok.\" What makes BvS stand out among other films in the genre is that it takes two characters who have been done to death since the 1970s and brings them up to date. I recently tried to watch \"Superman: The Movie\" for the first time in a number of years, and while it was still good and Reeves will always be iconic, I just couldn't take it seriously. I'll put it this way: If the story in BvS was \"stupid\" in your view but Superman turning back time by spinning the earth backward on its axis didn't seem like one of the dumbest things you have ever seen -in any movie from any genre- to the extent that it outright ruins the movie for you, then your opinion about BvS isn't worth much. Nostalgic bias was always going to be a problem for this movie, and the way people reacted to and reviewed \"Man of Steel\" was telling in this regard.That brings me to Zack Snyder's take on Superman. You know, that guy whose status as the first extraterrestrial ever encountered by humanity was a total non-issue in the old movies. Apparently, Snyder has a similar view to my own in that his take on the Man of Steel makes his being an alien a core piece of his identity. He may look like any other (absurdly attractive) person, but he knows what he is, and that makes him perpetually uncertain of where he fits in this world. He is essentially good and really does care about people, but he struggles to truly empathize with the likes of us. To be human is to be frail, and that is not something he can easily relate to. This is the root of his conflict with Batman.Just as Clark struggles to genuinely relate to most people, Snyder's Batman either refuses to or otherwise just can't relate to Superman. He doesn't see him as anything but a threat regardless of Superman's clear good intentions. Remember, a small group of Kryptonians were able to bring humanity to the brink of extinction in less than a day, and Bruce Wayne is nothing if not a realist. He didn't know the guy from Kansas. He only knew the god from another world.While Batman's anger toward and fear of Superman are readily apparent from the start, Superman's inability to imagine things from Bruce Wayne's perspective only becomes truly apparent during their first real interaction. This reminded me of the animated version of the \"world's finest\" storyline, where Superman judges Batman harshly for using fear tactics and threats of violence (also, actual violence) to get the job done. Superman wasn't willing to consider what it would take for a human man to fight criminals and save innocents, or what that life would do to him over time. Just as Batman didn't see the guy from Kansas, Superman didn't see the man who lives his life trapped in one brutal, unthinkably traumatic moment (this was beautifully conveyed during the film's opening moments), and had spent his whole adult life bearing witness to humanity at its absolute worst.The conflict between these two characters is as old as human history. They want the same things, but they can't understand one another. So they fight. And what a fight it was.Watching a fight between, say, Captain America and Iron Man was, to me, more frustrating than anything because each understood the other's perspective perfectly. The fight between Batman and Superman in BvS was genuinely gut-wrenching, as intended, because they would have understood one another if either had tried. The whole sequence hilighted Batman's tactical prowess and ability to control a situation. Maybe the most badass thing about the fight was that it ended exactly where Batman planned. That brings me to the big elephant in the room named \"Martha.\"I can't recall exactly which YouTuber put it this way, but if you thought the \"save Martha\" exchange was about their mothers having the same name, you had your brain turned off. The brain-on people have explained this to death, but it bears repeating. This was the moment when Superman became humanized to Batman. He was about to die, and his only concern was for his adoptive human mother. He still believed that the man about to take his life would do the right thing. Even with the cowl on, there was no mistaking the look on Batman's face. It was the look of shame, guilt, and sudden uncertainty that says \"What am I doing?\" Turns out even the most brutal, angry version of Bruce Wayne is better than Tony Stark at knowing right from wrong. At knowing that he had gone too far.From there, the third act was a series of truly impressive (albeit mostly CGI) fight sequences, beginning with what I regard as the undisputed champion of Batman fights. Nothing in the Nolan movies (and especially nothing in the Burton movies) even came close. Go ahead, try to convince yourself that Batman and Bane taking turns punching one another in the face until Bane's mask broke was a good fight sequence. No, this was a fight straight out of \"Arkham Knight,\" and it was glorious. The battle against Doomsday really was one for the books. From the moment Wonder Woman arrived accompanied by the intense sounds of Tina Guo's electric cello to Superman's tragic, heroic death at the hands of Doomsday, I was glued to the screen. Sure, the mere presence of Doomsday spoiled the end to a degree, but watching the Man of Steel laboring to carry that kryptonite spear towards certain death was no less impactful. A brief word on Jesse Eisenberg's take on Lex Luthor. At least one other reviewer on this site already said it best when they pointed out that this was his origin story. If you consider his scheme objectively, he is actually one of the more formidable incarnations of the character. If we're lucky, we'll eventually get to see a Snyder Cut of \"Justice League\" and find out where this story was actually meant to go. For the record, Joss Whedon and Danny Elfman both should have said \"no\" to taking a dump on someone else's art."
"BATMAN V SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE brings a fantastic surprise to a smash-hit team-up with one of the worlds most beloved DC Comics' icons of all time. The movie delivers spectacular casting, and fantastic acting with different characters having their shine in each scenes.The story follows Clark Kent/Superman who becomes a threat, after the destruction in Metropolis in Man Of Steel.(2013). Batman/Bruce Wayne sees him as a threat and begins his war on Superman.The movie brings spectacular storytelling, it tells the complications of human against alien who are on the same side, and the first meeting of Batman and Superman. The story of Bruce Wayne, with his many years of The Caped Crusader, sends him on a spiral of \"out of control\", sheer anger, and builds tension to wanting to defeat the Man of Steel. Snyder has fantastically gave this storytelling an exciting nod to the comics.Lex Luthor, played by Jesse Einsberg, delivers a very interesting performance, but very differently by him showing is his \"origin\" before he becomes a bald foe to the Man of Steel. He shows that his love of \"god vs man\" terrorises mankind when he ultimately creates Doomsday, and Batman realises Superman's inner heroism.It packs so many great \"out of nowhere\" excitement, including a first-look of the fearful Wonder Woman a.k.a. Diana Prince, played by Gal Gadot, and a fresh-new glimpse of the superhero DC canon: The Justice League.WATCH THIS MOVIE! The critics are out of their mind. It's a fun-packed action adventure which still keeps the movie enjoyable until it's final minutes of the movie. It's a FANTASTIC MOVIE! BEN AFFLECK AS BATMAN... is Incredible!A 10/10 overall!"
"I want to go on record as saying that this is a truly thrilling cinematic experience in so many ways. If pressed, I guess I could acknowledge that there were a couple ... let's say \"clumsy\" moments. And in a film that runs to three hours, that hardly seems like a significant issue, certainly not enough to rate it with fewer than 9 stars.This film has everything. There is dramatic tension right from the start. There is a magnificent story arc that picks up quite seamlessly from 'Man of Steel' and propels the viewer not only into the life of Clark Kent/Superman but also of Bruce Wayne/Batman.The villain is no mere cartoon of a villain; he is truly thoroughly (and apparently irrevocably) diabolical. He is a psychopath, and you wish for his death over and over and over. You want Superman to reduce him to ash with the power of his eyes.I have read a number of viewers' reviews, and it seems that the people who disliked the film / gave it a low rating had rather unfair and unrealistic expectations of it. That is, their own prejudices about how the plot could/should unfold or what the character development could/should be, etc. ruined the film for them. And that is a shame.My thought is: I settle into my seat, wait for the lights to dim, and then I wait to be transported by the film. I accept it, lock, stock, and barrel.As another reviewer remarked, I love how the film begins from the point of view of Bruce Wayne as he is among people on the ground who have fallen victim to the attack of Zod and the other Kryptonians.Why would Bruce Wayne not like Superman? Why would the good people of Earth hurl insults at Superman and burn him in effigy (on the news)? Because the good people of Earth just got catapulted into a new reality in which there are not only extraterrestrial beings (surprise!) but they are also superman! And a group of them are hell-bent on destroying humankind and taking the planet for themselves.It is difficult to see Superman as separate from the whole Kryptonian Krew.It seems that many moviegoers forgot that Bruce Wayne is also human. Sure, he's a hero, but he is flawed.. Just like the rest of us. He is a vigilante, after all.He has let his vigilantism get the better of him. HE is actually the one working outside the boundaries of the law, not Superman. It is the clear head of Alfred that shows us that he has gone into a rather dark place, that he has not seen what is really going on (in Luthor's scheme), and so he chooses to embark on his own scheme scheme to take out the alien invader. He is (allegedly) thinking of the future: if he wipes out the all-powerful alien, then it can't turn on humankind in the future. At least, he convinces himself of that.A philosophical question is raised in the film: should Clark Kent have remained a simple man from Kansas and never have become the Superman? Should he just let people die and let calamities happen? The question is answered for us in the character of Diana Prince/Wonder Woman. She withdrew from mankind (her exact words) and just sat around watching. Watching while people died horrible deaths all around her. So, should Superman have done the same? Do these special beings, these 'metahumans', have some kind of moral imperative to intervene, or should they be allowed to be regular people, too? It seems that humans want it both ways.It seems that humans are saying: \"Don't be a superalien ... except when I and my friends and family are in trouble. Then come save us.\""

"Batman v Superman: Ultimate Edition: If your looking for a quick, cheap thrill then you might not enjoy this film at the time. This movies theatrical version was butchered by WB and in doing so reshaped the story leaving numerous plot holes. So the Ultimate Edition is the full story and the one worth seeing. Watch 'Man of Steel' before seeing this movie. There is much to claw through here, so much so that the audience might easily find themselves exhausted from the overall aggression of the film. However, a lot of the story does work. The action is good, and the emotion feels real most of the time.This film is about Superman trying to become Superman. Trying to help the world, save people, find a place in this world not as an outcast, and yet is looked at has a threat by many. Superman is not from this world, yet He is trying to be human, find a place in this world, be excepted by earths people, and come into his destiny.This film is also about Batman being Batman for 20 years and losing faith in humanity, and fearing Superman, what Superman can do with his powers. Great film, great plot, great visuals. ---Yidioo"
"I didn't see the film in the theaters and just bought the \"Extended Edition \" on Amazon. I never properly saw Man of Steel- i think I rented it and watched it when already exhausted and fell asleep. I saw the mediocre user reviews and horrible reviews from critics of this film.They really have it wrong. This is the very best either Batman or Superman. It has a different take, on things. Much darker then earlier films even darker then the Christopher Nolan Batman films.First of all Christopher Nolan is an Executive Producer. So how bad could it be? I loved Sucker Punch and Zack Snyder was involved with that. So how bad could this be? Hans Zimmer did the music, so how bad could it be?I remember watching the old Superman TV shows and reading the Superman and Batman comics as a little kid and loved them, but i wouldn't call myself a \"fan boy\" of comic universes, like so many younger people today. As an older adult I will admit my favorite TV show of all time was Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but watched it on DVD only after it had finished. I saw the second of the Dark Knight series in the theater, but the other two, I watched on DVD. They were great, but not my favorite films like so many people. i also loved the first couple Superman and Batman films in the older series. Regardless, i was not waiting with baited breath to see Man of Steel or this one.I'm more of a serious film fan, who can watch Stanley Kubrick films over and over and my favorite films in the last twenty years, are Eyes Wide Shut and Intersteller, both of which i've watched multiple times.So, with that said, take it from me, the critics have this film very wrong, just as critics hated 2001: A Space Odyssey when it first came out. This film will have lasting appreciation.Surprised how much I liked Ben Afleck's Batman. it was hard to get into Henry Cavil's scrawnier looking Superman, but it grew on me. Amy Adams was great as Lois Lane, The Gal Gadol Wonder Women was amazing. Lex Luther was terrific, like Nolan's Joker. Jeremy Irons was the best Alfred ever. Holly Hunter and Diane Lane was good too. The movie had bad reviews but made a billion dollars. Hopefully everyone buys the Ultimate Edition and it breaks sales records and the film is re-appreciated. I have no idea what scenes this Ultimate Edition added, but it is pretty perfect. Now I can't wait for Wonder Woman and the Justice League and as soon as I finish writing this am going to watch Man of Steal. I'm into it now!I can only surmise that the bad reviews stem from too much expectations of the rigid fan boy types and the radical changes in tone, we see in this film.Total masterpiece of cinema, but I have a few criticisms. There are a few hollow scenes of typical Idiot cops and authorities getting everything wrong in a cliché type way and it has a few filler scenes of that type and a few moments here and there that felt rushed and cheesy. Maybe not everything restored into the Ultimate Edition should have been. I wish there had been more Kevin Costner scenes."

"The whole entire Batman V Superman movie was great and yes even though it felt slow to the majority of the people who watched it but to me I enjoyed every part and every scene of Batman V Superman and when it got to the fight scenes both batman VS Superman and the Doomsday fight it brought so much drama, intensity, and epic performances. So with that being said I give this movie a good 10/10 because it really did go to my expectations and it brought a powerful performance and a powerful yet epic introduction to the upcoming Justice League."

"Zack Snyder not only understands the characters but he also understands how to craft a real amazing movie for fans - honestly blew me away (extended cut) Brilliant!Don't believe what the internet is telling you to think - take this from a person who has worked in the comic book industry - this is amazing!"

"When I first wrote a review for this movie a year ago exclaiming my excitement for the film, I had been high off a fresh dose of live-action DC superheroes playing out the beloved comic book stories that I had grown up on. It was all playing out before my eyes and coming to life. After a few months had passed, I began to notice things about the movie that I disliked: little gaps in the story, things that didn't add up, etc. My original rating of a 10 / 10 dropped to an 8 /10. But today it has gone back up to a 10. The extended version of the film not only rectifies the gaps but also silences critics.Many claimed that the movie was too dark or that it just didn't make sense. To those people, I say: \"Pick up a comic book!\" Many of the critics of this particular film were part of the superhero bandwagon that formed when Marvel began its spree of Avengers-related films. In fact, its estimated that over 60% of people who go to see 'superhero' genre films have never picked up a comic book in their life. I would argue that similar numbers could figure to those which view the CW televised DC Universe shows. People complain that DC comics is just too dark but the fact is that these movies are based upon actual comics which are meant to be dark (ex: The Dark Knight Returns, Injustice, etc.). Its like complaining that Game of Thrones (the TV series) sucks because they kill off too many characters. Read the books! Its frustrating to see such a beautiful work of art like Batman V Superman criticized by those ignorant to its universe and its meaning. This movie is in fact a catalyst that opens numerous doorways and leaves true fans in awe of the possibilities for future movies. But regardless of whether or not people choose to educate themselves, this film's DVD/Blu-ray extended version puts the theater release to shame. All of the plot holes and gaps are filled in 30 minutes of extended footage scattered throughout the film. The movie ultimately becomes more complete and people will wish that the movie had shown the full 3 hours of footage in its theatrical debut. As a major DC comics fan, I will of course pick up on things that a comics fan would not, but someone who does not read comics would learn to appreciate this film in its entirety with the extended version. Get your hands on a copy today or find it on Netflix or the internet somewhere!"

"I ignored the bad reviews and watched anyways. This film had a lot to live up to after Civil War was released and I went into this film expecting the worst. It ended up to be the best Superhero film of 2016 to me. One complaint was that this film was more concerned about universe building than telling a great story than Civil War but for me it was the other way around; Civil War felt like a build up to something else and to be honest, I felt that way when I saw the other MCU films. Batman vs Superman however not only had a great story, but it also felt a lot more consistent than Civil War. This film was way more diverse with the cast than the MCU but unlike the MCU, I felt like this film doesn't go overboard with the SJW stuff like the MCU films or The Star Wars Sequel films do. The Visuals were AMAZING, The Score by Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL was AMAZING as well, The Tone is just right as I actually felt for the characters emotionally, The Cinematography kept my eyes glued to the screen, and the script felt really Intelligent and Complex and despite people calling the writing confusing, I was able to piece it together with no problem whatsoever. This film is similar to Empire Strikes back in terms of popularity so over time after the other movies are released, this movie would probably be more popular.This film was way better than I Expected and deserves another chance.

"Its shame to see what critics and marvel fans did to this movie and targeted Zack Snyder for it. I have seen this movie more than 25 times till date. And i enjoy this movie as much as i enjoyed the first time. The fans who have read DC comics, wouldn't be disappointed in this movie. Its dark movie, yes it is. Because the title shows the intense situation at hand. Two superheroes about to rip each other apart for whatever reasons that brought them to this stage. Yes it had to be dark and intense.Only marvel can be stupid enough to show an alien invasion where humans are loosing the battle and the super heroes are cracking jokes while battles as if they are playing ping pong. a person playing Call of Duty game is more serious while playing than the marvel heroes fighting aliens."

"Last week some news came out from somebody online who had claimed to have seen a finished version of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. If you were like me, you've been leery of checking it out because you weren't sure how much might actually be true. Now Zack Snyder has spoken out about the spoiler-filled post, although his response doesn't really clear anything up.In a word, to MTV, he called the post \"hilarious,which might imply that he's saying that it's mostly, if not entirely, untrue. That might be the case, but then again he could have just said it was untrue and he didn't say that. What he did say, however, is that he doesn't like spoilers. While this may seem odd for the director who's most recent trailer appeared to give away the entire movie, Snyder says that's not the case. Even if you've seen the trailer, you can rest easy, as there is much more we have not seen in then finished film. Says Snyder I have the benefit of seeing the movie. It's cool that think it's too much, and I appreciate people not wanting to know, but there's plenty that they don't know. There's a lot of movie that's not in the trailer. In the process of calling the Batman v Superman Reddit review hilarious, Snyder goes on to talk about how he hates it when spoilers come out. The director would much rather that fans see the movie mostly blind. While he understands that some fans may wish to find the answers before hand, he wants his movies to be mysteries going in. If you're, as an audience member, exploring these articles, looking for answers to questions that you have, maybe you're okay with knowing before you go. It's like an individual taste. But like I said, I want people to see the movie without knowing.Spoilers are a topic that mean different things to different people. While most try to avoid them to some degree, the need to solve the mystery is a nearly universal human experience. We have an inclination to want to know the truth, even while also wanting to be surprised. For most of us getting some information is good, but getting all the information is bad, of course, only getting the details that you want can be difficult."
"The theatrical is choppy, poorly edited, hard to follow, with some really good moments mixed in their. The extended is much more fluent and is much easier to follow, it does have a long runtime, which might make it seem a bit dragging on, but if you like long films done right, like Lord of the Rings, you will like this movie as long as you get into the characters and story. Speaking of which, the story starts out perfectly showing Bruce Wayne as a character, and it is very powerful. There are several moments in this movie that are powerful, emotional, and shocking. Characters. Batman is my favorite fictional character of all time, and believe me when I say, Ben Affleck as Batman was perfect, he had the charisma, the anger, and the look of being through some bad stuff Gal Gadot also does perfect as Wonder Woman, but if you want to really see how good she does, go watch the Wonder Woman movie. Henry Call as Superman. I really don't like it when people say Christopher Reeves is better. Don't get me wrong, Reeves does great, but can you imagine him as Superman in this movie? I wouldn't like it. It would be like Adam West playing Batman in The Dark Knight. Henry Cavill does great in this role, I can say everything about him as I said with Ben Affleck. Jesse Eisenberg as Luthor. I thought it was different in a good way. I've heard a criticism for him as being too much like Joker, but is that a bad thing? Joker is my favorite villain, so to see Superman have an enemy that crazy, but still hold the values Luthor needs to be Luthor, I think it is great. The thing I thought this movie was lacking in the first and second acts was humor, at least good humor. If there was more humor, I would've given this movie a ten because it would give a more relaxing feel to the parts that needed it. All in all though, this movie was awesome, it had powerful moments, it was badass, and just plain fun. It had a great story arc and does its job very well."

"*I will be talking about the Ultimate Edition of the film* This was one of the most anticipated CBM of all time. Ever since the arrival and subsequent success of Marvel's The Avengers people have wondered when will DC launch its own cinematic universe, one of the main reasons being the opportunity to finally see titans such as Batman and Superman share the screen together: the ultimate nerd dream. On 2016, the moment finally came for BvS to be released AND.. it performed poorly. Not only did critical reception left a lot to be desired, but fan reactions where surprisingly split after its cinematic debut. People either loved it and called Zack a genius, or hated it and called him a hack. Me, personally, I found myself with middle of the road feelings, for sure, but more leaning towards the negative side with subsequent viewings. The theatrical cut of the film showcased amazing performances, incredible visuals, and action set pieces that seemed like comic book panels come to life, in a good way. However, when it comes to its narrative structure and more technical aspects like editing, the film was seriously flawed. More plot holes than Age of Ultron, questionable character decisions, random editing that lacked cohesion and focus, and forced dramatic moments that lacked any impact because the attempts at character development ranged from limited to nonexistent, especially when it comes to Superman's character. I thought it was a 5/10 movie at best. As such, I was kind of skeptical about the idea of a 30 minute longer version. I say kind of because I know how Zack works. I remember Watchmen being vastly improved with its director's cut, so in a way I was expecting BvS to perform in a similar manner, but I also feared those 30 minutes wold be just there to amplify action and discredit storytelling issues. Oh boy, I'm so glad I was proved wrong. The ultimate cut of the film was infuriating, but not because it was awful, but because it questions the sanity of WB executives and editors and makes you wonder what were they thinking during the editing process. What I got out of the Ultimate Edition was a thought-provoking deconstruction of two very iconic superheroes that gave spotlight to the struggles both of them face when they aren't fighting crime. What I got was an extremely well produced character study on both Batman and Superman in a cynical world, a world dangerously close to our own. We meet Batman as a ruthless, worn out hero that has seen the failure behind his ideals and witnessed some truly horrifying things in his life. Superman, on the other hand, is portrayed as a godlike figure that seeks to do good in the world, but finds himself emotionally conflicted once he realized that every good deed he does leaves behind a trail of destruction (most of it due to Luthor's antics). In my opinion, this is a hugely original approach, one that distances itself from the rest of the competition and delivers a dark, somber, yet relevant superhero movie that understands both characters and gives them real human struggles to deal with. I felt invested in both of them, and hoped that by the end of the film both could find a way to redeem themselves. Their character arcs were very well established during the first two acts of the movie, and by the time we get to the titular climactic battle the emotion behind the jaw-dropping action is intensified. Lex Luthor as a villain was also given more time to develop with this new edition. One of the main criticisms with the original version was the fact that his plan relied too much on conveniences, and the character's mannerisms and mad-scientist attitude was annoying, and that goes without saying his motivations were unclear. Not only do we spend more time understanding his hate for any godlike figure and thus his hatred for Superman, but the added scenes allowed us to witness his entire plan come to fruition. It sells the cold, manipulative, calculating attributes of his comic counterpart. The acting is spot on. Every actor owns his/her role, from Cavill's Superman, to Ben Affleck as Batman, Eisenberg as Luthor, and Gadot as Wonder Woman, whose scenes are brief, but are more than enough to sell the strong and ferocious warrior that she is. Cinematography is stunning, and miles above that of Man of Steel's. And the soundtrack by Zimmer and Junkie XL? Perfect, just perfect. When it comes to flaws, the film still has some of those. The Martha moment, while serving as a pivotal character moment for Batman, felt off in execution, and its understandable that many people got mad at it. If your main complaint about BvS the first time around was its bleak tone and subject matter, this film is still not for you. I understand most were expecting to see the heroes being the most iconic versions of themselves, clashing in an elongated battle and evoking the same feelings The Avengers gave audiences back in 2012. In that sense, the film will remain divisive, but at least I have the comfort of saying that, at the very least, the film is competently made."

"This film was amazing. Ben Affleck was easily the best part of this movie, he brought his a-game as Batman. The chemistry between Affleck & Irons was outstanding. Gal Gadot did a great job as Wonder Woman. The fight between Batman & Superman was awesome. The final fight with Doomsday was outstanding in every way possible. However, there is only one problem with this film and that's Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor. He was sadly missed cast in this role, but then again it's really the fault of Warner Bros. Studios. Overall, this film deliver on almost every level. I highly recommend that you watch the extended version of this film."

"I know I know. I saw it in theaters too, and felt like it could've been so much better. While the Batman element was good, the narrative felt fractured, and the third act was just one long stunt scene. Superman was relegated to a supporting character, and other characters didn't get a chance to shine. And then I chanced on the ultimate cut. Calling it 30 mins of \"extra\" footage is unfair to Zack Snyder because it's exactly these 30 mins that makes the movie a worthy one. What I can say about the theatrical cut is this - It had the blockbuster elements - music, visuals, stunts, CGI. But, it lacked the human elements. The first 20 mins of the movie had it, but not after that. The extended cut in comparison has a flow to the narrative. There are no disjointed scenes, everything flows smoothly, and there's connective tissue. Superman gets to spend some time with his father, and mother. Clark Kent does some investigative journalism. Superman helps the people after the blast. Lois Lane doesn't jump to conclusions, she gets to the bottom of the crime. Lex Luthor apparently had a coherent plan - everything is explained pretty well. Wonder Woman was already good, so there's no change there :) Also, the \"Martha\" scene seems better executed, because it is a few seconds longer, and there's time to breathe it in. So, here's my take on this movie - The theatrical cut was junk. Get the Bluray for ultimate edition, and you shall not be disappointed. I've seen it so many more times now, and it's the definitive cut. It is the movie we deserve. It's a unique take on Batman, and Superman. It's a gritty take on the superhero movie genre, and definitely the best DCEU movie, and the best DC movie since The Dark Knight.P.S. Yes it's dark. We're adults, and we should appreciate mature film making without intentionally silly moments. It attempts to be philosophical, and something deep instead of just trying to make you chuckle."

"This is one of the best superhero movies ever made. Zack Snyder is a magician behind the camera.The reason behind so many complaints is the fact that Warner Bros. marketed this movie as a fight between Batman and Superman. That's not what it is. It's a movie about the origins of the Justice League.The cinematography, the acting and the score are all second to none. This film is phenomenal.P.S: watch the 3 hour extended cut that Snyder intended you to see, not the 2 and a half hour movie that Warner Bros. decided would be better for theaters."

"I don't care what the critics say, this is a very well-done movie. I'll start my review by listing what I like about the movie.1.) Ben Affleck is the best batman to me and it is not close. He pulls off the role of an aging batman extremely well. Also, Zack Snyder's vision of batman is legit. I have always hated batman up until this adaptation of him. Instead of being a conflicted and idealistic batman, this batman is dark, gritty, and 100% a badass. His equipment is decked out with machine guns and he has no aversion to killing people. In fact, he probably kills about 50 criminal by the time this movie is over. The warehouse scene is the coolest batman scene in any movie.2.) The development of a grudge between batman and superman is pulled off flawlessly. It actually makes sense why batman dislikes superman. Then, when they do fight it is about the coolest thing you can expect to see from a superhero film. 3.) I disagree with a lot of people about Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor. In my opinion, he played his role to perfection. 4.) B v S sets up Wonder Woman and Justice League with Gal Gadot's cameo as Wonder Woman and short clips of Aquaman, the Flash, and Cyborg. B v S is one of my favorite superhero films and rewatching it never gets old."

"The theatrical cut of this film is garbage which is why I rated it eight stars instead of nine. The first time I watched this film I didn't like it (not straight out hate but didn't like). Character motivations didn't make any sense, Lex was annoying as s***, editing was sloppy, and it was overly dark and broody for an action superhero movie. A year + a half, five Marvel films, a ton of bad reviews and a Justice League later a thought popped into my head: \"what if I watched BVS again\". This time I didn't have trailers ruining the best moments, I only vaguely remembered the film, and I was conditioned to look at it negatively but something unexpected happened: I actually loved it. Superman was just a normal person that tried to make a difference cause he could that others imposed their own beliefs on. Lex Luthor was a genius that couldn't stand his powerlessness compared to Superman or more accurately a super being. As Alfred said \"The fever, the rage, the feeling of powerlessness that turns good men... cruel\" and you see the same thought process in Batman. Batman, just like Lex Luthor feels powerless in the midst of a god-being and just like Lex he attempts to destroy him so he can get his sense of power back but unlike Lex, Batman learns something. I what is one of the corniest lines of the movie Superman says, \"Martha\" when he knows he can't win against Batman in a late desperate attempt to save his mother. Not only does this name connect with Bruce Wayne but it also shows what really matters to a man of steel: it isn't power, it isn't fame or anything else, it is his Mother and on a broader scale it is people. Lex (who doesn't care about people at all) knows he doesn't have the power so he creates something from his blood and the remains of Zod: A Doomsday for Superman. Not only does this film have depth but it also doesn't always explain it to you which is rare in a blockbuster action superhero flick normally cater to semi-comic book fans and people that want to shove popcorn in their mouths. This film rewards you for really noticing the details while still having massive explosions. One of my favorites is how Lex has all of Batman's branded killed which is why he isn't afraid of the branding at the end or Grandma's Peach Tea as a way of scaring the s*** out of someone. Of course, this film isn't perfect and I do have personal dislikes. The Batman V Superman fight was slow and pretty boring especially after watching such an amazing fight in Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 2 (If you haven't watched the animated Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 1 and 2 you are sorely missing out on something fantastic). Also, the addition of Wonder Woman who pretty much steals a hacker thing, gives it back and then suits up and fights against a giant monster thing. Not to say I don't like Wonder Woman (She is one of my favorite Superheroes of all time who showed not only can woman kick a** but they also don't need to be ashamed of their sexuality or gender) but she wasn't really that helpful to the plot and just brought in to expand the universe which was well done through Lex's superhuman hunting files. Also, the post-apocalyptic scene that was just a dream could have been cut but nothing is perfect except movies like Citizen Kane which isn't a lot of fun to watch cause it is too perfect. So to summarize, the theatrical cut is bad, the ultimate cut is Amazing and the other cut is meh. Please give it a second chance because it deserves it and save a good director from losing grace because of something he didn't do."
"I really liked it, don't know what all the hate is about. I'm actually a Marvel fan from when I was 7 or so, but Superman and Batman together in 1 movie? Just great. And personally I like Ben Affleck even better than Christian Bale as Batman. So just watch and enjoy, I know I did!"

"That's right. We have been waiting for these two heroes to finally meet and fight against each other. This movie is so good in both plot and special effects.Henry Cavill and Ben Affleck have performed well in their acting stages. They are the best superhero actors and they have filmed their fighting scenes very well. The movie starts to show the conflict between the lives of the heroes and now they have blamed each other for it. This movie is amazing and sets up a good plot for Dawn Justice."

"Actually...I didn't know what to expect. When you see Wonder Woman, you know it will be off of Wonder Woman and off of a Wonder Woman story, but with Batman V Superman, I was like, \"hmmmm, so who is this about?\" It was pretty obvious that it would feature many characters, but I thought the introduction to Batman was amazing. Ben Affleck nailed the part, not only as Batman but also as Bruce Wayne. He is my Batman. Henry Cavill continued to be super as the Man of Steel. And he is my Super - Man. A dark story? Yes, without a doubt. Could it have had a few more jokes? Sure. But not all movies or stories need to have jokes when certain events are serious. I really hope people can see this review and take another look at the movie, because, I loved it. I really hope the ratings can go up, eventually. And P.S, this movie is the perfect set up to Justice League."

"This film is crucial to the extended universe that DC is trying to build, but it feels highly derivative of better stories and continues to demonstrate the misuse of the iconic characters mentioned in the title. Plus Jesse Eisenberg feels wildly mis-casted."

"I'll start by making it clear I have only ever seen the Ultimate Edition. I'm aware of what was cut out for the theatrical release, so I will concede up front that most of the criticisms about pacing, editing, and missing bits of plot at release were merited.With that caveat out of the way, I must reiterate that this was bar-none the boldest superhero movie I have ever seen. To me, it was arguably the best as well, though \"best\" shouldn't be taken to mean \"most enjoyable.\" That honor easily goes to \"Thor: Ragnarok.\" What makes BvS stand out among other films in the genre is that it takes two characters who have been done to death since the 1970s and brings them up to date. I recently tried to watch \"Superman: The Movie\" for the first time in a number of years, and while it was still good and Reeves will always be iconic, I just couldn't take it seriously. I'll put it this way: If the story in BvS was \"stupid\" in your view but Superman turning back time by spinning the earth backward on its axis didn't seem like one of the dumbest things you have ever seen -in any movie from any genre- to the extent that it outright ruins the movie for you, then your opinion about BvS isn't worth much. Nostalgic bias was always going to be a problem for this movie, and the way people reacted to and reviewed \"Man of Steel\" was telling in this regard.That brings me to Zack Snyder's take on Superman. You know, that guy whose status as the first extraterrestrial ever encountered by humanity was a total non-issue in the old movies. Apparently, Snyder has a similar view to my own in that his take on the Man of Steel makes his being an alien a core piece of his identity. He may look like any other (absurdly attractive) person, but he knows what he is, and that makes him perpetually uncertain of where he fits in this world. He is essentially good and really does care about people, but he struggles to truly empathize with the likes of us. To be human is to be frail, and that is not something he can easily relate to. This is the root of his conflict with Batman.Just as Clark struggles to genuinely relate to most people, Snyder's Batman either refuses to or otherwise just can't relate to Superman. He doesn't see him as anything but a threat regardless of Superman's clear good intentions. Remember, a small group of Kryptonians were able to bring humanity to the brink of extinction in less than a day, and Bruce Wayne is nothing if not a realist. He didn't know the guy from Kansas. He only knew the god from another world.While Batman's anger toward and fear of Superman are readily apparent from the start, Superman's inability to imagine things from Bruce Wayne's perspective only becomes truly apparent during their first real interaction. This reminded me of the animated version of the \"world's finest\" storyline, where Superman judges Batman harshly for using fear tactics and threats of violence (also, actual violence) to get the job done. Superman wasn't willing to consider what it would take for a human man to fight criminals and save innocents, or what that life would do to him over time. Just as Batman didn't see the guy from Kansas, Superman didn't see the man who lives his life trapped in one brutal, unthinkably traumatic moment (this was beautifully conveyed during the film's opening moments), and had spent his whole adult life bearing witness to humanity at its absolute worst.The conflict between these two characters is as old as human history. They want the same things, but they can't understand one another. So they fight. And what a fight it was.Watching a fight between, say, Captain America and Iron Man was, to me, more frustrating than anything because each understood the other's perspective perfectly. The fight between Batman and Superman in BvS was genuinely gut-wrenching, as intended, because they would have understood one another if either had tried. The whole sequence hilighted Batman's tactical prowess and ability to control a situation. Maybe the most badass thing about the fight was that it ended exactly where Batman planned. That brings me to the big elephant in the room named \"Martha.\"I can't recall exactly which YouTuber put it this way, but if you thought the \"save Martha\" exchange was about their mothers having the same name, you had your brain turned off. The brain-on people have explained this to death, but it bears repeating. This was the moment when Superman became humanized to Batman. He was about to die, and his only concern was for his adoptive human mother. He still believed that the man about to take his life would do the right thing. Even with the cowl on, there was no mistaking the look on Batman's face. It was the look of shame, guilt, and sudden uncertainty that says \"What am I doing?\" Turns out even the most brutal, angry version of Bruce Wayne is better than Tony Stark at knowing right from wrong. At knowing that he had gone too far.From there, the third act was a series of truly impressive (albeit mostly CGI) fight sequences, beginning with what I regard as the undisputed champion of Batman fights. Nothing in the Nolan movies (and especially nothing in the Burton movies) even came close. Go ahead, try to convince yourself that Batman and Bane taking turns punching one another in the face until Bane's mask broke was a good fight sequence. No, this was a fight straight out of \"Arkham Knight,\" and it was glorious. The battle against Doomsday really was one for the books. From the moment Wonder Woman arrived accompanied by the intense sounds of Tina Guo's electric cello to Superman's tragic, heroic death at the hands of Doomsday, I was glued to the screen. Sure, the mere presence of Doomsday spoiled the end to a degree, but watching the Man of Steel laboring to carry that kryptonite spear towards certain death was no less impactful. A brief word on Jesse Eisenberg's take on Lex Luthor. At least one other reviewer on this site already said it best when they pointed out that this was his origin story. If you consider his scheme objectively, he is actually one of the more formidable incarnations of the character. If we're lucky, we'll eventually get to see a Snyder Cut of \"Justice League\" and find out where this story was actually meant to go. For the record, Joss Whedon and Danny Elfman both should have said \"no\" to taking a dump on someone else's art."
"BATMAN V SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE brings a fantastic surprise to a smash-hit team-up with one of the worlds most beloved DC Comics' icons of all time. The movie delivers spectacular casting, and fantastic acting with different characters having their shine in each scenes.The story follows Clark Kent/Superman who becomes a threat, after the destruction in Metropolis in Man Of Steel.(2013). Batman/Bruce Wayne sees him as a threat and begins his war on Superman.The movie brings spectacular storytelling, it tells the complications of human against alien who are on the same side, and the first meeting of Batman and Superman. The story of Bruce Wayne, with his many years of The Caped Crusader, sends him on a spiral of \"out of control\", sheer anger, and builds tension to wanting to defeat the Man of Steel. Snyder has fantastically gave this storytelling an exciting nod to the comics.Lex Luthor, played by Jesse Einsberg, delivers a very interesting performance, but very differently by him showing is his \"origin\" before he becomes a bald foe to the Man of Steel. He shows that his love of \"god vs man\" terrorises mankind when he ultimately creates Doomsday, and Batman realises Superman's inner heroism.It packs so many great \"out of nowhere\" excitement, including a first-look of the fearful Wonder Woman a.k.a. Diana Prince, played by Gal Gadot, and a fresh-new glimpse of the superhero DC canon: The Justice League.WATCH THIS MOVIE! The critics are out of their mind. It's a fun-packed action adventure which still keeps the movie enjoyable until it's final minutes of the movie. It's a FANTASTIC MOVIE! BEN AFFLECK AS BATMAN... is Incredible!A 10/10 overall!"
"I want to go on record as saying that this is a truly thrilling cinematic experience in so many ways. If pressed, I guess I could acknowledge that there were a couple ... let's say \"clumsy\" moments. And in a film that runs to three hours, that hardly seems like a significant issue, certainly not enough to rate it with fewer than 9 stars.This film has everything. There is dramatic tension right from the start. There is a magnificent story arc that picks up quite seamlessly from 'Man of Steel' and propels the viewer not only into the life of Clark Kent/Superman but also of Bruce Wayne/Batman.The villain is no mere cartoon of a villain; he is truly thoroughly (and apparently irrevocably) diabolical. He is a psychopath, and you wish for his death over and over and over. You want Superman to reduce him to ash with the power of his eyes.I have read a number of viewers' reviews, and it seems that the people who disliked the film / gave it a low rating had rather unfair and unrealistic expectations of it. That is, their own prejudices about how the plot could/should unfold or what the character development could/should be, etc. ruined the film for them. And that is a shame.My thought is: I settle into my seat, wait for the lights to dim, and then I wait to be transported by the film. I accept it, lock, stock, and barrel.As another reviewer remarked, I love how the film begins from the point of view of Bruce Wayne as he is among people on the ground who have fallen victim to the attack of Zod and the other Kryptonians.Why would Bruce Wayne not like Superman? Why would the good people of Earth hurl insults at Superman and burn him in effigy (on the news)? Because the good people of Earth just got catapulted into a new reality in which there are not only extraterrestrial beings (surprise!) but they are also superman! And a group of them are hell-bent on destroying humankind and taking the planet for themselves.It is difficult to see Superman as separate from the whole Kryptonian Krew.It seems that many moviegoers forgot that Bruce Wayne is also human. Sure, he's a hero, but he is flawed.. Just like the rest of us. He is a vigilante, after all.He has let his vigilantism get the better of him. HE is actually the one working outside the boundaries of the law, not Superman. It is the clear head of Alfred that shows us that he has gone into a rather dark place, that he has not seen what is really going on (in Luthor's scheme), and so he chooses to embark on his own scheme scheme to take out the alien invader. He is (allegedly) thinking of the future: if he wipes out the all-powerful alien, then it can't turn on humankind in the future. At least, he convinces himself of that.A philosophical question is raised in the film: should Clark Kent have remained a simple man from Kansas and never have become the Superman? Should he just let people die and let calamities happen? The question is answered for us in the character of Diana Prince/Wonder Woman. She withdrew from mankind (her exact words) and just sat around watching. Watching while people died horrible deaths all around her. So, should Superman have done the same? Do these special beings, these 'metahumans', have some kind of moral imperative to intervene, or should they be allowed to be regular people, too? It seems that humans want it both ways.It seems that humans are saying: \"Don't be a superalien ... except when I and my friends and family are in trouble. Then come save us.\""

"Batman v Superman: Ultimate Edition: If your looking for a quick, cheap thrill then you might not enjoy this film at the time. This movies theatrical version was butchered by WB and in doing so reshaped the story leaving numerous plot holes. So the Ultimate Edition is the full story and the one worth seeing. Watch 'Man of Steel' before seeing this movie. There is much to claw through here, so much so that the audience might easily find themselves exhausted from the overall aggression of the film. However, a lot of the story does work. The action is good, and the emotion feels real most of the time.This film is about Superman trying to become Superman. Trying to help the world, save people, find a place in this world not as an outcast, and yet is looked at has a threat by many. Superman is not from this world, yet He is trying to be human, find a place in this world, be excepted by earths people, and come into his destiny.This film is also about Batman being Batman for 20 years and losing faith in humanity, and fearing Superman, what Superman can do with his powers. Great film, great plot, great visuals. ---Yidioo"
"I didn't see the film in the theaters and just bought the \"Extended Edition \" on Amazon. I never properly saw Man of Steel- i think I rented it and watched it when already exhausted and fell asleep. I saw the mediocre user reviews and horrible reviews from critics of this film.They really have it wrong. This is the very best either Batman or Superman. It has a different take, on things. Much darker then earlier films even darker then the Christopher Nolan Batman films.First of all Christopher Nolan is an Executive Producer. So how bad could it be? I loved Sucker Punch and Zack Snyder was involved with that. So how bad could this be? Hans Zimmer did the music, so how bad could it be?I remember watching the old Superman TV shows and reading the Superman and Batman comics as a little kid and loved them, but i wouldn't call myself a \"fan boy\" of comic universes, like so many younger people today. As an older adult I will admit my favorite TV show of all time was Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but watched it on DVD only after it had finished. I saw the second of the Dark Knight series in the theater, but the other two, I watched on DVD. They were great, but not my favorite films like so many people. i also loved the first couple Superman and Batman films in the older series. Regardless, i was not waiting with baited breath to see Man of Steel or this one.I'm more of a serious film fan, who can watch Stanley Kubrick films over and over and my favorite films in the last twenty years, are Eyes Wide Shut and Intersteller, both of which i've watched multiple times.So, with that said, take it from me, the critics have this film very wrong, just as critics hated 2001: A Space Odyssey when it first came out. This film will have lasting appreciation.Surprised how much I liked Ben Afleck's Batman. it was hard to get into Henry Cavil's scrawnier looking Superman, but it grew on me. Amy Adams was great as Lois Lane, The Gal Gadol Wonder Women was amazing. Lex Luther was terrific, like Nolan's Joker. Jeremy Irons was the best Alfred ever. Holly Hunter and Diane Lane was good too. The movie had bad reviews but made a billion dollars. Hopefully everyone buys the Ultimate Edition and it breaks sales records and the film is re-appreciated. I have no idea what scenes this Ultimate Edition added, but it is pretty perfect. Now I can't wait for Wonder Woman and the Justice League and as soon as I finish writing this am going to watch Man of Steal. I'm into it now!I can only surmise that the bad reviews stem from too much expectations of the rigid fan boy types and the radical changes in tone, we see in this film.Total masterpiece of cinema, but I have a few criticisms. There are a few hollow scenes of typical Idiot cops and authorities getting everything wrong in a cliché type way and it has a few filler scenes of that type and a few moments here and there that felt rushed and cheesy. Maybe not everything restored into the Ultimate Edition should have been. I wish there had been more Kevin Costner scenes."

"The whole entire Batman V Superman movie was great and yes even though it felt slow to the majority of the people who watched it but to me I enjoyed every part and every scene of Batman V Superman and when it got to the fight scenes both batman VS Superman and the Doomsday fight it brought so much drama, intensity, and epic performances. So with that being said I give this movie a good 10/10 because it really did go to my expectations and it brought a powerful performance and a powerful yet epic introduction to the upcoming Justice League."

"When I first wrote a review for this movie a year ago exclaiming my excitement for the film, I had been high off a fresh dose of live-action DC superheroes playing out the beloved comic book stories that I had grown up on. It was all playing out before my eyes and coming to life. After a few months had passed, I began to notice things about the movie that I disliked: little gaps in the story, things that didn't add up, etc. My original rating of a 10 / 10 dropped to an 8 /10. But today it has gone back up to a 10. The extended version of the film not only rectifies the gaps but also silences critics.Many claimed that the movie was too dark or that it just didn't make sense. To those people, I say: \"Pick up a comic book!\" Many of the critics of this particular film were part of the superhero bandwagon that formed when Marvel began its spree of Avengers-related films. In fact, its estimated that over 60% of people who go to see 'superhero' genre films have never picked up a comic book in their life. I would argue that similar numbers could figure to those which view the CW televised DC Universe shows. People complain that DC comics is just too dark but the fact is that these movies are based upon actual comics which are meant to be dark (ex: The Dark Knight Returns, Injustice, etc.). Its like complaining that Game of Thrones (the TV series) sucks because they kill off too many characters. Read the books! Its frustrating to see such a beautiful work of art like Batman V Superman criticized by those ignorant to its universe and its meaning. This movie is in fact a catalyst that opens numerous doorways and leaves true fans in awe of the possibilities for future movies. But regardless of whether or not people choose to educate themselves, this film's DVD/Blu-ray extended version puts the theater release to shame. All of the plot holes and gaps are filled in 30 minutes of extended footage scattered throughout the film. The movie ultimately becomes more complete and people will wish that the movie had shown the full 3 hours of footage in its theatrical debut. As a major DC comics fan, I will of course pick up on things that a comics fan would not, but someone who does not read comics would learn to appreciate this film in its entirety with the extended version. Get your hands on a copy today or find it on Netflix or the internet somewhere!"

"I ignored the bad reviews and watched anyways. This film had a lot to live up to after Civil War was released and I went into this film expecting the worst. It ended up to be the best Superhero film of 2016 to me. One complaint was that this film was more concerned about universe building than telling a great story than Civil War but for me it was the other way around; Civil War felt like a build up to something else and to be honest, I felt that way when I saw the other MCU films. Batman vs Superman however not only had a great story, but it also felt a lot more consistent than Civil War. This film was way more diverse with the cast than the MCU but unlike the MCU, I felt like this film doesn't go overboard with the SJW stuff like the MCU films or The Star Wars Sequel films do. The Visuals were AMAZING, The Score by Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL was AMAZING as well, The Tone is just right as I actually felt for the characters emotionally, The Cinematography kept my eyes glued to the screen, and the script felt really Intelligent and Complex and despite people calling the writing confusing, I was able to piece it together with no problem whatsoever. This film is similar to Empire Strikes back in terms of popularity so over time after the other movies are released, this movie would probably be more popular.This film was way better than I Expected and deserves another chance.

"Its shame to see what critics and marvel fans did to this movie and targeted Zack Snyder for it. I have seen this movie more than 25 times till date. And i enjoy this movie as much as i enjoyed the first time. The fans who have read DC comics, wouldn't be disappointed in this movie. Its dark movie, yes it is. Because the title shows the intense situation at hand. Two superheroes about to rip each other apart for whatever reasons that brought them to this stage. Yes it had to be dark and intense.Only marvel can be stupid enough to show an alien invasion where humans are loosing the battle and the super heroes are cracking jokes while battles as if they are playing ping pong. a person playing Call of Duty game is more serious while playing than the marvel heroes fighting aliens."

"Last week some news came out from somebody online who had claimed to have seen a finished version of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. If you were like me, you've been leery of checking it out because you weren't sure how much might actually be true. Now Zack Snyder has spoken out about the spoiler-filled post, although his response doesn't really clear anything up.In a word, to MTV, he called the post \"hilarious,which might imply that he's saying that it's mostly, if not entirely, untrue. That might be the case, but then again he could have just said it was untrue and he didn't say that. What he did say, however, is that he doesn't like spoilers. While this may seem odd for the director who's most recent trailer appeared to give away the entire movie, Snyder says that's not the case. Even if you've seen the trailer, you can rest easy, as there is much more we have not seen in then finished film. Says Snyder I have the benefit of seeing the movie. It's cool that think it's too much, and I appreciate people not wanting to know, but there's plenty that they don't know. There's a lot of movie that's not in the trailer. In the process of calling the Batman v Superman Reddit review hilarious, Snyder goes on to talk about how he hates it when spoilers come out. The director would much rather that fans see the movie mostly blind. While he understands that some fans may wish to find the answers before hand, he wants his movies to be mysteries going in. If you're, as an audience member, exploring these articles, looking for answers to questions that you have, maybe you're okay with knowing before you go. It's like an individual taste. But like I said, I want people to see the movie without knowing.Spoilers are a topic that mean different things to different people. While most try to avoid them to some degree, the need to solve the mystery is a nearly universal human experience. We have an inclination to want to know the truth, even while also wanting to be surprised. For most of us getting some information is good, but getting all the information is bad, of course, only getting the details that you want can be difficult."
"The theatrical is choppy, poorly edited, hard to follow, with some really good moments mixed in their. The extended is much more fluent and is much easier to follow, it does have a long runtime, which might make it seem a bit dragging on, but if you like long films done right, like Lord of the Rings, you will like this movie as long as you get into the characters and story. Speaking of which, the story starts out perfectly showing Bruce Wayne as a character, and it is very powerful. There are several moments in this movie that are powerful, emotional, and shocking. Characters. Batman is my favorite fictional character of all time, and believe me when I say, Ben Affleck as Batman was perfect, he had the charisma, the anger, and the look of being through some bad stuff Gal Gadot also does perfect as Wonder Woman, but if you want to really see how good she does, go watch the Wonder Woman movie. Henry Call as Superman. I really don't like it when people say Christopher Reeves is better. Don't get me wrong, Reeves does great, but can you imagine him as Superman in this movie? I wouldn't like it. It would be like Adam West playing Batman in The Dark Knight. Henry Cavill does great in this role, I can say everything about him as I said with Ben Affleck. Jesse Eisenberg as Luthor. I thought it was different in a good way. I've heard a criticism for him as being too much like Joker, but is that a bad thing? Joker is my favorite villain, so to see Superman have an enemy that crazy, but still hold the values Luthor needs to be Luthor, I think it is great. The thing I thought this movie was lacking in the first and second acts was humor, at least good humor. If there was more humor, I would've given this movie a ten because it would give a more relaxing feel to the parts that needed it. All in all though, this movie was awesome, it had powerful moments, it was badass, and just plain fun. It had a great story arc and does its job very well."

"*I will be talking about the Ultimate Edition of the film* This was one of the most anticipated CBM of all time. Ever since the arrival and subsequent success of Marvel's The Avengers people have wondered when will DC launch its own cinematic universe, one of the main reasons being the opportunity to finally see titans such as Batman and Superman share the screen together: the ultimate nerd dream. On 2016, the moment finally came for BvS to be released AND.. it performed poorly. Not only did critical reception left a lot to be desired, but fan reactions where surprisingly split after its cinematic debut. People either loved it and called Zack a genius, or hated it and called him a hack. Me, personally, I found myself with middle of the road feelings, for sure, but more leaning towards the negative side with subsequent viewings. The theatrical cut of the film showcased amazing performances, incredible visuals, and action set pieces that seemed like comic book panels come to life, in a good way. However, when it comes to its narrative structure and more technical aspects like editing, the film was seriously flawed. More plot holes than Age of Ultron, questionable character decisions, random editing that lacked cohesion and focus, and forced dramatic moments that lacked any impact because the attempts at character development ranged from limited to nonexistent, especially when it comes to Superman's character. I thought it was a 5/10 movie at best. As such, I was kind of skeptical about the idea of a 30 minute longer version. I say kind of because I know how Zack works. I remember Watchmen being vastly improved with its director's cut, so in a way I was expecting BvS to perform in a similar manner, but I also feared those 30 minutes wold be just there to amplify action and discredit storytelling issues. Oh boy, I'm so glad I was proved wrong. The ultimate cut of the film was infuriating, but not because it was awful, but because it questions the sanity of WB executives and editors and makes you wonder what were they thinking during the editing process. What I got out of the Ultimate Edition was a thought-provoking deconstruction of two very iconic superheroes that gave spotlight to the struggles both of them face when they aren't fighting crime. What I got was an extremely well produced character study on both Batman and Superman in a cynical world, a world dangerously close to our own. We meet Batman as a ruthless, worn out hero that has seen the failure behind his ideals and witnessed some truly horrifying things in his life. Superman, on the other hand, is portrayed as a godlike figure that seeks to do good in the world, but finds himself emotionally conflicted once he realized that every good deed he does leaves behind a trail of destruction (most of it due to Luthor's antics). In my opinion, this is a hugely original approach, one that distances itself from the rest of the competition and delivers a dark, somber, yet relevant superhero movie that understands both characters and gives them real human struggles to deal with. I felt invested in both of them, and hoped that by the end of the film both could find a way to redeem themselves. Their character arcs were very well established during the first two acts of the movie, and by the time we get to the titular climactic battle the emotion behind the jaw-dropping action is intensified. Lex Luthor as a villain was also given more time to develop with this new edition. One of the main criticisms with the original version was the fact that his plan relied too much on conveniences, and the character's mannerisms and mad-scientist attitude was annoying, and that goes without saying his motivations were unclear. Not only do we spend more time understanding his hate for any godlike figure and thus his hatred for Superman, but the added scenes allowed us to witness his entire plan come to fruition. It sells the cold, manipulative, calculating attributes of his comic counterpart. The acting is spot on. Every actor owns his/her role, from Cavill's Superman, to Ben Affleck as Batman, Eisenberg as Luthor, and Gadot as Wonder Woman, whose scenes are brief, but are more than enough to sell the strong and ferocious warrior that she is. Cinematography is stunning, and miles above that of Man of Steel's. And the soundtrack by Zimmer and Junkie XL? Perfect, just perfect. When it comes to flaws, the film still has some of those. The Martha moment, while serving as a pivotal character moment for Batman, felt off in execution, and its understandable that many people got mad at it. If your main complaint about BvS the first time around was its bleak tone and subject matter, this film is still not for you. I understand most were expecting to see the heroes being the most iconic versions of themselves, clashing in an elongated battle and evoking the same feelings The Avengers gave audiences back in 2012. In that sense, the film will remain divisive, but at least I have the comfort of saying that, at the very least, the film is competently made."

"This film was amazing. Ben Affleck was easily the best part of this movie, he brought his a-game as Batman. The chemistry between Affleck & Irons was outstanding. Gal Gadot did a great job as Wonder Woman. The fight between Batman & Superman was awesome. The final fight with Doomsday was outstanding in every way possible. However, there is only one problem with this film and that's Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor. He was sadly missed cast in this role, but then again it's really the fault of Warner Bros. Studios. Overall, this film deliver on almost every level. I highly recommend that you watch the extended version of this film."

"I know I know. I saw it in theaters too, and felt like it could've been so much better. While the Batman element was good, the narrative felt fractured, and the third act was just one long stunt scene. Superman was relegated to a supporting character, and other characters didn't get a chance to shine. And then I chanced on the ultimate cut. Calling it 30 mins of \"extra\" footage is unfair to Zack Snyder because it's exactly these 30 mins that makes the movie a worthy one. What I can say about the theatrical cut is this - It had the blockbuster elements - music, visuals, stunts, CGI. But, it lacked the human elements. The first 20 mins of the movie had it, but not after that. The extended cut in comparison has a flow to the narrative. There are no disjointed scenes, everything flows smoothly, and there's connective tissue. Superman gets to spend some time with his father, and mother. Clark Kent does some investigative journalism. Superman helps the people after the blast. Lois Lane doesn't jump to conclusions, she gets to the bottom of the crime. Lex Luthor apparently had a coherent plan - everything is explained pretty well. Wonder Woman was already good, so there's no change there :) Also, the \"Martha\" scene seems better executed, because it is a few seconds longer, and there's time to breathe it in. So, here's my take on this movie - The theatrical cut was junk. Get the Bluray for ultimate edition, and you shall not be disappointed. I've seen it so many more times now, and it's the definitive cut. It is the movie we deserve. It's a unique take on Batman, and Superman. It's a gritty take on the superhero movie genre, and definitely the best DCEU movie, and the best DC movie since The Dark Knight.P.S. Yes it's dark. We're adults, and we should appreciate mature film making without intentionally silly moments. It attempts to be philosophical, and something deep instead of just trying to make you chuckle."

"This is one of the best superhero movies ever made. Zack Snyder is a magician behind the camera.The reason behind so many complaints is the fact that Warner Bros. marketed this movie as a fight between Batman and Superman. That's not what it is. It's a movie about the origins of the Justice League.The cinematography, the acting and the score are all second to none. This film is phenomenal.P.S: watch the 3 hour extended cut that Snyder intended you to see, not the 2 and a half hour movie that Warner Bros. decided would be better for theaters."

"I don't care what the critics say, this is a very well-done movie. I'll start my review by listing what I like about the movie.1.) Ben Affleck is the best batman to me and it is not close. He pulls off the role of an aging batman extremely well. Also, Zack Snyder's vision of batman is legit. I have always hated batman up until this adaptation of him. Instead of being a conflicted and idealistic batman, this batman is dark, gritty, and 100% a badass. His equipment is decked out with machine guns and he has no aversion to killing people. In fact, he probably kills about 50 criminal by the time this movie is over. The warehouse scene is the coolest batman scene in any movie.2.) The development of a grudge between batman and superman is pulled off flawlessly. It actually makes sense why batman dislikes superman. Then, when they do fight it is about the coolest thing you can expect to see from a superhero film. 3.) I disagree with a lot of people about Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor. In my opinion, he played his role to perfection. 4.) B v S sets up Wonder Woman and Justice League with Gal Gadot's cameo as Wonder Woman and short clips of Aquaman, the Flash, and Cyborg. B v S is one of my favorite superhero films and rewatching it never gets old."

"The theatrical cut of this film is garbage which is why I rated it eight stars instead of nine. The first time I watched this film I didn't like it (not straight out hate but didn't like). Character motivations didn't make any sense, Lex was annoying as s***, editing was sloppy, and it was overly dark and broody for an action superhero movie. A year + a half, five Marvel films, a ton of bad reviews and a Justice League later a thought popped into my head: \"what if I watched BVS again\". This time I didn't have trailers ruining the best moments, I only vaguely remembered the film, and I was conditioned to look at it negatively but something unexpected happened: I actually loved it. Superman was just a normal person that tried to make a difference cause he could that others imposed their own beliefs on. Lex Luthor was a genius that couldn't stand his powerlessness compared to Superman or more accurately a super being. As Alfred said \"The fever, the rage, the feeling of powerlessness that turns good men... cruel\" and you see the same thought process in Batman. Batman, just like Lex Luthor feels powerless in the midst of a god-being and just like Lex he attempts to destroy him so he can get his sense of power back but unlike Lex, Batman learns something. I what is one of the corniest lines of the movie Superman says, \"Martha\" when he knows he can't win against Batman in a late desperate attempt to save his mother. Not only does this name connect with Bruce Wayne but it also shows what really matters to a man of steel: it isn't power, it isn't fame or anything else, it is his Mother and on a broader scale it is people. Lex (who doesn't care about people at all) knows he doesn't have the power so he creates something from his blood and the remains of Zod: A Doomsday for Superman. Not only does this film have depth but it also doesn't always explain it to you which is rare in a blockbuster action superhero flick normally cater to semi-comic book fans and people that want to shove popcorn in their mouths. This film rewards you for really noticing the details while still having massive explosions. One of my favorites is how Lex has all of Batman's branded killed which is why he isn't afraid of the branding at the end or Grandma's Peach Tea as a way of scaring the s*** out of someone. Of course, this film isn't perfect and I do have personal dislikes. The Batman V Superman fight was slow and pretty boring especially after watching such an amazing fight in Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 2 (If you haven't watched the animated Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 1 and 2 you are sorely missing out on something fantastic). Also, the addition of Wonder Woman who pretty much steals a hacker thing, gives it back and then suits up and fights against a giant monster thing. Not to say I don't like Wonder Woman (She is one of my favorite Superheroes of all time who showed not only can woman kick a** but they also don't need to be ashamed of their sexuality or gender) but she wasn't really that helpful to the plot and just brought in to expand the universe which was well done through Lex's superhuman hunting files. Also, the post-apocalyptic scene that was just a dream could have been cut but nothing is perfect except movies like Citizen Kane which isn't a lot of fun to watch cause it is too perfect. So to summarize, the theatrical cut is bad, the ultimate cut is Amazing and the other cut is meh. Please give it a second chance because it deserves it and save a good director from losing grace because of something he didn't do."
"I really liked it, don't know what all the hate is about. I'm actually a Marvel fan from when I was 7 or so, but Superman and Batman together in 1 movie? Just great. And personally I like Ben Affleck even better than Christian Bale as Batman. So just watch and enjoy, I know I did!"

"That's right. We have been waiting for these two heroes to finally meet and fight against each other. This movie is so good in both plot and special effects.Henry Cavill and Ben Affleck have performed well in their acting stages. They are the best superhero actors and they have filmed their fighting scenes very well. The movie starts to show the conflict between the lives of the heroes and now they have blamed each other for it. This movie is amazing and sets up a good plot for Dawn Justice."

"Actually...I didn't know what to expect. When you see Wonder Woman, you know it will be off of Wonder Woman and off of a Wonder Woman story, but with Batman V Superman, I was like, \"hmmmm, so who is this about?\" It was pretty obvious that it would feature many characters, but I thought the introduction to Batman was amazing. Ben Affleck nailed the part, not only as Batman but also as Bruce Wayne. He is my Batman. Henry Cavill continued to be super as the Man of Steel. And he is my Super - Man. A dark story? Yes, without a doubt. Could it have had a few more jokes? Sure. But not all movies or stories need to have jokes when certain events are serious. I really hope people can see this review and take another look at the movie, because, I loved it. I really hope the ratings can go up, eventually. And P.S, this movie is the perfect set up to Justice League."

"I'll start by making it clear I have only ever seen the Ultimate Edition. I'm aware of what was cut out for the theatrical release, so I will concede up front that most of the criticisms about pacing, editing, and missing bits of plot at release were merited.With that caveat out of the way, I must reiterate that this was bar-none the boldest superhero movie I have ever seen. To me, it was arguably the best as well, though \"best\" shouldn't be taken to mean \"most enjoyable.\" That honor easily goes to \"Thor: Ragnarok.\" What makes BvS stand out among other films in the genre is that it takes two characters who have been done to death since the 1970s and brings them up to date. I recently tried to watch \"Superman: The Movie\" for the first time in a number of years, and while it was still good and Reeves will always be iconic, I just couldn't take it seriously. I'll put it this way: If the story in BvS was \"stupid\" in your view but Superman turning back time by spinning the earth backward on its axis didn't seem like one of the dumbest things you have ever seen -in any movie from any genre- to the extent that it outright ruins the movie for you, then your opinion about BvS isn't worth much. Nostalgic bias was always going to be a problem for this movie, and the way people reacted to and reviewed \"Man of Steel\" was telling in this regard.That brings me to Zack Snyder's take on Superman. You know, that guy whose status as the first extraterrestrial ever encountered by humanity was a total non-issue in the old movies. Apparently, Snyder has a similar view to my own in that his take on the Man of Steel makes his being an alien a core piece of his identity. He may look like any other (absurdly attractive) person, but he knows what he is, and that makes him perpetually uncertain of where he fits in this world. He is essentially good and really does care about people, but he struggles to truly empathize with the likes of us. To be human is to be frail, and that is not something he can easily relate to. This is the root of his conflict with Batman.Just as Clark struggles to genuinely relate to most people, Snyder's Batman either refuses to or otherwise just can't relate to Superman. He doesn't see him as anything but a threat regardless of Superman's clear good intentions. Remember, a small group of Kryptonians were able to bring humanity to the brink of extinction in less than a day, and Bruce Wayne is nothing if not a realist. He didn't know the guy from Kansas. He only knew the god from another world.While Batman's anger toward and fear of Superman are readily apparent from the start, Superman's inability to imagine things from Bruce Wayne's perspective only becomes truly apparent during their first real interaction. This reminded me of the animated version of the \"world's finest\" storyline, where Superman judges Batman harshly for using fear tactics and threats of violence (also, actual violence) to get the job done. Superman wasn't willing to consider what it would take for a human man to fight criminals and save innocents, or what that life would do to him over time. Just as Batman didn't see the guy from Kansas, Superman didn't see the man who lives his life trapped in one brutal, unthinkably traumatic moment (this was beautifully conveyed during the film's opening moments), and had spent his whole adult life bearing witness to humanity at its absolute worst.The conflict between these two characters is as old as human history. They want the same things, but they can't understand one another. So they fight. And what a fight it was.Watching a fight between, say, Captain America and Iron Man was, to me, more frustrating than anything because each understood the other's perspective perfectly. The fight between Batman and Superman in BvS was genuinely gut-wrenching, as intended, because they would have understood one another if either had tried. The whole sequence hilighted Batman's tactical prowess and ability to control a situation. Maybe the most badass thing about the fight was that it ended exactly where Batman planned. That brings me to the big elephant in the room named \"Martha.\"I can't recall exactly which YouTuber put it this way, but if you thought the \"save Martha\" exchange was about their mothers having the same name, you had your brain turned off. The brain-on people have explained this to death, but it bears repeating. This was the moment when Superman became humanized to Batman. He was about to die, and his only concern was for his adoptive human mother. He still believed that the man about to take his life would do the right thing. Even with the cowl on, there was no mistaking the look on Batman's face. It was the look of shame, guilt, and sudden uncertainty that says \"What am I doing?\" Turns out even the most brutal, angry version of Bruce Wayne is better than Tony Stark at knowing right from wrong. At knowing that he had gone too far.From there, the third act was a series of truly impressive (albeit mostly CGI) fight sequences, beginning with what I regard as the undisputed champion of Batman fights. Nothing in the Nolan movies (and especially nothing in the Burton movies) even came close. Go ahead, try to convince yourself that Batman and Bane taking turns punching one another in the face until Bane's mask broke was a good fight sequence. No, this was a fight straight out of \"Arkham Knight,\" and it was glorious. The battle against Doomsday really was one for the books. From the moment Wonder Woman arrived accompanied by the intense sounds of Tina Guo's electric cello to Superman's tragic, heroic death at the hands of Doomsday, I was glued to the screen. Sure, the mere presence of Doomsday spoiled the end to a degree, but watching the Man of Steel laboring to carry that kryptonite spear towards certain death was no less impactful. A brief word on Jesse Eisenberg's take on Lex Luthor. At least one other reviewer on this site already said it best when they pointed out that this was his origin story. If you consider his scheme objectively, he is actually one of the more formidable incarnations of the character. If we're lucky, we'll eventually get to see a Snyder Cut of \"Justice League\" and find out where this story was actually meant to go. For the record, Joss Whedon and Danny Elfman both should have said \"no\" to taking a dump on someone else's art."
"BATMAN V SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE brings a fantastic surprise to a smash-hit team-up with one of the worlds most beloved DC Comics' icons of all time. The movie delivers spectacular casting, and fantastic acting with different characters having their shine in each scenes.The story follows Clark Kent/Superman who becomes a threat, after the destruction in Metropolis in Man Of Steel.(2013). Batman/Bruce Wayne sees him as a threat and begins his war on Superman.The movie brings spectacular storytelling, it tells the complications of human against alien who are on the same side, and the first meeting of Batman and Superman. The story of Bruce Wayne, with his many years of The Caped Crusader, sends him on a spiral of \"out of control\", sheer anger, and builds tension to wanting to defeat the Man of Steel. Snyder has fantastically gave this storytelling an exciting nod to the comics.Lex Luthor, played by Jesse Einsberg, delivers a very interesting performance, but very differently by him showing is his \"origin\" before he becomes a bald foe to the Man of Steel. He shows that his love of \"god vs man\" terrorises mankind when he ultimately creates Doomsday, and Batman realises Superman's inner heroism.It packs so many great \"out of nowhere\" excitement, including a first-look of the fearful Wonder Woman a.k.a. Diana Prince, played by Gal Gadot, and a fresh-new glimpse of the superhero DC canon: The Justice League.WATCH THIS MOVIE! The critics are out of their mind. It's a fun-packed action adventure which still keeps the movie enjoyable until it's final minutes of the movie. It's a FANTASTIC MOVIE! BEN AFFLECK AS BATMAN... is Incredible!A 10/10 overall!"
"I want to go on record as saying that this is a truly thrilling cinematic experience in so many ways. If pressed, I guess I could acknowledge that there were a couple ... let's say \"clumsy\" moments. And in a film that runs to three hours, that hardly seems like a significant issue, certainly not enough to rate it with fewer than 9 stars.This film has everything. There is dramatic tension right from the start. There is a magnificent story arc that picks up quite seamlessly from 'Man of Steel' and propels the viewer not only into the life of Clark Kent/Superman but also of Bruce Wayne/Batman.The villain is no mere cartoon of a villain; he is truly thoroughly (and apparently irrevocably) diabolical. He is a psychopath, and you wish for his death over and over and over. You want Superman to reduce him to ash with the power of his eyes.I have read a number of viewers' reviews, and it seems that the people who disliked the film / gave it a low rating had rather unfair and unrealistic expectations of it. That is, their own prejudices about how the plot could/should unfold or what the character development could/should be, etc. ruined the film for them. And that is a shame.My thought is: I settle into my seat, wait for the lights to dim, and then I wait to be transported by the film. I accept it, lock, stock, and barrel.As another reviewer remarked, I love how the film begins from the point of view of Bruce Wayne as he is among people on the ground who have fallen victim to the attack of Zod and the other Kryptonians.Why would Bruce Wayne not like Superman? Why would the good people of Earth hurl insults at Superman and burn him in effigy (on the news)? Because the good people of Earth just got catapulted into a new reality in which there are not only extraterrestrial beings (surprise!) but they are also superman! And a group of them are hell-bent on destroying humankind and taking the planet for themselves.It is difficult to see Superman as separate from the whole Kryptonian Krew.It seems that many moviegoers forgot that Bruce Wayne is also human. Sure, he's a hero, but he is flawed.. Just like the rest of us. He is a vigilante, after all.He has let his vigilantism get the better of him. HE is actually the one working outside the boundaries of the law, not Superman. It is the clear head of Alfred that shows us that he has gone into a rather dark place, that he has not seen what is really going on (in Luthor's scheme), and so he chooses to embark on his own scheme scheme to take out the alien invader. He is (allegedly) thinking of the future: if he wipes out the all-powerful alien, then it can't turn on humankind in the future. At least, he convinces himself of that.A philosophical question is raised in the film: should Clark Kent have remained a simple man from Kansas and never have become the Superman? Should he just let people die and let calamities happen? The question is answered for us in the character of Diana Prince/Wonder Woman. She withdrew from mankind (her exact words) and just sat around watching. Watching while people died horrible deaths all around her. So, should Superman have done the same? Do these special beings, these 'metahumans', have some kind of moral imperative to intervene, or should they be allowed to be regular people, too? It seems that humans want it both ways.It seems that humans are saying: \"Don't be a superalien ... except when I and my friends and family are in trouble. Then come save us.\""

"Batman v Superman: Ultimate Edition: If your looking for a quick, cheap thrill then you might not enjoy this film at the time. This movies theatrical version was butchered by WB and in doing so reshaped the story leaving numerous plot holes. So the Ultimate Edition is the full story and the one worth seeing. Watch 'Man of Steel' before seeing this movie. There is much to claw through here, so much so that the audience might easily find themselves exhausted from the overall aggression of the film. However, a lot of the story does work. The action is good, and the emotion feels real most of the time.This film is about Superman trying to become Superman. Trying to help the world, save people, find a place in this world not as an outcast, and yet is looked at has a threat by many. Superman is not from this world, yet He is trying to be human, find a place in this world, be excepted by earths people, and come into his destiny.This film is also about Batman being Batman for 20 years and losing faith in humanity, and fearing Superman, what Superman can do with his powers. Great film, great plot, great visuals. ---Yidioo"
"I didn't see the film in the theaters and just bought the \"Extended Edition \" on Amazon. I never properly saw Man of Steel- i think I rented it and watched it when already exhausted and fell asleep. I saw the mediocre user reviews and horrible reviews from critics of this film.They really have it wrong. This is the very best either Batman or Superman. It has a different take, on things. Much darker then earlier films even darker then the Christopher Nolan Batman films.First of all Christopher Nolan is an Executive Producer. So how bad could it be? I loved Sucker Punch and Zack Snyder was involved with that. So how bad could this be? Hans Zimmer did the music, so how bad could it be?I remember watching the old Superman TV shows and reading the Superman and Batman comics as a little kid and loved them, but i wouldn't call myself a \"fan boy\" of comic universes, like so many younger people today. As an older adult I will admit my favorite TV show of all time was Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but watched it on DVD only after it had finished. I saw the second of the Dark Knight series in the theater, but the other two, I watched on DVD. They were great, but not my favorite films like so many people. i also loved the first couple Superman and Batman films in the older series. Regardless, i was not waiting with baited breath to see Man of Steel or this one.I'm more of a serious film fan, who can watch Stanley Kubrick films over and over and my favorite films in the last twenty years, are Eyes Wide Shut and Intersteller, both of which i've watched multiple times.So, with that said, take it from me, the critics have this film very wrong, just as critics hated 2001: A Space Odyssey when it first came out. This film will have lasting appreciation.Surprised how much I liked Ben Afleck's Batman. it was hard to get into Henry Cavil's scrawnier looking Superman, but it grew on me. Amy Adams was great as Lois Lane, The Gal Gadol Wonder Women was amazing. Lex Luther was terrific, like Nolan's Joker. Jeremy Irons was the best Alfred ever. Holly Hunter and Diane Lane was good too. The movie had bad reviews but made a billion dollars. Hopefully everyone buys the Ultimate Edition and it breaks sales records and the film is re-appreciated. I have no idea what scenes this Ultimate Edition added, but it is pretty perfect. Now I can't wait for Wonder Woman and the Justice League and as soon as I finish writing this am going to watch Man of Steal. I'm into it now!I can only surmise that the bad reviews stem from too much expectations of the rigid fan boy types and the radical changes in tone, we see in this film.Total masterpiece of cinema, but I have a few criticisms. There are a few hollow scenes of typical Idiot cops and authorities getting everything wrong in a cliché type way and it has a few filler scenes of that type and a few moments here and there that felt rushed and cheesy. Maybe not everything restored into the Ultimate Edition should have been. I wish there had been more Kevin Costner scenes."

"The whole entire Batman V Superman movie was great and yes even though it felt slow to the majority of the people who watched it but to me I enjoyed every part and every scene of Batman V Superman and when it got to the fight scenes both batman VS Superman and the Doomsday fight it brought so much drama, intensity, and epic performances. So with that being said I give this movie a good 10/10 because it really did go to my expectations and it brought a powerful performance and a powerful yet epic introduction to the upcoming Justice League."

"When I first wrote a review for this movie a year ago exclaiming my excitement for the film, I had been high off a fresh dose of live-action DC superheroes playing out the beloved comic book stories that I had grown up on. It was all playing out before my eyes and coming to life. After a few months had passed, I began to notice things about the movie that I disliked: little gaps in the story, things that didn't add up, etc. My original rating of a 10 / 10 dropped to an 8 /10. But today it has gone back up to a 10. The extended version of the film not only rectifies the gaps but also silences critics.Many claimed that the movie was too dark or that it just didn't make sense. To those people, I say: \"Pick up a comic book!\" Many of the critics of this particular film were part of the superhero bandwagon that formed when Marvel began its spree of Avengers-related films. In fact, its estimated that over 60% of people who go to see 'superhero' genre films have never picked up a comic book in their life. I would argue that similar numbers could figure to those which view the CW televised DC Universe shows. People complain that DC comics is just too dark but the fact is that these movies are based upon actual comics which are meant to be dark (ex: The Dark Knight Returns, Injustice, etc.). Its like complaining that Game of Thrones (the TV series) sucks because they kill off too many characters. Read the books! Its frustrating to see such a beautiful work of art like Batman V Superman criticized by those ignorant to its universe and its meaning. This movie is in fact a catalyst that opens numerous doorways and leaves true fans in awe of the possibilities for future movies. But regardless of whether or not people choose to educate themselves, this film's DVD/Blu-ray extended version puts the theater release to shame. All of the plot holes and gaps are filled in 30 minutes of extended footage scattered throughout the film. The movie ultimately becomes more complete and people will wish that the movie had shown the full 3 hours of footage in its theatrical debut. As a major DC comics fan, I will of course pick up on things that a comics fan would not, but someone who does not read comics would learn to appreciate this film in its entirety with the extended version. Get your hands on a copy today or find it on Netflix or the internet somewhere!"

"I ignored the bad reviews and watched anyways. This film had a lot to live up to after Civil War was released and I went into this film expecting the worst. It ended up to be the best Superhero film of 2016 to me. One complaint was that this film was more concerned about universe building than telling a great story than Civil War but for me it was the other way around; Civil War felt like a build up to something else and to be honest, I felt that way when I saw the other MCU films. Batman vs Superman however not only had a great story, but it also felt a lot more consistent than Civil War. This film was way more diverse with the cast than the MCU but unlike the MCU, I felt like this film doesn't go overboard with the SJW stuff like the MCU films or The Star Wars Sequel films do. The Visuals were AMAZING, The Score by Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL was AMAZING as well, The Tone is just right as I actually felt for the characters emotionally, The Cinematography kept my eyes glued to the screen, and the script felt really Intelligent and Complex and despite people calling the writing confusing, I was able to piece it together with no problem whatsoever. This film is similar to Empire Strikes back in terms of popularity so over time after the other movies are released, this movie would probably be more popular.This film was way better than I Expected and deserves another chance.

"Its shame to see what critics and marvel fans did to this movie and targeted Zack Snyder for it. I have seen this movie more than 25 times till date. And i enjoy this movie as much as i enjoyed the first time. The fans who have read DC comics, wouldn't be disappointed in this movie. Its dark movie, yes it is. Because the title shows the intense situation at hand. Two superheroes about to rip each other apart for whatever reasons that brought them to this stage. Yes it had to be dark and intense.Only marvel can be stupid enough to show an alien invasion where humans are loosing the battle and the super heroes are cracking jokes while battles as if they are playing ping pong. a person playing Call of Duty game is more serious while playing than the marvel heroes fighting aliens."

"Last week some news came out from somebody online who had claimed to have seen a finished version of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. If you were like me, you've been leery of checking it out because you weren't sure how much might actually be true. Now Zack Snyder has spoken out about the spoiler-filled post, although his response doesn't really clear anything up.In a word, to MTV, he called the post \"hilarious,which might imply that he's saying that it's mostly, if not entirely, untrue. That might be the case, but then again he could have just said it was untrue and he didn't say that. What he did say, however, is that he doesn't like spoilers. While this may seem odd for the director who's most recent trailer appeared to give away the entire movie, Snyder says that's not the case. Even if you've seen the trailer, you can rest easy, as there is much more we have not seen in then finished film. Says Snyder I have the benefit of seeing the movie. It's cool that think it's too much, and I appreciate people not wanting to know, but there's plenty that they don't know. There's a lot of movie that's not in the trailer. In the process of calling the Batman v Superman Reddit review hilarious, Snyder goes on to talk about how he hates it when spoilers come out. The director would much rather that fans see the movie mostly blind. While he understands that some fans may wish to find the answers before hand, he wants his movies to be mysteries going in. If you're, as an audience member, exploring these articles, looking for answers to questions that you have, maybe you're okay with knowing before you go. It's like an individual taste. But like I said, I want people to see the movie without knowing.Spoilers are a topic that mean different things to different people. While most try to avoid them to some degree, the need to solve the mystery is a nearly universal human experience. We have an inclination to want to know the truth, even while also wanting to be surprised. For most of us getting some information is good, but getting all the information is bad, of course, only getting the details that you want can be difficult."
"The theatrical is choppy, poorly edited, hard to follow, with some really good moments mixed in their. The extended is much more fluent and is much easier to follow, it does have a long runtime, which might make it seem a bit dragging on, but if you like long films done right, like Lord of the Rings, you will like this movie as long as you get into the characters and story. Speaking of which, the story starts out perfectly showing Bruce Wayne as a character, and it is very powerful. There are several moments in this movie that are powerful, emotional, and shocking. Characters. Batman is my favorite fictional character of all time, and believe me when I say, Ben Affleck as Batman was perfect, he had the charisma, the anger, and the look of being through some bad stuff Gal Gadot also does perfect as Wonder Woman, but if you want to really see how good she does, go watch the Wonder Woman movie. Henry Call as Superman. I really don't like it when people say Christopher Reeves is better. Don't get me wrong, Reeves does great, but can you imagine him as Superman in this movie? I wouldn't like it. It would be like Adam West playing Batman in The Dark Knight. Henry Cavill does great in this role, I can say everything about him as I said with Ben Affleck. Jesse Eisenberg as Luthor. I thought it was different in a good way. I've heard a criticism for him as being too much like Joker, but is that a bad thing? Joker is my favorite villain, so to see Superman have an enemy that crazy, but still hold the values Luthor needs to be Luthor, I think it is great. The thing I thought this movie was lacking in the first and second acts was humor, at least good humor. If there was more humor, I would've given this movie a ten because it would give a more relaxing feel to the parts that needed it. All in all though, this movie was awesome, it had powerful moments, it was badass, and just plain fun. It had a great story arc and does its job very well."

"*I will be talking about the Ultimate Edition of the film* This was one of the most anticipated CBM of all time. Ever since the arrival and subsequent success of Marvel's The Avengers people have wondered when will DC launch its own cinematic universe, one of the main reasons being the opportunity to finally see titans such as Batman and Superman share the screen together: the ultimate nerd dream. On 2016, the moment finally came for BvS to be released AND.. it performed poorly. Not only did critical reception left a lot to be desired, but fan reactions where surprisingly split after its cinematic debut. People either loved it and called Zack a genius, or hated it and called him a hack. Me, personally, I found myself with middle of the road feelings, for sure, but more leaning towards the negative side with subsequent viewings. The theatrical cut of the film showcased amazing performances, incredible visuals, and action set pieces that seemed like comic book panels come to life, in a good way. However, when it comes to its narrative structure and more technical aspects like editing, the film was seriously flawed. More plot holes than Age of Ultron, questionable character decisions, random editing that lacked cohesion and focus, and forced dramatic moments that lacked any impact because the attempts at character development ranged from limited to nonexistent, especially when it comes to Superman's character. I thought it was a 5/10 movie at best. As such, I was kind of skeptical about the idea of a 30 minute longer version. I say kind of because I know how Zack works. I remember Watchmen being vastly improved with its director's cut, so in a way I was expecting BvS to perform in a similar manner, but I also feared those 30 minutes wold be just there to amplify action and discredit storytelling issues. Oh boy, I'm so glad I was proved wrong. The ultimate cut of the film was infuriating, but not because it was awful, but because it questions the sanity of WB executives and editors and makes you wonder what were they thinking during the editing process. What I got out of the Ultimate Edition was a thought-provoking deconstruction of two very iconic superheroes that gave spotlight to the struggles both of them face when they aren't fighting crime. What I got was an extremely well produced character study on both Batman and Superman in a cynical world, a world dangerously close to our own. We meet Batman as a ruthless, worn out hero that has seen the failure behind his ideals and witnessed some truly horrifying things in his life. Superman, on the other hand, is portrayed as a godlike figure that seeks to do good in the world, but finds himself emotionally conflicted once he realized that every good deed he does leaves behind a trail of destruction (most of it due to Luthor's antics). In my opinion, this is a hugely original approach, one that distances itself from the rest of the competition and delivers a dark, somber, yet relevant superhero movie that understands both characters and gives them real human struggles to deal with. I felt invested in both of them, and hoped that by the end of the film both could find a way to redeem themselves. Their character arcs were very well established during the first two acts of the movie, and by the time we get to the titular climactic battle the emotion behind the jaw-dropping action is intensified. Lex Luthor as a villain was also given more time to develop with this new edition. One of the main criticisms with the original version was the fact that his plan relied too much on conveniences, and the character's mannerisms and mad-scientist attitude was annoying, and that goes without saying his motivations were unclear. Not only do we spend more time understanding his hate for any godlike figure and thus his hatred for Superman, but the added scenes allowed us to witness his entire plan come to fruition. It sells the cold, manipulative, calculating attributes of his comic counterpart. The acting is spot on. Every actor owns his/her role, from Cavill's Superman, to Ben Affleck as Batman, Eisenberg as Luthor, and Gadot as Wonder Woman, whose scenes are brief, but are more than enough to sell the strong and ferocious warrior that she is. Cinematography is stunning, and miles above that of Man of Steel's. And the soundtrack by Zimmer and Junkie XL? Perfect, just perfect. When it comes to flaws, the film still has some of those. The Martha moment, while serving as a pivotal character moment for Batman, felt off in execution, and its understandable that many people got mad at it. If your main complaint about BvS the first time around was its bleak tone and subject matter, this film is still not for you. I understand most were expecting to see the heroes being the most iconic versions of themselves, clashing in an elongated battle and evoking the same feelings The Avengers gave audiences back in 2012. In that sense, the film will remain divisive, but at least I have the comfort of saying that, at the very least, the film is competently made."

"This film was amazing. Ben Affleck was easily the best part of this movie, he brought his a-game as Batman. The chemistry between Affleck & Irons was outstanding. Gal Gadot did a great job as Wonder Woman. The fight between Batman & Superman was awesome. The final fight with Doomsday was outstanding in every way possible. However, there is only one problem with this film and that's Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor. He was sadly missed cast in this role, but then again it's really the fault of Warner Bros. Studios. Overall, this film deliver on almost every level. I highly recommend that you watch the extended version of this film."

"I know I know. I saw it in theaters too, and felt like it could've been so much better. While the Batman element was good, the narrative felt fractured, and the third act was just one long stunt scene. Superman was relegated to a supporting character, and other characters didn't get a chance to shine. And then I chanced on the ultimate cut. Calling it 30 mins of \"extra\" footage is unfair to Zack Snyder because it's exactly these 30 mins that makes the movie a worthy one. What I can say about the theatrical cut is this - It had the blockbuster elements - music, visuals, stunts, CGI. But, it lacked the human elements. The first 20 mins of the movie had it, but not after that. The extended cut in comparison has a flow to the narrative. There are no disjointed scenes, everything flows smoothly, and there's connective tissue. Superman gets to spend some time with his father, and mother. Clark Kent does some investigative journalism. Superman helps the people after the blast. Lois Lane doesn't jump to conclusions, she gets to the bottom of the crime. Lex Luthor apparently had a coherent plan - everything is explained pretty well. Wonder Woman was already good, so there's no change there :) Also, the \"Martha\" scene seems better executed, because it is a few seconds longer, and there's time to breathe it in. So, here's my take on this movie - The theatrical cut was junk. Get the Bluray for ultimate edition, and you shall not be disappointed. I've seen it so many more times now, and it's the definitive cut. It is the movie we deserve. It's a unique take on Batman, and Superman. It's a gritty take on the superhero movie genre, and definitely the best DCEU movie, and the best DC movie since The Dark Knight.P.S. Yes it's dark. We're adults, and we should appreciate mature film making without intentionally silly moments. It attempts to be philosophical, and something deep instead of just trying to make you chuckle."

"This is one of the best superhero movies ever made. Zack Snyder is a magician behind the camera.The reason behind so many complaints is the fact that Warner Bros. marketed this movie as a fight between Batman and Superman. That's not what it is. It's a movie about the origins of the Justice League.The cinematography, the acting and the score are all second to none. This film is phenomenal.P.S: watch the 3 hour extended cut that Snyder intended you to see, not the 2 and a half hour movie that Warner Bros. decided would be better for theaters."

"I don't care what the critics say, this is a very well-done movie. I'll start my review by listing what I like about the movie.1.) Ben Affleck is the best batman to me and it is not close. He pulls off the role of an aging batman extremely well. Also, Zack Snyder's vision of batman is legit. I have always hated batman up until this adaptation of him. Instead of being a conflicted and idealistic batman, this batman is dark, gritty, and 100% a badass. His equipment is decked out with machine guns and he has no aversion to killing people. In fact, he probably kills about 50 criminal by the time this movie is over. The warehouse scene is the coolest batman scene in any movie.2.) The development of a grudge between batman and superman is pulled off flawlessly. It actually makes sense why batman dislikes superman. Then, when they do fight it is about the coolest thing you can expect to see from a superhero film. 3.) I disagree with a lot of people about Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor. In my opinion, he played his role to perfection. 4.) B v S sets up Wonder Woman and Justice League with Gal Gadot's cameo as Wonder Woman and short clips of Aquaman, the Flash, and Cyborg. B v S is one of my favorite superhero films and rewatching it never gets old."

"The theatrical cut of this film is garbage which is why I rated it eight stars instead of nine. The first time I watched this film I didn't like it (not straight out hate but didn't like). Character motivations didn't make any sense, Lex was annoying as s***, editing was sloppy, and it was overly dark and broody for an action superhero movie. A year + a half, five Marvel films, a ton of bad reviews and a Justice League later a thought popped into my head: \"what if I watched BVS again\". This time I didn't have trailers ruining the best moments, I only vaguely remembered the film, and I was conditioned to look at it negatively but something unexpected happened: I actually loved it. Superman was just a normal person that tried to make a difference cause he could that others imposed their own beliefs on. Lex Luthor was a genius that couldn't stand his powerlessness compared to Superman or more accurately a super being. As Alfred said \"The fever, the rage, the feeling of powerlessness that turns good men... cruel\" and you see the same thought process in Batman. Batman, just like Lex Luthor feels powerless in the midst of a god-being and just like Lex he attempts to destroy him so he can get his sense of power back but unlike Lex, Batman learns something. I what is one of the corniest lines of the movie Superman says, \"Martha\" when he knows he can't win against Batman in a late desperate attempt to save his mother. Not only does this name connect with Bruce Wayne but it also shows what really matters to a man of steel: it isn't power, it isn't fame or anything else, it is his Mother and on a broader scale it is people. Lex (who doesn't care about people at all) knows he doesn't have the power so he creates something from his blood and the remains of Zod: A Doomsday for Superman. Not only does this film have depth but it also doesn't always explain it to you which is rare in a blockbuster action superhero flick normally cater to semi-comic book fans and people that want to shove popcorn in their mouths. This film rewards you for really noticing the details while still having massive explosions. One of my favorites is how Lex has all of Batman's branded killed which is why he isn't afraid of the branding at the end or Grandma's Peach Tea as a way of scaring the s*** out of someone. Of course, this film isn't perfect and I do have personal dislikes. The Batman V Superman fight was slow and pretty boring especially after watching such an amazing fight in Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 2 (If you haven't watched the animated Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 1 and 2 you are sorely missing out on something fantastic). Also, the addition of Wonder Woman who pretty much steals a hacker thing, gives it back and then suits up and fights against a giant monster thing. Not to say I don't like Wonder Woman (She is one of my favorite Superheroes of all time who showed not only can woman kick a** but they also don't need to be ashamed of their sexuality or gender) but she wasn't really that helpful to the plot and just brought in to expand the universe which was well done through Lex's superhuman hunting files. Also, the post-apocalyptic scene that was just a dream could have been cut but nothing is perfect except movies like Citizen Kane which isn't a lot of fun to watch cause it is too perfect. So to summarize, the theatrical cut is bad, the ultimate cut is Amazing and the other cut is meh. Please give it a second chance because it deserves it and save a good director from losing grace because of something he didn't do."
"I really liked it, don't know what all the hate is about. I'm actually a Marvel fan from when I was 7 or so, but Superman and Batman together in 1 movie? Just great. And personally I like Ben Affleck even better than Christian Bale as Batman. So just watch and enjoy, I know I did!"

"That's right. We have been waiting for these two heroes to finally meet and fight against each other. This movie is so good in both plot and special effects.Henry Cavill and Ben Affleck have performed well in their acting stages. They are the best superhero actors and they have filmed their fighting scenes very well. The movie starts to show the conflict between the lives of the heroes and now they have blamed each other for it. This movie is amazing and sets up a good plot for Dawn Justice."

"Actually...I didn't know what to expect. When you see Wonder Woman, you know it will be off of Wonder Woman and off of a Wonder Woman story, but with Batman V Superman, I was like, \"hmmmm, so who is this about?\" It was pretty obvious that it would feature many characters, but I thought the introduction to Batman was amazing. Ben Affleck nailed the part, not only as Batman but also as Bruce Wayne. He is my Batman. Henry Cavill continued to be super as the Man of Steel. And he is my Super - Man. A dark story? Yes, without a doubt. Could it have had a few more jokes? Sure. But not all movies or stories need to have jokes when certain events are serious. I really hope people can see this review and take another look at the movie, because, I loved it. I really hope the ratings can go up, eventually. And P.S, this movie is the perfect set up to Justice League."

"I'll start by making it clear I have only ever seen the Ultimate Edition. I'm aware of what was cut out for the theatrical release, so I will concede up front that most of the criticisms about pacing, editing, and missing bits of plot at release were merited.With that caveat out of the way, I must reiterate that this was bar-none the boldest superhero movie I have ever seen. To me, it was arguably the best as well, though \"best\" shouldn't be taken to mean \"most enjoyable.\" That honor easily goes to \"Thor: Ragnarok.\" What makes BvS stand out among other films in the genre is that it takes two characters who have been done to death since the 1970s and brings them up to date. I recently tried to watch \"Superman: The Movie\" for the first time in a number of years, and while it was still good and Reeves will always be iconic, I just couldn't take it seriously. I'll put it this way: If the story in BvS was \"stupid\" in your view but Superman turning back time by spinning the earth backward on its axis didn't seem like one of the dumbest things you have ever seen -in any movie from any genre- to the extent that it outright ruins the movie for you, then your opinion about BvS isn't worth much. Nostalgic bias was always going to be a problem for this movie, and the way people reacted to and reviewed \"Man of Steel\" was telling in this regard.That brings me to Zack Snyder's take on Superman. You know, that guy whose status as the first extraterrestrial ever encountered by humanity was a total non-issue in the old movies. Apparently, Snyder has a similar view to my own in that his take on the Man of Steel makes his being an alien a core piece of his identity. He may look like any other (absurdly attractive) person, but he knows what he is, and that makes him perpetually uncertain of where he fits in this world. He is essentially good and really does care about people, but he struggles to truly empathize with the likes of us. To be human is to be frail, and that is not something he can easily relate to. This is the root of his conflict with Batman.Just as Clark struggles to genuinely relate to most people, Snyder's Batman either refuses to or otherwise just can't relate to Superman. He doesn't see him as anything but a threat regardless of Superman's clear good intentions. Remember, a small group of Kryptonians were able to bring humanity to the brink of extinction in less than a day, and Bruce Wayne is nothing if not a realist. He didn't know the guy from Kansas. He only knew the god from another world.While Batman's anger toward and fear of Superman are readily apparent from the start, Superman's inability to imagine things from Bruce Wayne's perspective only becomes truly apparent during their first real interaction. This reminded me of the animated version of the \"world's finest\" storyline, where Superman judges Batman harshly for using fear tactics and threats of violence (also, actual violence) to get the job done. Superman wasn't willing to consider what it would take for a human man to fight criminals and save innocents, or what that life would do to him over time. Just as Batman didn't see the guy from Kansas, Superman didn't see the man who lives his life trapped in one brutal, unthinkably traumatic moment (this was beautifully conveyed during the film's opening moments), and had spent his whole adult life bearing witness to humanity at its absolute worst.The conflict between these two characters is as old as human history. They want the same things, but they can't understand one another. So they fight. And what a fight it was.Watching a fight between, say, Captain America and Iron Man was, to me, more frustrating than anything because each understood the other's perspective perfectly. The fight between Batman and Superman in BvS was genuinely gut-wrenching, as intended, because they would have understood one another if either had tried. The whole sequence hilighted Batman's tactical prowess and ability to control a situation. Maybe the most badass thing about the fight was that it ended exactly where Batman planned. That brings me to the big elephant in the room named \"Martha.\"I can't recall exactly which YouTuber put it this way, but if you thought the \"save Martha\" exchange was about their mothers having the same name, you had your brain turned off. The brain-on people have explained this to death, but it bears repeating. This was the moment when Superman became humanized to Batman. He was about to die, and his only concern was for his adoptive human mother. He still believed that the man about to take his life would do the right thing. Even with the cowl on, there was no mistaking the look on Batman's face. It was the look of shame, guilt, and sudden uncertainty that says \"What am I doing?\" Turns out even the most brutal, angry version of Bruce Wayne is better than Tony Stark at knowing right from wrong. At knowing that he had gone too far.From there, the third act was a series of truly impressive (albeit mostly CGI) fight sequences, beginning with what I regard as the undisputed champion of Batman fights. Nothing in the Nolan movies (and especially nothing in the Burton movies) even came close. Go ahead, try to convince yourself that Batman and Bane taking turns punching one another in the face until Bane's mask broke was a good fight sequence. No, this was a fight straight out of \"Arkham Knight,\" and it was glorious. The battle against Doomsday really was one for the books. From the moment Wonder Woman arrived accompanied by the intense sounds of Tina Guo's electric cello to Superman's tragic, heroic death at the hands of Doomsday, I was glued to the screen. Sure, the mere presence of Doomsday spoiled the end to a degree, but watching the Man of Steel laboring to carry that kryptonite spear towards certain death was no less impactful. A brief word on Jesse Eisenberg's take on Lex Luthor. At least one other reviewer on this site already said it best when they pointed out that this was his origin story. If you consider his scheme objectively, he is actually one of the more formidable incarnations of the character. If we're lucky, we'll eventually get to see a Snyder Cut of \"Justice League\" and find out where this story was actually meant to go. For the record, Joss Whedon and Danny Elfman both should have said \"no\" to taking a dump on someone else's art."
"BATMAN V SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE brings a fantastic surprise to a smash-hit team-up with one of the worlds most beloved DC Comics' icons of all time. The movie delivers spectacular casting, and fantastic acting with different characters having their shine in each scenes.The story follows Clark Kent/Superman who becomes a threat, after the destruction in Metropolis in Man Of Steel.(2013). Batman/Bruce Wayne sees him as a threat and begins his war on Superman.The movie brings spectacular storytelling, it tells the complications of human against alien who are on the same side, and the first meeting of Batman and Superman. The story of Bruce Wayne, with his many years of The Caped Crusader, sends him on a spiral of \"out of control\", sheer anger, and builds tension to wanting to defeat the Man of Steel. Snyder has fantastically gave this storytelling an exciting nod to the comics.Lex Luthor, played by Jesse Einsberg, delivers a very interesting performance, but very differently by him showing is his \"origin\" before he becomes a bald foe to the Man of Steel. He shows that his love of \"god vs man\" terrorises mankind when he ultimately creates Doomsday, and Batman realises Superman's inner heroism.It packs so many great \"out of nowhere\" excitement, including a first-look of the fearful Wonder Woman a.k.a. Diana Prince, played by Gal Gadot, and a fresh-new glimpse of the superhero DC canon: The Justice League.WATCH THIS MOVIE! The critics are out of their mind. It's a fun-packed action adventure which still keeps the movie enjoyable until it's final minutes of the movie. It's a FANTASTIC MOVIE! BEN AFFLECK AS BATMAN... is Incredible!A 10/10 overall!"
"I want to go on record as saying that this is a truly thrilling cinematic experience in so many ways. If pressed, I guess I could acknowledge that there were a couple ... let's say \"clumsy\" moments. And in a film that runs to three hours, that hardly seems like a significant issue, certainly not enough to rate it with fewer than 9 stars.This film has everything. There is dramatic tension right from the start. There is a magnificent story arc that picks up quite seamlessly from 'Man of Steel' and propels the viewer not only into the life of Clark Kent/Superman but also of Bruce Wayne/Batman.The villain is no mere cartoon of a villain; he is truly thoroughly (and apparently irrevocably) diabolical. He is a psychopath, and you wish for his death over and over and over. You want Superman to reduce him to ash with the power of his eyes.I have read a number of viewers' reviews, and it seems that the people who disliked the film / gave it a low rating had rather unfair and unrealistic expectations of it. That is, their own prejudices about how the plot could/should unfold or what the character development could/should be, etc. ruined the film for them. And that is a shame.My thought is: I settle into my seat, wait for the lights to dim, and then I wait to be transported by the film. I accept it, lock, stock, and barrel.As another reviewer remarked, I love how the film begins from the point of view of Bruce Wayne as he is among people on the ground who have fallen victim to the attack of Zod and the other Kryptonians.Why would Bruce Wayne not like Superman? Why would the good people of Earth hurl insults at Superman and burn him in effigy (on the news)? Because the good people of Earth just got catapulted into a new reality in which there are not only extraterrestrial beings (surprise!) but they are also superman! And a group of them are hell-bent on destroying humankind and taking the planet for themselves.It is difficult to see Superman as separate from the whole Kryptonian Krew.It seems that many moviegoers forgot that Bruce Wayne is also human. Sure, he's a hero, but he is flawed.. Just like the rest of us. He is a vigilante, after all.He has let his vigilantism get the better of him. HE is actually the one working outside the boundaries of the law, not Superman. It is the clear head of Alfred that shows us that he has gone into a rather dark place, that he has not seen what is really going on (in Luthor's scheme), and so he chooses to embark on his own scheme scheme to take out the alien invader. He is (allegedly) thinking of the future: if he wipes out the all-powerful alien, then it can't turn on humankind in the future. At least, he convinces himself of that.A philosophical question is raised in the film: should Clark Kent have remained a simple man from Kansas and never have become the Superman? Should he just let people die and let calamities happen? The question is answered for us in the character of Diana Prince/Wonder Woman. She withdrew from mankind (her exact words) and just sat around watching. Watching while people died horrible deaths all around her. So, should Superman have done the same? Do these special beings, these 'metahumans', have some kind of moral imperative to intervene, or should they be allowed to be regular people, too? It seems that humans want it both ways.It seems that humans are saying: \"Don't be a superalien ... except when I and my friends and family are in trouble. Then come save us.\""

"Batman v Superman: Ultimate Edition: If your looking for a quick, cheap thrill then you might not enjoy this film at the time. This movies theatrical version was butchered by WB and in doing so reshaped the story leaving numerous plot holes. So the Ultimate Edition is the full story and the one worth seeing. Watch 'Man of Steel' before seeing this movie. There is much to claw through here, so much so that the audience might easily find themselves exhausted from the overall aggression of the film. However, a lot of the story does work. The action is good, and the emotion feels real most of the time.This film is about Superman trying to become Superman. Trying to help the world, save people, find a place in this world not as an outcast, and yet is looked at has a threat by many. Superman is not from this world, yet He is trying to be human, find a place in this world, be excepted by earths people, and come into his destiny.This film is also about Batman being Batman for 20 years and losing faith in humanity, and fearing Superman, what Superman can do with his powers. Great film, great plot, great visuals. ---Yidioo"
"I didn't see the film in the theaters and just bought the \"Extended Edition \" on Amazon. I never properly saw Man of Steel- i think I rented it and watched it when already exhausted and fell asleep. I saw the mediocre user reviews and horrible reviews from critics of this film.They really have it wrong. This is the very best either Batman or Superman. It has a different take, on things. Much darker then earlier films even darker then the Christopher Nolan Batman films.First of all Christopher Nolan is an Executive Producer. So how bad could it be? I loved Sucker Punch and Zack Snyder was involved with that. So how bad could this be? Hans Zimmer did the music, so how bad could it be?I remember watching the old Superman TV shows and reading the Superman and Batman comics as a little kid and loved them, but i wouldn't call myself a \"fan boy\" of comic universes, like so many younger people today. As an older adult I will admit my favorite TV show of all time was Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but watched it on DVD only after it had finished. I saw the second of the Dark Knight series in the theater, but the other two, I watched on DVD. They were great, but not my favorite films like so many people. i also loved the first couple Superman and Batman films in the older series. Regardless, i was not waiting with baited breath to see Man of Steel or this one.I'm more of a serious film fan, who can watch Stanley Kubrick films over and over and my favorite films in the last twenty years, are Eyes Wide Shut and Intersteller, both of which i've watched multiple times.So, with that said, take it from me, the critics have this film very wrong, just as critics hated 2001: A Space Odyssey when it first came out. This film will have lasting appreciation.Surprised how much I liked Ben Afleck's Batman. it was hard to get into Henry Cavil's scrawnier looking Superman, but it grew on me. Amy Adams was great as Lois Lane, The Gal Gadol Wonder Women was amazing. Lex Luther was terrific, like Nolan's Joker. Jeremy Irons was the best Alfred ever. Holly Hunter and Diane Lane was good too. The movie had bad reviews but made a billion dollars. Hopefully everyone buys the Ultimate Edition and it breaks sales records and the film is re-appreciated. I have no idea what scenes this Ultimate Edition added, but it is pretty perfect. Now I can't wait for Wonder Woman and the Justice League and as soon as I finish writing this am going to watch Man of Steal. I'm into it now!I can only surmise that the bad reviews stem from too much expectations of the rigid fan boy types and the radical changes in tone, we see in this film.Total masterpiece of cinema, but I have a few criticisms. There are a few hollow scenes of typical Idiot cops and authorities getting everything wrong in a cliché type way and it has a few filler scenes of that type and a few moments here and there that felt rushed and cheesy. Maybe not everything restored into the Ultimate Edition should have been. I wish there had been more Kevin Costner scenes."

"The whole entire Batman V Superman movie was great and yes even though it felt slow to the majority of the people who watched it but to me I enjoyed every part and every scene of Batman V Superman and when it got to the fight scenes both batman VS Superman and the Doomsday fight it brought so much drama, intensity, and epic performances. So with that being said I give this movie a good 10/10 because it really did go to my expectations and it brought a powerful performance and a powerful yet epic introduction to the upcoming Justice League."

"When I first wrote a review for this movie a year ago exclaiming my excitement for the film, I had been high off a fresh dose of live-action DC superheroes playing out the beloved comic book stories that I had grown up on. It was all playing out before my eyes and coming to life. After a few months had passed, I began to notice things about the movie that I disliked: little gaps in the story, things that didn't add up, etc. My original rating of a 10 / 10 dropped to an 8 /10. But today it has gone back up to a 10. The extended version of the film not only rectifies the gaps but also silences critics.Many claimed that the movie was too dark or that it just didn't make sense. To those people, I say: \"Pick up a comic book!\" Many of the critics of this particular film were part of the superhero bandwagon that formed when Marvel began its spree of Avengers-related films. In fact, its estimated that over 60% of people who go to see 'superhero' genre films have never picked up a comic book in their life. I would argue that similar numbers could figure to those which view the CW televised DC Universe shows. People complain that DC comics is just too dark but the fact is that these movies are based upon actual comics which are meant to be dark (ex: The Dark Knight Returns, Injustice, etc.). Its like complaining that Game of Thrones (the TV series) sucks because they kill off too many characters. Read the books! Its frustrating to see such a beautiful work of art like Batman V Superman criticized by those ignorant to its universe and its meaning. This movie is in fact a catalyst that opens numerous doorways and leaves true fans in awe of the possibilities for future movies. But regardless of whether or not people choose to educate themselves, this film's DVD/Blu-ray extended version puts the theater release to shame. All of the plot holes and gaps are filled in 30 minutes of extended footage scattered throughout the film. The movie ultimately becomes more complete and people will wish that the movie had shown the full 3 hours of footage in its theatrical debut. As a major DC comics fan, I will of course pick up on things that a comics fan would not, but someone who does not read comics would learn to appreciate this film in its entirety with the extended version. Get your hands on a copy today or find it on Netflix or the internet somewhere!"

"I ignored the bad reviews and watched anyways. This film had a lot to live up to after Civil War was released and I went into this film expecting the worst. It ended up to be the best Superhero film of 2016 to me. One complaint was that this film was more concerned about universe building than telling a great story than Civil War but for me it was the other way around; Civil War felt like a build up to something else and to be honest, I felt that way when I saw the other MCU films. Batman vs Superman however not only had a great story, but it also felt a lot more consistent than Civil War. This film was way more diverse with the cast than the MCU but unlike the MCU, I felt like this film doesn't go overboard with the SJW stuff like the MCU films or The Star Wars Sequel films do. The Visuals were AMAZING, The Score by Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL was AMAZING as well, The Tone is just right as I actually felt for the characters emotionally, The Cinematography kept my eyes glued to the screen, and the script felt really Intelligent and Complex and despite people calling the writing confusing, I was able to piece it together with no problem whatsoever. This film is similar to Empire Strikes back in terms of popularity so over time after the other movies are released, this movie would probably be more popular.This film was way better than I Expected and deserves another chance.

"Its shame to see what critics and marvel fans did to this movie and targeted Zack Snyder for it. I have seen this movie more than 25 times till date. And i enjoy this movie as much as i enjoyed the first time. The fans who have read DC comics, wouldn't be disappointed in this movie. Its dark movie, yes it is. Because the title shows the intense situation at hand. Two superheroes about to rip each other apart for whatever reasons that brought them to this stage. Yes it had to be dark and intense.Only marvel can be stupid enough to show an alien invasion where humans are loosing the battle and the super heroes are cracking jokes while battles as if they are playing ping pong. a person playing Call of Duty game is more serious while playing than the marvel heroes fighting aliens."

"Last week some news came out from somebody online who had claimed to have seen a finished version of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. If you were like me, you've been leery of checking it out because you weren't sure how much might actually be true. Now Zack Snyder has spoken out about the spoiler-filled post, although his response doesn't really clear anything up.In a word, to MTV, he called the post \"hilarious,which might imply that he's saying that it's mostly, if not entirely, untrue. That might be the case, but then again he could have just said it was untrue and he didn't say that. What he did say, however, is that he doesn't like spoilers. While this may seem odd for the director who's most recent trailer appeared to give away the entire movie, Snyder says that's not the case. Even if you've seen the trailer, you can rest easy, as there is much more we have not seen in then finished film. Says Snyder I have the benefit of seeing the movie. It's cool that think it's too much, and I appreciate people not wanting to know, but there's plenty that they don't know. There's a lot of movie that's not in the trailer. In the process of calling the Batman v Superman Reddit review hilarious, Snyder goes on to talk about how he hates it when spoilers come out. The director would much rather that fans see the movie mostly blind. While he understands that some fans may wish to find the answers before hand, he wants his movies to be mysteries going in. If you're, as an audience member, exploring these articles, looking for answers to questions that you have, maybe you're okay with knowing before you go. It's like an individual taste. But like I said, I want people to see the movie without knowing.Spoilers are a topic that mean different things to different people. While most try to avoid them to some degree, the need to solve the mystery is a nearly universal human experience. We have an inclination to want to know the truth, even while also wanting to be surprised. For most of us getting some information is good, but getting all the information is bad, of course, only getting the details that you want can be difficult."
"The theatrical is choppy, poorly edited, hard to follow, with some really good moments mixed in their. The extended is much more fluent and is much easier to follow, it does have a long runtime, which might make it seem a bit dragging on, but if you like long films done right, like Lord of the Rings, you will like this movie as long as you get into the characters and story. Speaking of which, the story starts out perfectly showing Bruce Wayne as a character, and it is very powerful. There are several moments in this movie that are powerful, emotional, and shocking. Characters. Batman is my favorite fictional character of all time, and believe me when I say, Ben Affleck as Batman was perfect, he had the charisma, the anger, and the look of being through some bad stuff Gal Gadot also does perfect as Wonder Woman, but if you want to really see how good she does, go watch the Wonder Woman movie. Henry Call as Superman. I really don't like it when people say Christopher Reeves is better. Don't get me wrong, Reeves does great, but can you imagine him as Superman in this movie? I wouldn't like it. It would be like Adam West playing Batman in The Dark Knight. Henry Cavill does great in this role, I can say everything about him as I said with Ben Affleck. Jesse Eisenberg as Luthor. I thought it was different in a good way. I've heard a criticism for him as being too much like Joker, but is that a bad thing? Joker is my favorite villain, so to see Superman have an enemy that crazy, but still hold the values Luthor needs to be Luthor, I think it is great. The thing I thought this movie was lacking in the first and second acts was humor, at least good humor. If there was more humor, I would've given this movie a ten because it would give a more relaxing feel to the parts that needed it. All in all though, this movie was awesome, it had powerful moments, it was badass, and just plain fun. It had a great story arc and does its job very well."

"*I will be talking about the Ultimate Edition of the film* This was one of the most anticipated CBM of all time. Ever since the arrival and subsequent success of Marvel's The Avengers people have wondered when will DC launch its own cinematic universe, one of the main reasons being the opportunity to finally see titans such as Batman and Superman share the screen together: the ultimate nerd dream. On 2016, the moment finally came for BvS to be released AND.. it performed poorly. Not only did critical reception left a lot to be desired, but fan reactions where surprisingly split after its cinematic debut. People either loved it and called Zack a genius, or hated it and called him a hack. Me, personally, I found myself with middle of the road feelings, for sure, but more leaning towards the negative side with subsequent viewings. The theatrical cut of the film showcased amazing performances, incredible visuals, and action set pieces that seemed like comic book panels come to life, in a good way. However, when it comes to its narrative structure and more technical aspects like editing, the film was seriously flawed. More plot holes than Age of Ultron, questionable character decisions, random editing that lacked cohesion and focus, and forced dramatic moments that lacked any impact because the attempts at character development ranged from limited to nonexistent, especially when it comes to Superman's character. I thought it was a 5/10 movie at best. As such, I was kind of skeptical about the idea of a 30 minute longer version. I say kind of because I know how Zack works. I remember Watchmen being vastly improved with its director's cut, so in a way I was expecting BvS to perform in a similar manner, but I also feared those 30 minutes wold be just there to amplify action and discredit storytelling issues. Oh boy, I'm so glad I was proved wrong. The ultimate cut of the film was infuriating, but not because it was awful, but because it questions the sanity of WB executives and editors and makes you wonder what were they thinking during the editing process. What I got out of the Ultimate Edition was a thought-provoking deconstruction of two very iconic superheroes that gave spotlight to the struggles both of them face when they aren't fighting crime. What I got was an extremely well produced character study on both Batman and Superman in a cynical world, a world dangerously close to our own. We meet Batman as a ruthless, worn out hero that has seen the failure behind his ideals and witnessed some truly horrifying things in his life. Superman, on the other hand, is portrayed as a godlike figure that seeks to do good in the world, but finds himself emotionally conflicted once he realized that every good deed he does leaves behind a trail of destruction (most of it due to Luthor's antics). In my opinion, this is a hugely original approach, one that distances itself from the rest of the competition and delivers a dark, somber, yet relevant superhero movie that understands both characters and gives them real human struggles to deal with. I felt invested in both of them, and hoped that by the end of the film both could find a way to redeem themselves. Their character arcs were very well established during the first two acts of the movie, and by the time we get to the titular climactic battle the emotion behind the jaw-dropping action is intensified. Lex Luthor as a villain was also given more time to develop with this new edition. One of the main criticisms with the original version was the fact that his plan relied too much on conveniences, and the character's mannerisms and mad-scientist attitude was annoying, and that goes without saying his motivations were unclear. Not only do we spend more time understanding his hate for any godlike figure and thus his hatred for Superman, but the added scenes allowed us to witness his entire plan come to fruition. It sells the cold, manipulative, calculating attributes of his comic counterpart. The acting is spot on. Every actor owns his/her role, from Cavill's Superman, to Ben Affleck as Batman, Eisenberg as Luthor, and Gadot as Wonder Woman, whose scenes are brief, but are more than enough to sell the strong and ferocious warrior that she is. Cinematography is stunning, and miles above that of Man of Steel's. And the soundtrack by Zimmer and Junkie XL? Perfect, just perfect. When it comes to flaws, the film still has some of those. The Martha moment, while serving as a pivotal character moment for Batman, felt off in execution, and its understandable that many people got mad at it. If your main complaint about BvS the first time around was its bleak tone and subject matter, this film is still not for you. I understand most were expecting to see the heroes being the most iconic versions of themselves, clashing in an elongated battle and evoking the same feelings The Avengers gave audiences back in 2012. In that sense, the film will remain divisive, but at least I have the comfort of saying that, at the very least, the film is competently made."

"This film was amazing. Ben Affleck was easily the best part of this movie, he brought his a-game as Batman. The chemistry between Affleck & Irons was outstanding. Gal Gadot did a great job as Wonder Woman. The fight between Batman & Superman was awesome. The final fight with Doomsday was outstanding in every way possible. However, there is only one problem with this film and that's Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor. He was sadly missed cast in this role, but then again it's really the fault of Warner Bros. Studios. Overall, this film deliver on almost every level. I highly recommend that you watch the extended version of this film."

"I know I know. I saw it in theaters too, and felt like it could've been so much better. While the Batman element was good, the narrative felt fractured, and the third act was just one long stunt scene. Superman was relegated to a supporting character, and other characters didn't get a chance to shine. And then I chanced on the ultimate cut. Calling it 30 mins of \"extra\" footage is unfair to Zack Snyder because it's exactly these 30 mins that makes the movie a worthy one. What I can say about the theatrical cut is this - It had the blockbuster elements - music, visuals, stunts, CGI. But, it lacked the human elements. The first 20 mins of the movie had it, but not after that. The extended cut in comparison has a flow to the narrative. There are no disjointed scenes, everything flows smoothly, and there's connective tissue. Superman gets to spend some time with his father, and mother. Clark Kent does some investigative journalism. Superman helps the people after the blast. Lois Lane doesn't jump to conclusions, she gets to the bottom of the crime. Lex Luthor apparently had a coherent plan - everything is explained pretty well. Wonder Woman was already good, so there's no change there :) Also, the \"Martha\" scene seems better executed, because it is a few seconds longer, and there's time to breathe it in. So, here's my take on this movie - The theatrical cut was junk. Get the Bluray for ultimate edition, and you shall not be disappointed. I've seen it so many more times now, and it's the definitive cut. It is the movie we deserve. It's a unique take on Batman, and Superman. It's a gritty take on the superhero movie genre, and definitely the best DCEU movie, and the best DC movie since The Dark Knight.P.S. Yes it's dark. We're adults, and we should appreciate mature film making without intentionally silly moments. It attempts to be philosophical, and something deep instead of just trying to make you chuckle."

"This is one of the best superhero movies ever made. Zack Snyder is a magician behind the camera.The reason behind so many complaints is the fact that Warner Bros. marketed this movie as a fight between Batman and Superman. That's not what it is. It's a movie about the origins of the Justice League.The cinematography, the acting and the score are all second to none. This film is phenomenal.P.S: watch the 3 hour extended cut that Snyder intended you to see, not the 2 and a half hour movie that Warner Bros. decided would be better for theaters."

"I don't care what the critics say, this is a very well-done movie. I'll start my review by listing what I like about the movie.1.) Ben Affleck is the best batman to me and it is not close. He pulls off the role of an aging batman extremely well. Also, Zack Snyder's vision of batman is legit. I have always hated batman up until this adaptation of him. Instead of being a conflicted and idealistic batman, this batman is dark, gritty, and 100% a badass. His equipment is decked out with machine guns and he has no aversion to killing people. In fact, he probably kills about 50 criminal by the time this movie is over. The warehouse scene is the coolest batman scene in any movie.2.) The development of a grudge between batman and superman is pulled off flawlessly. It actually makes sense why batman dislikes superman. Then, when they do fight it is about the coolest thing you can expect to see from a superhero film. 3.) I disagree with a lot of people about Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor. In my opinion, he played his role to perfection. 4.) B v S sets up Wonder Woman and Justice League with Gal Gadot's cameo as Wonder Woman and short clips of Aquaman, the Flash, and Cyborg. B v S is one of my favorite superhero films and rewatching it never gets old."

"The theatrical cut of this film is garbage which is why I rated it eight stars instead of nine. The first time I watched this film I didn't like it (not straight out hate but didn't like). Character motivations didn't make any sense, Lex was annoying as s***, editing was sloppy, and it was overly dark and broody for an action superhero movie. A year + a half, five Marvel films, a ton of bad reviews and a Justice League later a thought popped into my head: \"what if I watched BVS again\". This time I didn't have trailers ruining the best moments, I only vaguely remembered the film, and I was conditioned to look at it negatively but something unexpected happened: I actually loved it. Superman was just a normal person that tried to make a difference cause he could that others imposed their own beliefs on. Lex Luthor was a genius that couldn't stand his powerlessness compared to Superman or more accurately a super being. As Alfred said \"The fever, the rage, the feeling of powerlessness that turns good men... cruel\" and you see the same thought process in Batman. Batman, just like Lex Luthor feels powerless in the midst of a god-being and just like Lex he attempts to destroy him so he can get his sense of power back but unlike Lex, Batman learns something. I what is one of the corniest lines of the movie Superman says, \"Martha\" when he knows he can't win against Batman in a late desperate attempt to save his mother. Not only does this name connect with Bruce Wayne but it also shows what really matters to a man of steel: it isn't power, it isn't fame or anything else, it is his Mother and on a broader scale it is people. Lex (who doesn't care about people at all) knows he doesn't have the power so he creates something from his blood and the remains of Zod: A Doomsday for Superman. Not only does this film have depth but it also doesn't always explain it to you which is rare in a blockbuster action superhero flick normally cater to semi-comic book fans and people that want to shove popcorn in their mouths. This film rewards you for really noticing the details while still having massive explosions. One of my favorites is how Lex has all of Batman's branded killed which is why he isn't afraid of the branding at the end or Grandma's Peach Tea as a way of scaring the s*** out of someone. Of course, this film isn't perfect and I do have personal dislikes. The Batman V Superman fight was slow and pretty boring especially after watching such an amazing fight in Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 2 (If you haven't watched the animated Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 1 and 2 you are sorely missing out on something fantastic). Also, the addition of Wonder Woman who pretty much steals a hacker thing, gives it back and then suits up and fights against a giant monster thing. Not to say I don't like Wonder Woman (She is one of my favorite Superheroes of all time who showed not only can woman kick a** but they also don't need to be ashamed of their sexuality or gender) but she wasn't really that helpful to the plot and just brought in to expand the universe which was well done through Lex's superhuman hunting files. Also, the post-apocalyptic scene that was just a dream could have been cut but nothing is perfect except movies like Citizen Kane which isn't a lot of fun to watch cause it is too perfect. So to summarize, the theatrical cut is bad, the ultimate cut is Amazing and the other cut is meh. Please give it a second chance because it deserves it and save a good director from losing grace because of something he didn't do."
"I really liked it, don't know what all the hate is about. I'm actually a Marvel fan from when I was 7 or so, but Superman and Batman together in 1 movie? Just great. And personally I like Ben Affleck even better than Christian Bale as Batman. So just watch and enjoy, I know I did!"

"That's right. We have been waiting for these two heroes to finally meet and fight against each other. This movie is so good in both plot and special effects.Henry Cavill and Ben Affleck have performed well in their acting stages. They are the best superhero actors and they have filmed their fighting scenes very well. The movie starts to show the conflict between the lives of the heroes and now they have blamed each other for it. This movie is amazing and sets up a good plot for Dawn Justice."

"Actually...I didn't know what to expect. When you see Wonder Woman, you know it will be off of Wonder Woman and off of a Wonder Woman story, but with Batman V Superman, I was like, \"hmmmm, so who is this about?\" It was pretty obvious that it would feature many characters, but I thought the introduction to Batman was amazing. Ben Affleck nailed the part, not only as Batman but also as Bruce Wayne. He is my Batman. Henry Cavill continued to be super as the Man of Steel. And he is my Super - Man. A dark story? Yes, without a doubt. Could it have had a few more jokes? Sure. But not all movies or stories need to have jokes when certain events are serious. I really hope people can see this review and take another look at the movie, because, I loved it. I really hope the ratings can go up, eventually. And P.S, this movie is the perfect set up to Justice League."

"I'll start by making it clear I have only ever seen the Ultimate Edition. I'm aware of what was cut out for the theatrical release, so I will concede up front that most of the criticisms about pacing, editing, and missing bits of plot at release were merited.With that caveat out of the way, I must reiterate that this was bar-none the boldest superhero movie I have ever seen. To me, it was arguably the best as well, though \"best\" shouldn't be taken to mean \"most enjoyable.\" That honor easily goes to \"Thor: Ragnarok.\" What makes BvS stand out among other films in the genre is that it takes two characters who have been done to death since the 1970s and brings them up to date. I recently tried to watch \"Superman: The Movie\" for the first time in a number of years, and while it was still good and Reeves will always be iconic, I just couldn't take it seriously. I'll put it this way: If the story in BvS was \"stupid\" in your view but Superman turning back time by spinning the earth backward on its axis didn't seem like one of the dumbest things you have ever seen -in any movie from any genre- to the extent that it outright ruins the movie for you, then your opinion about BvS isn't worth much. Nostalgic bias was always going to be a problem for this movie, and the way people reacted to and reviewed \"Man of Steel\" was telling in this regard.That brings me to Zack Snyder's take on Superman. You know, that guy whose status as the first extraterrestrial ever encountered by humanity was a total non-issue in the old movies. Apparently, Snyder has a similar view to my own in that his take on the Man of Steel makes his being an alien a core piece of his identity. He may look like any other (absurdly attractive) person, but he knows what he is, and that makes him perpetually uncertain of where he fits in this world. He is essentially good and really does care about people, but he struggles to truly empathize with the likes of us. To be human is to be frail, and that is not something he can easily relate to. This is the root of his conflict with Batman.Just as Clark struggles to genuinely relate to most people, Snyder's Batman either refuses to or otherwise just can't relate to Superman. He doesn't see him as anything but a threat regardless of Superman's clear good intentions. Remember, a small group of Kryptonians were able to bring humanity to the brink of extinction in less than a day, and Bruce Wayne is nothing if not a realist. He didn't know the guy from Kansas. He only knew the god from another world.While Batman's anger toward and fear of Superman are readily apparent from the start, Superman's inability to imagine things from Bruce Wayne's perspective only becomes truly apparent during their first real interaction. This reminded me of the animated version of the \"world's finest\" storyline, where Superman judges Batman harshly for using fear tactics and threats of violence (also, actual violence) to get the job done. Superman wasn't willing to consider what it would take for a human man to fight criminals and save innocents, or what that life would do to him over time. Just as Batman didn't see the guy from Kansas, Superman didn't see the man who lives his life trapped in one brutal, unthinkably traumatic moment (this was beautifully conveyed during the film's opening moments), and had spent his whole adult life bearing witness to humanity at its absolute worst.The conflict between these two characters is as old as human history. They want the same things, but they can't understand one another. So they fight. And what a fight it was.Watching a fight between, say, Captain America and Iron Man was, to me, more frustrating than anything because each understood the other's perspective perfectly. The fight between Batman and Superman in BvS was genuinely gut-wrenching, as intended, because they would have understood one another if either had tried. The whole sequence hilighted Batman's tactical prowess and ability to control a situation. Maybe the most badass thing about the fight was that it ended exactly where Batman planned. That brings me to the big elephant in the room named \"Martha.\"I can't recall exactly which YouTuber put it this way, but if you thought the \"save Martha\" exchange was about their mothers having the same name, you had your brain turned off. The brain-on people have explained this to death, but it bears repeating. This was the moment when Superman became humanized to Batman. He was about to die, and his only concern was for his adoptive human mother. He still believed that the man about to take his life would do the right thing. Even with the cowl on, there was no mistaking the look on Batman's face. It was the look of shame, guilt, and sudden uncertainty that says \"What am I doing?\" Turns out even the most brutal, angry version of Bruce Wayne is better than Tony Stark at knowing right from wrong. At knowing that he had gone too far.From there, the third act was a series of truly impressive (albeit mostly CGI) fight sequences, beginning with what I regard as the undisputed champion of Batman fights. Nothing in the Nolan movies (and especially nothing in the Burton movies) even came close. Go ahead, try to convince yourself that Batman and Bane taking turns punching one another in the face until Bane's mask broke was a good fight sequence. No, this was a fight straight out of \"Arkham Knight,\" and it was glorious. The battle against Doomsday really was one for the books. From the moment Wonder Woman arrived accompanied by the intense sounds of Tina Guo's electric cello to Superman's tragic, heroic death at the hands of Doomsday, I was glued to the screen. Sure, the mere presence of Doomsday spoiled the end to a degree, but watching the Man of Steel laboring to carry that kryptonite spear towards certain death was no less impactful. A brief word on Jesse Eisenberg's take on Lex Luthor. At least one other reviewer on this site already said it best when they pointed out that this was his origin story. If you consider his scheme objectively, he is actually one of the more formidable incarnations of the character. If we're lucky, we'll eventually get to see a Snyder Cut of \"Justice League\" and find out where this story was actually meant to go. For the record, Joss Whedon and Danny Elfman both should have said \"no\" to taking a dump on someone else's art."
"BATMAN V SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE brings a fantastic surprise to a smash-hit team-up with one of the worlds most beloved DC Comics' icons of all time. The movie delivers spectacular casting, and fantastic acting with different characters having their shine in each scenes.The story follows Clark Kent/Superman who becomes a threat, after the destruction in Metropolis in Man Of Steel.(2013). Batman/Bruce Wayne sees him as a threat and begins his war on Superman.The movie brings spectacular storytelling, it tells the complications of human against alien who are on the same side, and the first meeting of Batman and Superman. The story of Bruce Wayne, with his many years of The Caped Crusader, sends him on a spiral of \"out of control\", sheer anger, and builds tension to wanting to defeat the Man of Steel. Snyder has fantastically gave this storytelling an exciting nod to the comics.Lex Luthor, played by Jesse Einsberg, delivers a very interesting performance, but very differently by him showing is his \"origin\" before he becomes a bald foe to the Man of Steel. He shows that his love of \"god vs man\" terrorises mankind when he ultimately creates Doomsday, and Batman realises Superman's inner heroism.It packs so many great \"out of nowhere\" excitement, including a first-look of the fearful Wonder Woman a.k.a. Diana Prince, played by Gal Gadot, and a fresh-new glimpse of the superhero DC canon: The Justice League.WATCH THIS MOVIE! The critics are out of their mind. It's a fun-packed action adventure which still keeps the movie enjoyable until it's final minutes of the movie. It's a FANTASTIC MOVIE! BEN AFFLECK AS BATMAN... is Incredible!A 10/10 overall!"
"I want to go on record as saying that this is a truly thrilling cinematic experience in so many ways. If pressed, I guess I could acknowledge that there were a couple ... let's say \"clumsy\" moments. And in a film that runs to three hours, that hardly seems like a significant issue, certainly not enough to rate it with fewer than 9 stars.This film has everything. There is dramatic tension right from the start. There is a magnificent story arc that picks up quite seamlessly from 'Man of Steel' and propels the viewer not only into the life of Clark Kent/Superman but also of Bruce Wayne/Batman.The villain is no mere cartoon of a villain; he is truly thoroughly (and apparently irrevocably) diabolical. He is a psychopath, and you wish for his death over and over and over. You want Superman to reduce him to ash with the power of his eyes.I have read a number of viewers' reviews, and it seems that the people who disliked the film / gave it a low rating had rather unfair and unrealistic expectations of it. That is, their own prejudices about how the plot could/should unfold or what the character development could/should be, etc. ruined the film for them. And that is a shame.My thought is: I settle into my seat, wait for the lights to dim, and then I wait to be transported by the film. I accept it, lock, stock, and barrel.As another reviewer remarked, I love how the film begins from the point of view of Bruce Wayne as he is among people on the ground who have fallen victim to the attack of Zod and the other Kryptonians.Why would Bruce Wayne not like Superman? Why would the good people of Earth hurl insults at Superman and burn him in effigy (on the news)? Because the good people of Earth just got catapulted into a new reality in which there are not only extraterrestrial beings (surprise!) but they are also superman! And a group of them are hell-bent on destroying humankind and taking the planet for themselves.It is difficult to see Superman as separate from the whole Kryptonian Krew.It seems that many moviegoers forgot that Bruce Wayne is also human. Sure, he's a hero, but he is flawed.. Just like the rest of us. He is a vigilante, after all.He has let his vigilantism get the better of him. HE is actually the one working outside the boundaries of the law, not Superman. It is the clear head of Alfred that shows us that he has gone into a rather dark place, that he has not seen what is really going on (in Luthor's scheme), and so he chooses to embark on his own scheme scheme to take out the alien invader. He is (allegedly) thinking of the future: if he wipes out the all-powerful alien, then it can't turn on humankind in the future. At least, he convinces himself of that.A philosophical question is raised in the film: should Clark Kent have remained a simple man from Kansas and never have become the Superman? Should he just let people die and let calamities happen? The question is answered for us in the character of Diana Prince/Wonder Woman. She withdrew from mankind (her exact words) and just sat around watching. Watching while people died horrible deaths all around her. So, should Superman have done the same? Do these special beings, these 'metahumans', have some kind of moral imperative to intervene, or should they be allowed to be regular people, too? It seems that humans want it both ways.It seems that humans are saying: \"Don't be a superalien ... except when I and my friends and family are in trouble. Then come save us.\""

"Batman v Superman: Ultimate Edition: If your looking for a quick, cheap thrill then you might not enjoy this film at the time. This movies theatrical version was butchered by WB and in doing so reshaped the story leaving numerous plot holes. So the Ultimate Edition is the full story and the one worth seeing. Watch 'Man of Steel' before seeing this movie. There is much to claw through here, so much so that the audience might easily find themselves exhausted from the overall aggression of the film. However, a lot of the story does work. The action is good, and the emotion feels real most of the time.This film is about Superman trying to become Superman. Trying to help the world, save people, find a place in this world not as an outcast, and yet is looked at has a threat by many. Superman is not from this world, yet He is trying to be human, find a place in this world, be excepted by earths people, and come into his destiny.This film is also about Batman being Batman for 20 years and losing faith in humanity, and fearing Superman, what Superman can do with his powers. Great film, great plot, great visuals. ---Yidioo"
"I didn't see the film in the theaters and just bought the \"Extended Edition \" on Amazon. I never properly saw Man of Steel- i think I rented it and watched it when already exhausted and fell asleep. I saw the mediocre user reviews and horrible reviews from critics of this film.They really have it wrong. This is the very best either Batman or Superman. It has a different take, on things. Much darker then earlier films even darker then the Christopher Nolan Batman films.First of all Christopher Nolan is an Executive Producer. So how bad could it be? I loved Sucker Punch and Zack Snyder was involved with that. So how bad could this be? Hans Zimmer did the music, so how bad could it be?I remember watching the old Superman TV shows and reading the Superman and Batman comics as a little kid and loved them, but i wouldn't call myself a \"fan boy\" of comic universes, like so many younger people today. As an older adult I will admit my favorite TV show of all time was Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but watched it on DVD only after it had finished. I saw the second of the Dark Knight series in the theater, but the other two, I watched on DVD. They were great, but not my favorite films like so many people. i also loved the first couple Superman and Batman films in the older series. Regardless, i was not waiting with baited breath to see Man of Steel or this one.I'm more of a serious film fan, who can watch Stanley Kubrick films over and over and my favorite films in the last twenty years, are Eyes Wide Shut and Intersteller, both of which i've watched multiple times.So, with that said, take it from me, the critics have this film very wrong, just as critics hated 2001: A Space Odyssey when it first came out. This film will have lasting appreciation.Surprised how much I liked Ben Afleck's Batman. it was hard to get into Henry Cavil's scrawnier looking Superman, but it grew on me. Amy Adams was great as Lois Lane, The Gal Gadol Wonder Women was amazing. Lex Luther was terrific, like Nolan's Joker. Jeremy Irons was the best Alfred ever. Holly Hunter and Diane Lane was good too. The movie had bad reviews but made a billion dollars. Hopefully everyone buys the Ultimate Edition and it breaks sales records and the film is re-appreciated. I have no idea what scenes this Ultimate Edition added, but it is pretty perfect. Now I can't wait for Wonder Woman and the Justice League and as soon as I finish writing this am going to watch Man of Steal. I'm into it now!I can only surmise that the bad reviews stem from too much expectations of the rigid fan boy types and the radical changes in tone, we see in this film.Total masterpiece of cinema, but I have a few criticisms. There are a few hollow scenes of typical Idiot cops and authorities getting everything wrong in a cliché type way and it has a few filler scenes of that type and a few moments here and there that felt rushed and cheesy. Maybe not everything restored into the Ultimate Edition should have been. I wish there had been more Kevin Costner scenes."

"The whole entire Batman V Superman movie was great and yes even though it felt slow to the majority of the people who watched it but to me I enjoyed every part and every scene of Batman V Superman and when it got to the fight scenes both batman VS Superman and the Doomsday fight it brought so much drama, intensity, and epic performances. So with that being said I give this movie a good 10/10 because it really did go to my expectations and it brought a powerful performance and a powerful yet epic introduction to the upcoming Justice League."

"When I first wrote a review for this movie a year ago exclaiming my excitement for the film, I had been high off a fresh dose of live-action DC superheroes playing out the beloved comic book stories that I had grown up on. It was all playing out before my eyes and coming to life. After a few months had passed, I began to notice things about the movie that I disliked: little gaps in the story, things that didn't add up, etc. My original rating of a 10 / 10 dropped to an 8 /10. But today it has gone back up to a 10. The extended version of the film not only rectifies the gaps but also silences critics.Many claimed that the movie was too dark or that it just didn't make sense. To those people, I say: \"Pick up a comic book!\" Many of the critics of this particular film were part of the superhero bandwagon that formed when Marvel began its spree of Avengers-related films. In fact, its estimated that over 60% of people who go to see 'superhero' genre films have never picked up a comic book in their life. I would argue that similar numbers could figure to those which view the CW televised DC Universe shows. People complain that DC comics is just too dark but the fact is that these movies are based upon actual comics which are meant to be dark (ex: The Dark Knight Returns, Injustice, etc.). Its like complaining that Game of Thrones (the TV series) sucks because they kill off too many characters. Read the books! Its frustrating to see such a beautiful work of art like Batman V Superman criticized by those ignorant to its universe and its meaning. This movie is in fact a catalyst that opens numerous doorways and leaves true fans in awe of the possibilities for future movies. But regardless of whether or not people choose to educate themselves, this film's DVD/Blu-ray extended version puts the theater release to shame. All of the plot holes and gaps are filled in 30 minutes of extended footage scattered throughout the film. The movie ultimately becomes more complete and people will wish that the movie had shown the full 3 hours of footage in its theatrical debut. As a major DC comics fan, I will of course pick up on things that a comics fan would not, but someone who does not read comics would learn to appreciate this film in its entirety with the extended version. Get your hands on a copy today or find it on Netflix or the internet somewhere!"

"I ignored the bad reviews and watched anyways. This film had a lot to live up to after Civil War was released and I went into this film expecting the worst. It ended up to be the best Superhero film of 2016 to me. One complaint was that this film was more concerned about universe building than telling a great story than Civil War but for me it was the other way around; Civil War felt like a build up to something else and to be honest, I felt that way when I saw the other MCU films. Batman vs Superman however not only had a great story, but it also felt a lot more consistent than Civil War. This film was way more diverse with the cast than the MCU but unlike the MCU, I felt like this film doesn't go overboard with the SJW stuff like the MCU films or The Star Wars Sequel films do. The Visuals were AMAZING, The Score by Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL was AMAZING as well, The Tone is just right as I actually felt for the characters emotionally, The Cinematography kept my eyes glued to the screen, and the script felt really Intelligent and Complex and despite people calling the writing confusing, I was able to piece it together with no problem whatsoever. This film is similar to Empire Strikes back in terms of popularity so over time after the other movies are released, this movie would probably be more popular.This film was way better than I Expected and deserves another chance.

"Its shame to see what critics and marvel fans did to this movie and targeted Zack Snyder for it. I have seen this movie more than 25 times till date. And i enjoy this movie as much as i enjoyed the first time. The fans who have read DC comics, wouldn't be disappointed in this movie. Its dark movie, yes it is. Because the title shows the intense situation at hand. Two superheroes about to rip each other apart for whatever reasons that brought them to this stage. Yes it had to be dark and intense.Only marvel can be stupid enough to show an alien invasion where humans are loosing the battle and the super heroes are cracking jokes while battles as if they are playing ping pong. a person playing Call of Duty game is more serious while playing than the marvel heroes fighting aliens."

"Last week some news came out from somebody online who had claimed to have seen a finished version of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. If you were like me, you've been leery of checking it out because you weren't sure how much might actually be true. Now Zack Snyder has spoken out about the spoiler-filled post, although his response doesn't really clear anything up.In a word, to MTV, he called the post \"hilarious,which might imply that he's saying that it's mostly, if not entirely, untrue. That might be the case, but then again he could have just said it was untrue and he didn't say that. What he did say, however, is that he doesn't like spoilers. While this may seem odd for the director who's most recent trailer appeared to give away the entire movie, Snyder says that's not the case. Even if you've seen the trailer, you can rest easy, as there is much more we have not seen in then finished film. Says Snyder I have the benefit of seeing the movie. It's cool that think it's too much, and I appreciate people not wanting to know, but there's plenty that they don't know. There's a lot of movie that's not in the trailer. In the process of calling the Batman v Superman Reddit review hilarious, Snyder goes on to talk about how he hates it when spoilers come out. The director would much rather that fans see the movie mostly blind. While he understands that some fans may wish to find the answers before hand, he wants his movies to be mysteries going in. If you're, as an audience member, exploring these articles, looking for answers to questions that you have, maybe you're okay with knowing before you go. It's like an individual taste. But like I said, I want people to see the movie without knowing.Spoilers are a topic that mean different things to different people. While most try to avoid them to some degree, the need to solve the mystery is a nearly universal human experience. We have an inclination to want to know the truth, even while also wanting to be surprised. For most of us getting some information is good, but getting all the information is bad, of course, only getting the details that you want can be difficult."
"The theatrical is choppy, poorly edited, hard to follow, with some really good moments mixed in their. The extended is much more fluent and is much easier to follow, it does have a long runtime, which might make it seem a bit dragging on, but if you like long films done right, like Lord of the Rings, you will like this movie as long as you get into the characters and story. Speaking of which, the story starts out perfectly showing Bruce Wayne as a character, and it is very powerful. There are several moments in this movie that are powerful, emotional, and shocking. Characters. Batman is my favorite fictional character of all time, and believe me when I say, Ben Affleck as Batman was perfect, he had the charisma, the anger, and the look of being through some bad stuff Gal Gadot also does perfect as Wonder Woman, but if you want to really see how good she does, go watch the Wonder Woman movie. Henry Call as Superman. I really don't like it when people say Christopher Reeves is better. Don't get me wrong, Reeves does great, but can you imagine him as Superman in this movie? I wouldn't like it. It would be like Adam West playing Batman in The Dark Knight. Henry Cavill does great in this role, I can say everything about him as I said with Ben Affleck. Jesse Eisenberg as Luthor. I thought it was different in a good way. I've heard a criticism for him as being too much like Joker, but is that a bad thing? Joker is my favorite villain, so to see Superman have an enemy that crazy, but still hold the values Luthor needs to be Luthor, I think it is great. The thing I thought this movie was lacking in the first and second acts was humor, at least good humor. If there was more humor, I would've given this movie a ten because it would give a more relaxing feel to the parts that needed it. All in all though, this movie was awesome, it had powerful moments, it was badass, and just plain fun. It had a great story arc and does its job very well."

"*I will be talking about the Ultimate Edition of the film* This was one of the most anticipated CBM of all time. Ever since the arrival and subsequent success of Marvel's The Avengers people have wondered when will DC launch its own cinematic universe, one of the main reasons being the opportunity to finally see titans such as Batman and Superman share the screen together: the ultimate nerd dream. On 2016, the moment finally came for BvS to be released AND.. it performed poorly. Not only did critical reception left a lot to be desired, but fan reactions where surprisingly split after its cinematic debut. People either loved it and called Zack a genius, or hated it and called him a hack. Me, personally, I found myself with middle of the road feelings, for sure, but more leaning towards the negative side with subsequent viewings. The theatrical cut of the film showcased amazing performances, incredible visuals, and action set pieces that seemed like comic book panels come to life, in a good way. However, when it comes to its narrative structure and more technical aspects like editing, the film was seriously flawed. More plot holes than Age of Ultron, questionable character decisions, random editing that lacked cohesion and focus, and forced dramatic moments that lacked any impact because the attempts at character development ranged from limited to nonexistent, especially when it comes to Superman's character. I thought it was a 5/10 movie at best. As such, I was kind of skeptical about the idea of a 30 minute longer version. I say kind of because I know how Zack works. I remember Watchmen being vastly improved with its director's cut, so in a way I was expecting BvS to perform in a similar manner, but I also feared those 30 minutes wold be just there to amplify action and discredit storytelling issues. Oh boy, I'm so glad I was proved wrong. The ultimate cut of the film was infuriating, but not because it was awful, but because it questions the sanity of WB executives and editors and makes you wonder what were they thinking during the editing process. What I got out of the Ultimate Edition was a thought-provoking deconstruction of two very iconic superheroes that gave spotlight to the struggles both of them face when they aren't fighting crime. What I got was an extremely well produced character study on both Batman and Superman in a cynical world, a world dangerously close to our own. We meet Batman as a ruthless, worn out hero that has seen the failure behind his ideals and witnessed some truly horrifying things in his life. Superman, on the other hand, is portrayed as a godlike figure that seeks to do good in the world, but finds himself emotionally conflicted once he realized that every good deed he does leaves behind a trail of destruction (most of it due to Luthor's antics). In my opinion, this is a hugely original approach, one that distances itself from the rest of the competition and delivers a dark, somber, yet relevant superhero movie that understands both characters and gives them real human struggles to deal with. I felt invested in both of them, and hoped that by the end of the film both could find a way to redeem themselves. Their character arcs were very well established during the first two acts of the movie, and by the time we get to the titular climactic battle the emotion behind the jaw-dropping action is intensified. Lex Luthor as a villain was also given more time to develop with this new edition. One of the main criticisms with the original version was the fact that his plan relied too much on conveniences, and the character's mannerisms and mad-scientist attitude was annoying, and that goes without saying his motivations were unclear. Not only do we spend more time understanding his hate for any godlike figure and thus his hatred for Superman, but the added scenes allowed us to witness his entire plan come to fruition. It sells the cold, manipulative, calculating attributes of his comic counterpart. The acting is spot on. Every actor owns his/her role, from Cavill's Superman, to Ben Affleck as Batman, Eisenberg as Luthor, and Gadot as Wonder Woman, whose scenes are brief, but are more than enough to sell the strong and ferocious warrior that she is. Cinematography is stunning, and miles above that of Man of Steel's. And the soundtrack by Zimmer and Junkie XL? Perfect, just perfect. When it comes to flaws, the film still has some of those. The Martha moment, while serving as a pivotal character moment for Batman, felt off in execution, and its understandable that many people got mad at it. If your main complaint about BvS the first time around was its bleak tone and subject matter, this film is still not for you. I understand most were expecting to see the heroes being the most iconic versions of themselves, clashing in an elongated battle and evoking the same feelings The Avengers gave audiences back in 2012. In that sense, the film will remain divisive, but at least I have the comfort of saying that, at the very least, the film is competently made."

"This film was amazing. Ben Affleck was easily the best part of this movie, he brought his a-game as Batman. The chemistry between Affleck & Irons was outstanding. Gal Gadot did a great job as Wonder Woman. The fight between Batman & Superman was awesome. The final fight with Doomsday was outstanding in every way possible. However, there is only one problem with this film and that's Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor. He was sadly missed cast in this role, but then again it's really the fault of Warner Bros. Studios. Overall, this film deliver on almost every level. I highly recommend that you watch the extended version of this film."

"I know I know. I saw it in theaters too, and felt like it could've been so much better. While the Batman element was good, the narrative felt fractured, and the third act was just one long stunt scene. Superman was relegated to a supporting character, and other characters didn't get a chance to shine. And then I chanced on the ultimate cut. Calling it 30 mins of \"extra\" footage is unfair to Zack Snyder because it's exactly these 30 mins that makes the movie a worthy one. What I can say about the theatrical cut is this - It had the blockbuster elements - music, visuals, stunts, CGI. But, it lacked the human elements. The first 20 mins of the movie had it, but not after that. The extended cut in comparison has a flow to the narrative. There are no disjointed scenes, everything flows smoothly, and there's connective tissue. Superman gets to spend some time with his father, and mother. Clark Kent does some investigative journalism. Superman helps the people after the blast. Lois Lane doesn't jump to conclusions, she gets to the bottom of the crime. Lex Luthor apparently had a coherent plan - everything is explained pretty well. Wonder Woman was already good, so there's no change there :) Also, the \"Martha\" scene seems better executed, because it is a few seconds longer, and there's time to breathe it in. So, here's my take on this movie - The theatrical cut was junk. Get the Bluray for ultimate edition, and you shall not be disappointed. I've seen it so many more times now, and it's the definitive cut. It is the movie we deserve. It's a unique take on Batman, and Superman. It's a gritty take on the superhero movie genre, and definitely the best DCEU movie, and the best DC movie since The Dark Knight.P.S. Yes it's dark. We're adults, and we should appreciate mature film making without intentionally silly moments. It attempts to be philosophical, and something deep instead of just trying to make you chuckle."

"This is one of the best superhero movies ever made. Zack Snyder is a magician behind the camera.The reason behind so many complaints is the fact that Warner Bros. marketed this movie as a fight between Batman and Superman. That's not what it is. It's a movie about the origins of the Justice League.The cinematography, the acting and the score are all second to none. This film is phenomenal.P.S: watch the 3 hour extended cut that Snyder intended you to see, not the 2 and a half hour movie that Warner Bros. decided would be better for theaters."

"I don't care what the critics say, this is a very well-done movie. I'll start my review by listing what I like about the movie.1.) Ben Affleck is the best batman to me and it is not close. He pulls off the role of an aging batman extremely well. Also, Zack Snyder's vision of batman is legit. I have always hated batman up until this adaptation of him. Instead of being a conflicted and idealistic batman, this batman is dark, gritty, and 100% a badass. His equipment is decked out with machine guns and he has no aversion to killing people. In fact, he probably kills about 50 criminal by the time this movie is over. The warehouse scene is the coolest batman scene in any movie.2.) The development of a grudge between batman and superman is pulled off flawlessly. It actually makes sense why batman dislikes superman. Then, when they do fight it is about the coolest thing you can expect to see from a superhero film. 3.) I disagree with a lot of people about Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor. In my opinion, he played his role to perfection. 4.) B v S sets up Wonder Woman and Justice League with Gal Gadot's cameo as Wonder Woman and short clips of Aquaman, the Flash, and Cyborg. B v S is one of my favorite superhero films and rewatching it never gets old."

"The theatrical cut of this film is garbage which is why I rated it eight stars instead of nine. The first time I watched this film I didn't like it (not straight out hate but didn't like). Character motivations didn't make any sense, Lex was annoying as s***, editing was sloppy, and it was overly dark and broody for an action superhero movie. A year + a half, five Marvel films, a ton of bad reviews and a Justice League later a thought popped into my head: \"what if I watched BVS again\". This time I didn't have trailers ruining the best moments, I only vaguely remembered the film, and I was conditioned to look at it negatively but something unexpected happened: I actually loved it. Superman was just a normal person that tried to make a difference cause he could that others imposed their own beliefs on. Lex Luthor was a genius that couldn't stand his powerlessness compared to Superman or more accurately a super being. As Alfred said \"The fever, the rage, the feeling of powerlessness that turns good men... cruel\" and you see the same thought process in Batman. Batman, just like Lex Luthor feels powerless in the midst of a god-being and just like Lex he attempts to destroy him so he can get his sense of power back but unlike Lex, Batman learns something. I what is one of the corniest lines of the movie Superman says, \"Martha\" when he knows he can't win against Batman in a late desperate attempt to save his mother. Not only does this name connect with Bruce Wayne but it also shows what really matters to a man of steel: it isn't power, it isn't fame or anything else, it is his Mother and on a broader scale it is people. Lex (who doesn't care about people at all) knows he doesn't have the power so he creates something from his blood and the remains of Zod: A Doomsday for Superman. Not only does this film have depth but it also doesn't always explain it to you which is rare in a blockbuster action superhero flick normally cater to semi-comic book fans and people that want to shove popcorn in their mouths. This film rewards you for really noticing the details while still having massive explosions. One of my favorites is how Lex has all of Batman's branded killed which is why he isn't afraid of the branding at the end or Grandma's Peach Tea as a way of scaring the s*** out of someone. Of course, this film isn't perfect and I do have personal dislikes. The Batman V Superman fight was slow and pretty boring especially after watching such an amazing fight in Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 2 (If you haven't watched the animated Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 1 and 2 you are sorely missing out on something fantastic). Also, the addition of Wonder Woman who pretty much steals a hacker thing, gives it back and then suits up and fights against a giant monster thing. Not to say I don't like Wonder Woman (She is one of my favorite Superheroes of all time who showed not only can woman kick a** but they also don't need to be ashamed of their sexuality or gender) but she wasn't really that helpful to the plot and just brought in to expand the universe which was well done through Lex's superhuman hunting files. Also, the post-apocalyptic scene that was just a dream could have been cut but nothing is perfect except movies like Citizen Kane which isn't a lot of fun to watch cause it is too perfect. So to summarize, the theatrical cut is bad, the ultimate cut is Amazing and the other cut is meh. Please give it a second chance because it deserves it and save a good director from losing grace because of something he didn't do."
"I really liked it, don't know what all the hate is about. I'm actually a Marvel fan from when I was 7 or so, but Superman and Batman together in 1 movie? Just great. And personally I like Ben Affleck even better than Christian Bale as Batman. So just watch and enjoy, I know I did!"

"That's right. We have been waiting for these two heroes to finally meet and fight against each other. This movie is so good in both plot and special effects.Henry Cavill and Ben Affleck have performed well in their acting stages. They are the best superhero actors and they have filmed their fighting scenes very well. The movie starts to show the conflict between the lives of the heroes and now they have blamed each other for it. This movie is amazing and sets up a good plot for Dawn Justice."

"Actually...I didn't know what to expect. When you see Wonder Woman, you know it will be off of Wonder Woman and off of a Wonder Woman story, but with Batman V Superman, I was like, \"hmmmm, so who is this about?\" It was pretty obvious that it would feature many characters, but I thought the introduction to Batman was amazing. Ben Affleck nailed the part, not only as Batman but also as Bruce Wayne. He is my Batman. Henry Cavill continued to be super as the Man of Steel. And he is my Super - Man. A dark story? Yes, without a doubt. Could it have had a few more jokes? Sure. But not all movies or stories need to have jokes when certain events are serious. I really hope people can see this review and take another look at the movie, because, I loved it. I really hope the ratings can go up, eventually. And P.S, this movie is the perfect set up to Justice League."

"I'll start by making it clear I have only ever seen the Ultimate Edition. I'm aware of what was cut out for the theatrical release, so I will concede up front that most of the criticisms about pacing, editing, and missing bits of plot at release were merited.With that caveat out of the way, I must reiterate that this was bar-none the boldest superhero movie I have ever seen. To me, it was arguably the best as well, though \"best\" shouldn't be taken to mean \"most enjoyable.\" That honor easily goes to \"Thor: Ragnarok.\" What makes BvS stand out among other films in the genre is that it takes two characters who have been done to death since the 1970s and brings them up to date. I recently tried to watch \"Superman: The Movie\" for the first time in a number of years, and while it was still good and Reeves will always be iconic, I just couldn't take it seriously. I'll put it this way: If the story in BvS was \"stupid\" in your view but Superman turning back time by spinning the earth backward on its axis didn't seem like one of the dumbest things you have ever seen -in any movie from any genre- to the extent that it outright ruins the movie for you, then your opinion about BvS isn't worth much. Nostalgic bias was always going to be a problem for this movie, and the way people reacted to and reviewed \"Man of Steel\" was telling in this regard.That brings me to Zack Snyder's take on Superman. You know, that guy whose status as the first extraterrestrial ever encountered by humanity was a total non-issue in the old movies. Apparently, Snyder has a similar view to my own in that his take on the Man of Steel makes his being an alien a core piece of his identity. He may look like any other (absurdly attractive) person, but he knows what he is, and that makes him perpetually uncertain of where he fits in this world. He is essentially good and really does care about people, but he struggles to truly empathize with the likes of us. To be human is to be frail, and that is not something he can easily relate to. This is the root of his conflict with Batman.Just as Clark struggles to genuinely relate to most people, Snyder's Batman either refuses to or otherwise just can't relate to Superman. He doesn't see him as anything but a threat regardless of Superman's clear good intentions. Remember, a small group of Kryptonians were able to bring humanity to the brink of extinction in less than a day, and Bruce Wayne is nothing if not a realist. He didn't know the guy from Kansas. He only knew the god from another world.While Batman's anger toward and fear of Superman are readily apparent from the start, Superman's inability to imagine things from Bruce Wayne's perspective only becomes truly apparent during their first real interaction. This reminded me of the animated version of the \"world's finest\" storyline, where Superman judges Batman harshly for using fear tactics and threats of violence (also, actual violence) to get the job done. Superman wasn't willing to consider what it would take for a human man to fight criminals and save innocents, or what that life would do to him over time. Just as Batman didn't see the guy from Kansas, Superman didn't see the man who lives his life trapped in one brutal, unthinkably traumatic moment (this was beautifully conveyed during the film's opening moments), and had spent his whole adult life bearing witness to humanity at its absolute worst.The conflict between these two characters is as old as human history. They want the same things, but they can't understand one another. So they fight. And what a fight it was.Watching a fight between, say, Captain America and Iron Man was, to me, more frustrating than anything because each understood the other's perspective perfectly. The fight between Batman and Superman in BvS was genuinely gut-wrenching, as intended, because they would have understood one another if either had tried. The whole sequence hilighted Batman's tactical prowess and ability to control a situation. Maybe the most badass thing about the fight was that it ended exactly where Batman planned. That brings me to the big elephant in the room named \"Martha.\"I can't recall exactly which YouTuber put it this way, but if you thought the \"save Martha\" exchange was about their mothers having the same name, you had your brain turned off. The brain-on people have explained this to death, but it bears repeating. This was the moment when Superman became humanized to Batman. He was about to die, and his only concern was for his adoptive human mother. He still believed that the man about to take his life would do the right thing. Even with the cowl on, there was no mistaking the look on Batman's face. It was the look of shame, guilt, and sudden uncertainty that says \"What am I doing?\" Turns out even the most brutal, angry version of Bruce Wayne is better than Tony Stark at knowing right from wrong. At knowing that he had gone too far.From there, the third act was a series of truly impressive (albeit mostly CGI) fight sequences, beginning with what I regard as the undisputed champion of Batman fights. Nothing in the Nolan movies (and especially nothing in the Burton movies) even came close. Go ahead, try to convince yourself that Batman and Bane taking turns punching one another in the face until Bane's mask broke was a good fight sequence. No, this was a fight straight out of \"Arkham Knight,\" and it was glorious. The battle against Doomsday really was one for the books. From the moment Wonder Woman arrived accompanied by the intense sounds of Tina Guo's electric cello to Superman's tragic, heroic death at the hands of Doomsday, I was glued to the screen. Sure, the mere presence of Doomsday spoiled the end to a degree, but watching the Man of Steel laboring to carry that kryptonite spear towards certain death was no less impactful. A brief word on Jesse Eisenberg's take on Lex Luthor. At least one other reviewer on this site already said it best when they pointed out that this was his origin story. If you consider his scheme objectively, he is actually one of the more formidable incarnations of the character. If we're lucky, we'll eventually get to see a Snyder Cut of \"Justice League\" and find out where this story was actually meant to go. For the record, Joss Whedon and Danny Elfman both should have said \"no\" to taking a dump on someone else's art."
"BATMAN V SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE brings a fantastic surprise to a smash-hit team-up with one of the worlds most beloved DC Comics' icons of all time. The movie delivers spectacular casting, and fantastic acting with different characters having their shine in each scenes.The story follows Clark Kent/Superman who becomes a threat, after the destruction in Metropolis in Man Of Steel.(2013). Batman/Bruce Wayne sees him as a threat and begins his war on Superman.The movie brings spectacular storytelling, it tells the complications of human against alien who are on the same side, and the first meeting of Batman and Superman. The story of Bruce Wayne, with his many years of The Caped Crusader, sends him on a spiral of \"out of control\", sheer anger, and builds tension to wanting to defeat the Man of Steel. Snyder has fantastically gave this storytelling an exciting nod to the comics.Lex Luthor, played by Jesse Einsberg, delivers a very interesting performance, but very differently by him showing is his \"origin\" before he becomes a bald foe to the Man of Steel. He shows that his love of \"god vs man\" terrorises mankind when he ultimately creates Doomsday, and Batman realises Superman's inner heroism.It packs so many great \"out of nowhere\" excitement, including a first-look of the fearful Wonder Woman a.k.a. Diana Prince, played by Gal Gadot, and a fresh-new glimpse of the superhero DC canon: The Justice League.WATCH THIS MOVIE! The critics are out of their mind. It's a fun-packed action adventure which still keeps the movie enjoyable until it's final minutes of the movie. It's a FANTASTIC MOVIE! BEN AFFLECK AS BATMAN... is Incredible!A 10/10 overall!"
"I want to go on record as saying that this is a truly thrilling cinematic experience in so many ways. If pressed, I guess I could acknowledge that there were a couple ... let's say \"clumsy\" moments. And in a film that runs to three hours, that hardly seems like a significant issue, certainly not enough to rate it with fewer than 9 stars.This film has everything. There is dramatic tension right from the start. There is a magnificent story arc that picks up quite seamlessly from 'Man of Steel' and propels the viewer not only into the life of Clark Kent/Superman but also of Bruce Wayne/Batman.The villain is no mere cartoon of a villain; he is truly thoroughly (and apparently irrevocably) diabolical. He is a psychopath, and you wish for his death over and over and over. You want Superman to reduce him to ash with the power of his eyes.I have read a number of viewers' reviews, and it seems that the people who disliked the film / gave it a low rating had rather unfair and unrealistic expectations of it. That is, their own prejudices about how the plot could/should unfold or what the character development could/should be, etc. ruined the film for them. And that is a shame.My thought is: I settle into my seat, wait for the lights to dim, and then I wait to be transported by the film. I accept it, lock, stock, and barrel.As another reviewer remarked, I love how the film begins from the point of view of Bruce Wayne as he is among people on the ground who have fallen victim to the attack of Zod and the other Kryptonians.Why would Bruce Wayne not like Superman? Why would the good people of Earth hurl insults at Superman and burn him in effigy (on the news)? Because the good people of Earth just got catapulted into a new reality in which there are not only extraterrestrial beings (surprise!) but they are also superman! And a group of them are hell-bent on destroying humankind and taking the planet for themselves.It is difficult to see Superman as separate from the whole Kryptonian Krew.It seems that many moviegoers forgot that Bruce Wayne is also human. Sure, he's a hero, but he is flawed.. Just like the rest of us. He is a vigilante, after all.He has let his vigilantism get the better of him. HE is actually the one working outside the boundaries of the law, not Superman. It is the clear head of Alfred that shows us that he has gone into a rather dark place, that he has not seen what is really going on (in Luthor's scheme), and so he chooses to embark on his own scheme scheme to take out the alien invader. He is (allegedly) thinking of the future: if he wipes out the all-powerful alien, then it can't turn on humankind in the future. At least, he convinces himself of that.A philosophical question is raised in the film: should Clark Kent have remained a simple man from Kansas and never have become the Superman? Should he just let people die and let calamities happen? The question is answered for us in the character of Diana Prince/Wonder Woman. She withdrew from mankind (her exact words) and just sat around watching. Watching while people died horrible deaths all around her. So, should Superman have done the same? Do these special beings, these 'metahumans', have some kind of moral imperative to intervene, or should they be allowed to be regular people, too? It seems that humans want it both ways.It seems that humans are saying: \"Don't be a superalien ... except when I and my friends and family are in trouble. Then come save us.\""

"Batman v Superman: Ultimate Edition: If your looking for a quick, cheap thrill then you might not enjoy this film at the time. This movies theatrical version was butchered by WB and in doing so reshaped the story leaving numerous plot holes. So the Ultimate Edition is the full story and the one worth seeing. Watch 'Man of Steel' before seeing this movie. There is much to claw through here, so much so that the audience might easily find themselves exhausted from the overall aggression of the film. However, a lot of the story does work. The action is good, and the emotion feels real most of the time.This film is about Superman trying to become Superman. Trying to help the world, save people, find a place in this world not as an outcast, and yet is looked at has a threat by many. Superman is not from this world, yet He is trying to be human, find a place in this world, be excepted by earths people, and come into his destiny.This film is also about Batman being Batman for 20 years and losing faith in humanity, and fearing Superman, what Superman can do with his powers. Great film, great plot, great visuals. ---Yidioo"
"I didn't see the film in the theaters and just bought the \"Extended Edition \" on Amazon. I never properly saw Man of Steel- i think I rented it and watched it when already exhausted and fell asleep. I saw the mediocre user reviews and horrible reviews from critics of this film.They really have it wrong. This is the very best either Batman or Superman. It has a different take, on things. Much darker then earlier films even darker then the Christopher Nolan Batman films.First of all Christopher Nolan is an Executive Producer. So how bad could it be? I loved Sucker Punch and Zack Snyder was involved with that. So how bad could this be? Hans Zimmer did the music, so how bad could it be?I remember watching the old Superman TV shows and reading the Superman and Batman comics as a little kid and loved them, but i wouldn't call myself a \"fan boy\" of comic universes, like so many younger people today. As an older adult I will admit my favorite TV show of all time was Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but watched it on DVD only after it had finished. I saw the second of the Dark Knight series in the theater, but the other two, I watched on DVD. They were great, but not my favorite films like so many people. i also loved the first couple Superman and Batman films in the older series. Regardless, i was not waiting with baited breath to see Man of Steel or this one.I'm more of a serious film fan, who can watch Stanley Kubrick films over and over and my favorite films in the last twenty years, are Eyes Wide Shut and Intersteller, both of which i've watched multiple times.So, with that said, take it from me, the critics have this film very wrong, just as critics hated 2001: A Space Odyssey when it first came out. This film will have lasting appreciation.Surprised how much I liked Ben Afleck's Batman. it was hard to get into Henry Cavil's scrawnier looking Superman, but it grew on me. Amy Adams was great as Lois Lane, The Gal Gadol Wonder Women was amazing. Lex Luther was terrific, like Nolan's Joker. Jeremy Irons was the best Alfred ever. Holly Hunter and Diane Lane was good too. The movie had bad reviews but made a billion dollars. Hopefully everyone buys the Ultimate Edition and it breaks sales records and the film is re-appreciated. I have no idea what scenes this Ultimate Edition added, but it is pretty perfect. Now I can't wait for Wonder Woman and the Justice League and as soon as I finish writing this am going to watch Man of Steal. I'm into it now!I can only surmise that the bad reviews stem from too much expectations of the rigid fan boy types and the radical changes in tone, we see in this film.Total masterpiece of cinema, but I have a few criticisms. There are a few hollow scenes of typical Idiot cops and authorities getting everything wrong in a cliché type way and it has a few filler scenes of that type and a few moments here and there that felt rushed and cheesy. Maybe not everything restored into the Ultimate Edition should have been. I wish there had been more Kevin Costner scenes."

"The whole entire Batman V Superman movie was great and yes even though it felt slow to the majority of the people who watched it but to me I enjoyed every part and every scene of Batman V Superman and when it got to the fight scenes both batman VS Superman and the Doomsday fight it brought so much drama, intensity, and epic performances. So with that being said I give this movie a good 10/10 because it really did go to my expectations and it brought a powerful performance and a powerful yet epic introduction to the upcoming Justice League."

"When I first wrote a review for this movie a year ago exclaiming my excitement for the film, I had been high off a fresh dose of live-action DC superheroes playing out the beloved comic book stories that I had grown up on. It was all playing out before my eyes and coming to life. After a few months had passed, I began to notice things about the movie that I disliked: little gaps in the story, things that didn't add up, etc. My original rating of a 10 / 10 dropped to an 8 /10. But today it has gone back up to a 10. The extended version of the film not only rectifies the gaps but also silences critics.Many claimed that the movie was too dark or that it just didn't make sense. To those people, I say: \"Pick up a comic book!\" Many of the critics of this particular film were part of the superhero bandwagon that formed when Marvel began its spree of Avengers-related films. In fact, its estimated that over 60% of people who go to see 'superhero' genre films have never picked up a comic book in their life. I would argue that similar numbers could figure to those which view the CW televised DC Universe shows. People complain that DC comics is just too dark but the fact is that these movies are based upon actual comics which are meant to be dark (ex: The Dark Knight Returns, Injustice, etc.). Its like complaining that Game of Thrones (the TV series) sucks because they kill off too many characters. Read the books! Its frustrating to see such a beautiful work of art like Batman V Superman criticized by those ignorant to its universe and its meaning. This movie is in fact a catalyst that opens numerous doorways and leaves true fans in awe of the possibilities for future movies. But regardless of whether or not people choose to educate themselves, this film's DVD/Blu-ray extended version puts the theater release to shame. All of the plot holes and gaps are filled in 30 minutes of extended footage scattered throughout the film. The movie ultimately becomes more complete and people will wish that the movie had shown the full 3 hours of footage in its theatrical debut. As a major DC comics fan, I will of course pick up on things that a comics fan would not, but someone who does not read comics would learn to appreciate this film in its entirety with the extended version. Get your hands on a copy today or find it on Netflix or the internet somewhere!"

"I ignored the bad reviews and watched anyways. This film had a lot to live up to after Civil War was released and I went into this film expecting the worst. It ended up to be the best Superhero film of 2016 to me. One complaint was that this film was more concerned about universe building than telling a great story than Civil War but for me it was the other way around; Civil War felt like a build up to something else and to be honest, I felt that way when I saw the other MCU films. Batman vs Superman however not only had a great story, but it also felt a lot more consistent than Civil War. This film was way more diverse with the cast than the MCU but unlike the MCU, I felt like this film doesn't go overboard with the SJW stuff like the MCU films or The Star Wars Sequel films do. The Visuals were AMAZING, The Score by Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL was AMAZING as well, The Tone is just right as I actually felt for the characters emotionally, The Cinematography kept my eyes glued to the screen, and the script felt really Intelligent and Complex and despite people calling the writing confusing, I was able to piece it together with no problem whatsoever. This film is similar to Empire Strikes back in terms of popularity so over time after the other movies are released, this movie would probably be more popular.This film was way better than I Expected and deserves another chance.

"Its shame to see what critics and marvel fans did to this movie and targeted Zack Snyder for it. I have seen this movie more than 25 times till date. And i enjoy this movie as much as i enjoyed the first time. The fans who have read DC comics, wouldn't be disappointed in this movie. Its dark movie, yes it is. Because the title shows the intense situation at hand. Two superheroes about to rip each other apart for whatever reasons that brought them to this stage. Yes it had to be dark and intense.Only marvel can be stupid enough to show an alien invasion where humans are loosing the battle and the super heroes are cracking jokes while battles as if they are playing ping pong. a person playing Call of Duty game is more serious while playing than the marvel heroes fighting aliens."

"Last week some news came out from somebody online who had claimed to have seen a finished version of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. If you were like me, you've been leery of checking it out because you weren't sure how much might actually be true. Now Zack Snyder has spoken out about the spoiler-filled post, although his response doesn't really clear anything up.In a word, to MTV, he called the post \"hilarious,which might imply that he's saying that it's mostly, if not entirely, untrue. That might be the case, but then again he could have just said it was untrue and he didn't say that. What he did say, however, is that he doesn't like spoilers. While this may seem odd for the director who's most recent trailer appeared to give away the entire movie, Snyder says that's not the case. Even if you've seen the trailer, you can rest easy, as there is much more we have not seen in then finished film. Says Snyder I have the benefit of seeing the movie. It's cool that think it's too much, and I appreciate people not wanting to know, but there's plenty that they don't know. There's a lot of movie that's not in the trailer. In the process of calling the Batman v Superman Reddit review hilarious, Snyder goes on to talk about how he hates it when spoilers come out. The director would much rather that fans see the movie mostly blind. While he understands that some fans may wish to find the answers before hand, he wants his movies to be mysteries going in. If you're, as an audience member, exploring these articles, looking for answers to questions that you have, maybe you're okay with knowing before you go. It's like an individual taste. But like I said, I want people to see the movie without knowing.Spoilers are a topic that mean different things to different people. While most try to avoid them to some degree, the need to solve the mystery is a nearly universal human experience. We have an inclination to want to know the truth, even while also wanting to be surprised. For most of us getting some information is good, but getting all the information is bad, of course, only getting the details that you want can be difficult."
"The theatrical is choppy, poorly edited, hard to follow, with some really good moments mixed in their. The extended is much more fluent and is much easier to follow, it does have a long runtime, which might make it seem a bit dragging on, but if you like long films done right, like Lord of the Rings, you will like this movie as long as you get into the characters and story. Speaking of which, the story starts out perfectly showing Bruce Wayne as a character, and it is very powerful. There are several moments in this movie that are powerful, emotional, and shocking. Characters. Batman is my favorite fictional character of all time, and believe me when I say, Ben Affleck as Batman was perfect, he had the charisma, the anger, and the look of being through some bad stuff Gal Gadot also does perfect as Wonder Woman, but if you want to really see how good she does, go watch the Wonder Woman movie. Henry Call as Superman. I really don't like it when people say Christopher Reeves is better. Don't get me wrong, Reeves does great, but can you imagine him as Superman in this movie? I wouldn't like it. It would be like Adam West playing Batman in The Dark Knight. Henry Cavill does great in this role, I can say everything about him as I said with Ben Affleck. Jesse Eisenberg as Luthor. I thought it was different in a good way. I've heard a criticism for him as being too much like Joker, but is that a bad thing? Joker is my favorite villain, so to see Superman have an enemy that crazy, but still hold the values Luthor needs to be Luthor, I think it is great. The thing I thought this movie was lacking in the first and second acts was humor, at least good humor. If there was more humor, I would've given this movie a ten because it would give a more relaxing feel to the parts that needed it. All in all though, this movie was awesome, it had powerful moments, it was badass, and just plain fun. It had a great story arc and does its job very well."

"*I will be talking about the Ultimate Edition of the film* This was one of the most anticipated CBM of all time. Ever since the arrival and subsequent success of Marvel's The Avengers people have wondered when will DC launch its own cinematic universe, one of the main reasons being the opportunity to finally see titans such as Batman and Superman share the screen together: the ultimate nerd dream. On 2016, the moment finally came for BvS to be released AND.. it performed poorly. Not only did critical reception left a lot to be desired, but fan reactions where surprisingly split after its cinematic debut. People either loved it and called Zack a genius, or hated it and called him a hack. Me, personally, I found myself with middle of the road feelings, for sure, but more leaning towards the negative side with subsequent viewings. The theatrical cut of the film showcased amazing performances, incredible visuals, and action set pieces that seemed like comic book panels come to life, in a good way. However, when it comes to its narrative structure and more technical aspects like editing, the film was seriously flawed. More plot holes than Age of Ultron, questionable character decisions, random editing that lacked cohesion and focus, and forced dramatic moments that lacked any impact because the attempts at character development ranged from limited to nonexistent, especially when it comes to Superman's character. I thought it was a 5/10 movie at best. As such, I was kind of skeptical about the idea of a 30 minute longer version. I say kind of because I know how Zack works. I remember Watchmen being vastly improved with its director's cut, so in a way I was expecting BvS to perform in a similar manner, but I also feared those 30 minutes wold be just there to amplify action and discredit storytelling issues. Oh boy, I'm so glad I was proved wrong. The ultimate cut of the film was infuriating, but not because it was awful, but because it questions the sanity of WB executives and editors and makes you wonder what were they thinking during the editing process. What I got out of the Ultimate Edition was a thought-provoking deconstruction of two very iconic superheroes that gave spotlight to the struggles both of them face when they aren't fighting crime. What I got was an extremely well produced character study on both Batman and Superman in a cynical world, a world dangerously close to our own. We meet Batman as a ruthless, worn out hero that has seen the failure behind his ideals and witnessed some truly horrifying things in his life. Superman, on the other hand, is portrayed as a godlike figure that seeks to do good in the world, but finds himself emotionally conflicted once he realized that every good deed he does leaves behind a trail of destruction (most of it due to Luthor's antics). In my opinion, this is a hugely original approach, one that distances itself from the rest of the competition and delivers a dark, somber, yet relevant superhero movie that understands both characters and gives them real human struggles to deal with. I felt invested in both of them, and hoped that by the end of the film both could find a way to redeem themselves. Their character arcs were very well established during the first two acts of the movie, and by the time we get to the titular climactic battle the emotion behind the jaw-dropping action is intensified. Lex Luthor as a villain was also given more time to develop with this new edition. One of the main criticisms with the original version was the fact that his plan relied too much on conveniences, and the character's mannerisms and mad-scientist attitude was annoying, and that goes without saying his motivations were unclear. Not only do we spend more time understanding his hate for any godlike figure and thus his hatred for Superman, but the added scenes allowed us to witness his entire plan come to fruition. It sells the cold, manipulative, calculating attributes of his comic counterpart. The acting is spot on. Every actor owns his/her role, from Cavill's Superman, to Ben Affleck as Batman, Eisenberg as Luthor, and Gadot as Wonder Woman, whose scenes are brief, but are more than enough to sell the strong and ferocious warrior that she is. Cinematography is stunning, and miles above that of Man of Steel's. And the soundtrack by Zimmer and Junkie XL? Perfect, just perfect. When it comes to flaws, the film still has some of those. The Martha moment, while serving as a pivotal character moment for Batman, felt off in execution, and its understandable that many people got mad at it. If your main complaint about BvS the first time around was its bleak tone and subject matter, this film is still not for you. I understand most were expecting to see the heroes being the most iconic versions of themselves, clashing in an elongated battle and evoking the same feelings The Avengers gave audiences back in 2012. In that sense, the film will remain divisive, but at least I have the comfort of saying that, at the very least, the film is competently made."

"This film was amazing. Ben Affleck was easily the best part of this movie, he brought his a-game as Batman. The chemistry between Affleck & Irons was outstanding. Gal Gadot did a great job as Wonder Woman. The fight between Batman & Superman was awesome. The final fight with Doomsday was outstanding in every way possible. However, there is only one problem with this film and that's Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor. He was sadly missed cast in this role, but then again it's really the fault of Warner Bros. Studios. Overall, this film deliver on almost every level. I highly recommend that you watch the extended version of this film."

"I know I know. I saw it in theaters too, and felt like it could've been so much better. While the Batman element was good, the narrative felt fractured, and the third act was just one long stunt scene. Superman was relegated to a supporting character, and other characters didn't get a chance to shine. And then I chanced on the ultimate cut. Calling it 30 mins of \"extra\" footage is unfair to Zack Snyder because it's exactly these 30 mins that makes the movie a worthy one. What I can say about the theatrical cut is this - It had the blockbuster elements - music, visuals, stunts, CGI. But, it lacked the human elements. The first 20 mins of the movie had it, but not after that. The extended cut in comparison has a flow to the narrative. There are no disjointed scenes, everything flows smoothly, and there's connective tissue. Superman gets to spend some time with his father, and mother. Clark Kent does some investigative journalism. Superman helps the people after the blast. Lois Lane doesn't jump to conclusions, she gets to the bottom of the crime. Lex Luthor apparently had a coherent plan - everything is explained pretty well. Wonder Woman was already good, so there's no change there :) Also, the \"Martha\" scene seems better executed, because it is a few seconds longer, and there's time to breathe it in. So, here's my take on this movie - The theatrical cut was junk. Get the Bluray for ultimate edition, and you shall not be disappointed. I've seen it so many more times now, and it's the definitive cut. It is the movie we deserve. It's a unique take on Batman, and Superman. It's a gritty take on the superhero movie genre, and definitely the best DCEU movie, and the best DC movie since The Dark Knight.P.S. Yes it's dark. We're adults, and we should appreciate mature film making without intentionally silly moments. It attempts to be philosophical, and something deep instead of just trying to make you chuckle."

"This is one of the best superhero movies ever made. Zack Snyder is a magician behind the camera.The reason behind so many complaints is the fact that Warner Bros. marketed this movie as a fight between Batman and Superman. That's not what it is. It's a movie about the origins of the Justice League.The cinematography, the acting and the score are all second to none. This film is phenomenal.P.S: watch the 3 hour extended cut that Snyder intended you to see, not the 2 and a half hour movie that Warner Bros. decided would be better for theaters."

"I don't care what the critics say, this is a very well-done movie. I'll start my review by listing what I like about the movie.1.) Ben Affleck is the best batman to me and it is not close. He pulls off the role of an aging batman extremely well. Also, Zack Snyder's vision of batman is legit. I have always hated batman up until this adaptation of him. Instead of being a conflicted and idealistic batman, this batman is dark, gritty, and 100% a badass. His equipment is decked out with machine guns and he has no aversion to killing people. In fact, he probably kills about 50 criminal by the time this movie is over. The warehouse scene is the coolest batman scene in any movie.2.) The development of a grudge between batman and superman is pulled off flawlessly. It actually makes sense why batman dislikes superman. Then, when they do fight it is about the coolest thing you can expect to see from a superhero film. 3.) I disagree with a lot of people about Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor. In my opinion, he played his role to perfection. 4.) B v S sets up Wonder Woman and Justice League with Gal Gadot's cameo as Wonder Woman and short clips of Aquaman, the Flash, and Cyborg. B v S is one of my favorite superhero films and rewatching it never gets old."

"The theatrical cut of this film is garbage which is why I rated it eight stars instead of nine. The first time I watched this film I didn't like it (not straight out hate but didn't like). Character motivations didn't make any sense, Lex was annoying as s***, editing was sloppy, and it was overly dark and broody for an action superhero movie. A year + a half, five Marvel films, a ton of bad reviews and a Justice League later a thought popped into my head: \"what if I watched BVS again\". This time I didn't have trailers ruining the best moments, I only vaguely remembered the film, and I was conditioned to look at it negatively but something unexpected happened: I actually loved it. Superman was just a normal person that tried to make a difference cause he could that others imposed their own beliefs on. Lex Luthor was a genius that couldn't stand his powerlessness compared to Superman or more accurately a super being. As Alfred said \"The fever, the rage, the feeling of powerlessness that turns good men... cruel\" and you see the same thought process in Batman. Batman, just like Lex Luthor feels powerless in the midst of a god-being and just like Lex he attempts to destroy him so he can get his sense of power back but unlike Lex, Batman learns something. I what is one of the corniest lines of the movie Superman says, \"Martha\" when he knows he can't win against Batman in a late desperate attempt to save his mother. Not only does this name connect with Bruce Wayne but it also shows what really matters to a man of steel: it isn't power, it isn't fame or anything else, it is his Mother and on a broader scale it is people. Lex (who doesn't care about people at all) knows he doesn't have the power so he creates something from his blood and the remains of Zod: A Doomsday for Superman. Not only does this film have depth but it also doesn't always explain it to you which is rare in a blockbuster action superhero flick normally cater to semi-comic book fans and people that want to shove popcorn in their mouths. This film rewards you for really noticing the details while still having massive explosions. One of my favorites is how Lex has all of Batman's branded killed which is why he isn't afraid of the branding at the end or Grandma's Peach Tea as a way of scaring the s*** out of someone. Of course, this film isn't perfect and I do have personal dislikes. The Batman V Superman fight was slow and pretty boring especially after watching such an amazing fight in Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 2 (If you haven't watched the animated Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 1 and 2 you are sorely missing out on something fantastic). Also, the addition of Wonder Woman who pretty much steals a hacker thing, gives it back and then suits up and fights against a giant monster thing. Not to say I don't like Wonder Woman (She is one of my favorite Superheroes of all time who showed not only can woman kick a** but they also don't need to be ashamed of their sexuality or gender) but she wasn't really that helpful to the plot and just brought in to expand the universe which was well done through Lex's superhuman hunting files. Also, the post-apocalyptic scene that was just a dream could have been cut but nothing is perfect except movies like Citizen Kane which isn't a lot of fun to watch cause it is too perfect. So to summarize, the theatrical cut is bad, the ultimate cut is Amazing and the other cut is meh. Please give it a second chance because it deserves it and save a good director from losing grace because of something he didn't do."
"I really liked it, don't know what all the hate is about. I'm actually a Marvel fan from when I was 7 or so, but Superman and Batman together in 1 movie? Just great. And personally I like Ben Affleck even better than Christian Bale as Batman. So just watch and enjoy, I know I did!"

"That's right. We have been waiting for these two heroes to finally meet and fight against each other. This movie is so good in both plot and special effects.Henry Cavill and Ben Affleck have performed well in their acting stages. They are the best superhero actors and they have filmed their fighting scenes very well. The movie starts to show the conflict between the lives of the heroes and now they have blamed each other for it. This movie is amazing and sets up a good plot for Dawn Justice."

"Actually...I didn't know what to expect. When you see Wonder Woman, you know it will be off of Wonder Woman and off of a Wonder Woman story, but with Batman V Superman, I was like, \"hmmmm, so who is this about?\" It was pretty obvious that it would feature many characters, but I thought the introduction to Batman was amazing. Ben Affleck nailed the part, not only as Batman but also as Bruce Wayne. He is my Batman. Henry Cavill continued to be super as the Man of Steel. And he is my Super - Man. A dark story? Yes, without a doubt. Could it have had a few more jokes? Sure. But not all movies or stories need to have jokes when certain events are serious. I really hope people can see this review and take another look at the movie, because, I loved it. I really hope the ratings can go up, eventually. And P.S, this movie is the perfect set up to Justice League."

"I'll start by making it clear I have only ever seen the Ultimate Edition. I'm aware of what was cut out for the theatrical release, so I will concede up front that most of the criticisms about pacing, editing, and missing bits of plot at release were merited.With that caveat out of the way, I must reiterate that this was bar-none the boldest superhero movie I have ever seen. To me, it was arguably the best as well, though \"best\" shouldn't be taken to mean \"most enjoyable.\" That honor easily goes to \"Thor: Ragnarok.\" What makes BvS stand out among other films in the genre is that it takes two characters who have been done to death since the 1970s and brings them up to date. I recently tried to watch \"Superman: The Movie\" for the first time in a number of years, and while it was still good and Reeves will always be iconic, I just couldn't take it seriously. I'll put it this way: If the story in BvS was \"stupid\" in your view but Superman turning back time by spinning the earth backward on its axis didn't seem like one of the dumbest things you have ever seen -in any movie from any genre- to the extent that it outright ruins the movie for you, then your opinion about BvS isn't worth much. Nostalgic bias was always going to be a problem for this movie, and the way people reacted to and reviewed \"Man of Steel\" was telling in this regard.That brings me to Zack Snyder's take on Superman. You know, that guy whose status as the first extraterrestrial ever encountered by humanity was a total non-issue in the old movies. Apparently, Snyder has a similar view to my own in that his take on the Man of Steel makes his being an alien a core piece of his identity. He may look like any other (absurdly attractive) person, but he knows what he is, and that makes him perpetually uncertain of where he fits in this world. He is essentially good and really does care about people, but he struggles to truly empathize with the likes of us. To be human is to be frail, and that is not something he can easily relate to. This is the root of his conflict with Batman.Just as Clark struggles to genuinely relate to most people, Snyder's Batman either refuses to or otherwise just can't relate to Superman. He doesn't see him as anything but a threat regardless of Superman's clear good intentions. Remember, a small group of Kryptonians were able to bring humanity to the brink of extinction in less than a day, and Bruce Wayne is nothing if not a realist. He didn't know the guy from Kansas. He only knew the god from another world.While Batman's anger toward and fear of Superman are readily apparent from the start, Superman's inability to imagine things from Bruce Wayne's perspective only becomes truly apparent during their first real interaction. This reminded me of the animated version of the \"world's finest\" storyline, where Superman judges Batman harshly for using fear tactics and threats of violence (also, actual violence) to get the job done. Superman wasn't willing to consider what it would take for a human man to fight criminals and save innocents, or what that life would do to him over time. Just as Batman didn't see the guy from Kansas, Superman didn't see the man who lives his life trapped in one brutal, unthinkably traumatic moment (this was beautifully conveyed during the film's opening moments), and had spent his whole adult life bearing witness to humanity at its absolute worst.The conflict between these two characters is as old as human history. They want the same things, but they can't understand one another. So they fight. And what a fight it was.Watching a fight between, say, Captain America and Iron Man was, to me, more frustrating than anything because each understood the other's perspective perfectly. The fight between Batman and Superman in BvS was genuinely gut-wrenching, as intended, because they would have understood one another if either had tried. The whole sequence hilighted Batman's tactical prowess and ability to control a situation. Maybe the most badass thing about the fight was that it ended exactly where Batman planned. That brings me to the big elephant in the room named \"Martha.\"I can't recall exactly which YouTuber put it this way, but if you thought the \"save Martha\" exchange was about their mothers having the same name, you had your brain turned off. The brain-on people have explained this to death, but it bears repeating. This was the moment when Superman became humanized to Batman. He was about to die, and his only concern was for his adoptive human mother. He still believed that the man about to take his life would do the right thing. Even with the cowl on, there was no mistaking the look on Batman's face. It was the look of shame, guilt, and sudden uncertainty that says \"What am I doing?\" Turns out even the most brutal, angry version of Bruce Wayne is better than Tony Stark at knowing right from wrong. At knowing that he had gone too far.From there, the third act was a series of truly impressive (albeit mostly CGI) fight sequences, beginning with what I regard as the undisputed champion of Batman fights. Nothing in the Nolan movies (and especially nothing in the Burton movies) even came close. Go ahead, try to convince yourself that Batman and Bane taking turns punching one another in the face until Bane's mask broke was a good fight sequence. No, this was a fight straight out of \"Arkham Knight,\" and it was glorious. The battle against Doomsday really was one for the books. From the moment Wonder Woman arrived accompanied by the intense sounds of Tina Guo's electric cello to Superman's tragic, heroic death at the hands of Doomsday, I was glued to the screen. Sure, the mere presence of Doomsday spoiled the end to a degree, but watching the Man of Steel laboring to carry that kryptonite spear towards certain death was no less impactful. A brief word on Jesse Eisenberg's take on Lex Luthor. At least one other reviewer on this site already said it best when they pointed out that this was his origin story. If you consider his scheme objectively, he is actually one of the more formidable incarnations of the character. If we're lucky, we'll eventually get to see a Snyder Cut of \"Justice League\" and find out where this story was actually meant to go. For the record, Joss Whedon and Danny Elfman both should have said \"no\" to taking a dump on someone else's art."
"BATMAN V SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE brings a fantastic surprise to a smash-hit team-up with one of the worlds most beloved DC Comics' icons of all time. The movie delivers spectacular casting, and fantastic acting with different characters having their shine in each scenes.The story follows Clark Kent/Superman who becomes a threat, after the destruction in Metropolis in Man Of Steel.(2013). Batman/Bruce Wayne sees him as a threat and begins his war on Superman.The movie brings spectacular storytelling, it tells the complications of human against alien who are on the same side, and the first meeting of Batman and Superman. The story of Bruce Wayne, with his many years of The Caped Crusader, sends him on a spiral of \"out of control\", sheer anger, and builds tension to wanting to defeat the Man of Steel. Snyder has fantastically gave this storytelling an exciting nod to the comics.Lex Luthor, played by Jesse Einsberg, delivers a very interesting performance, but very differently by him showing is his \"origin\" before he becomes a bald foe to the Man of Steel. He shows that his love of \"god vs man\" terrorises mankind when he ultimately creates Doomsday, and Batman realises Superman's inner heroism.It packs so many great \"out of nowhere\" excitement, including a first-look of the fearful Wonder Woman a.k.a. Diana Prince, played by Gal Gadot, and a fresh-new glimpse of the superhero DC canon: The Justice League.WATCH THIS MOVIE! The critics are out of their mind. It's a fun-packed action adventure which still keeps the movie enjoyable until it's final minutes of the movie. It's a FANTASTIC MOVIE! BEN AFFLECK AS BATMAN... is Incredible!A 10/10 overall!"
"I want to go on record as saying that this is a truly thrilling cinematic experience in so many ways. If pressed, I guess I could acknowledge that there were a couple ... let's say \"clumsy\" moments. And in a film that runs to three hours, that hardly seems like a significant issue, certainly not enough to rate it with fewer than 9 stars.This film has everything. There is dramatic tension right from the start. There is a magnificent story arc that picks up quite seamlessly from 'Man of Steel' and propels the viewer not only into the life of Clark Kent/Superman but also of Bruce Wayne/Batman.The villain is no mere cartoon of a villain; he is truly thoroughly (and apparently irrevocably) diabolical. He is a psychopath, and you wish for his death over and over and over. You want Superman to reduce him to ash with the power of his eyes.I have read a number of viewers' reviews, and it seems that the people who disliked the film / gave it a low rating had rather unfair and unrealistic expectations of it. That is, their own prejudices about how the plot could/should unfold or what the character development could/should be, etc. ruined the film for them. And that is a shame.My thought is: I settle into my seat, wait for the lights to dim, and then I wait to be transported by the film. I accept it, lock, stock, and barrel.As another reviewer remarked, I love how the film begins from the point of view of Bruce Wayne as he is among people on the ground who have fallen victim to the attack of Zod and the other Kryptonians.Why would Bruce Wayne not like Superman? Why would the good people of Earth hurl insults at Superman and burn him in effigy (on the news)? Because the good people of Earth just got catapulted into a new reality in which there are not only extraterrestrial beings (surprise!) but they are also superman! And a group of them are hell-bent on destroying humankind and taking the planet for themselves.It is difficult to see Superman as separate from the whole Kryptonian Krew.It seems that many moviegoers forgot that Bruce Wayne is also human. Sure, he's a hero, but he is flawed.. Just like the rest of us. He is a vigilante, after all.He has let his vigilantism get the better of him. HE is actually the one working outside the boundaries of the law, not Superman. It is the clear head of Alfred that shows us that he has gone into a rather dark place, that he has not seen what is really going on (in Luthor's scheme), and so he chooses to embark on his own scheme scheme to take out the alien invader. He is (allegedly) thinking of the future: if he wipes out the all-powerful alien, then it can't turn on humankind in the future. At least, he convinces himself of that.A philosophical question is raised in the film: should Clark Kent have remained a simple man from Kansas and never have become the Superman? Should he just let people die and let calamities happen? The question is answered for us in the character of Diana Prince/Wonder Woman. She withdrew from mankind (her exact words) and just sat around watching. Watching while people died horrible deaths all around her. So, should Superman have done the same? Do these special beings, these 'metahumans', have some kind of moral imperative to intervene, or should they be allowed to be regular people, too? It seems that humans want it both ways.It seems that humans are saying: \"Don't be a superalien ... except when I and my friends and family are in trouble. Then come save us.\""

"Batman v Superman: Ultimate Edition: If your looking for a quick, cheap thrill then you might not enjoy this film at the time. This movies theatrical version was butchered by WB and in doing so reshaped the story leaving numerous plot holes. So the Ultimate Edition is the full story and the one worth seeing. Watch 'Man of Steel' before seeing this movie. There is much to claw through here, so much so that the audience might easily find themselves exhausted from the overall aggression of the film. However, a lot of the story does work. The action is good, and the emotion feels real most of the time.This film is about Superman trying to become Superman. Trying to help the world, save people, find a place in this world not as an outcast, and yet is looked at has a threat by many. Superman is not from this world, yet He is trying to be human, find a place in this world, be excepted by earths people, and come into his destiny.This film is also about Batman being Batman for 20 years and losing faith in humanity, and fearing Superman, what Superman can do with his powers. Great film, great plot, great visuals. ---Yidioo"
"I didn't see the film in the theaters and just bought the \"Extended Edition \" on Amazon. I never properly saw Man of Steel- i think I rented it and watched it when already exhausted and fell asleep. I saw the mediocre user reviews and horrible reviews from critics of this film.They really have it wrong. This is the very best either Batman or Superman. It has a different take, on things. Much darker then earlier films even darker then the Christopher Nolan Batman films.First of all Christopher Nolan is an Executive Producer. So how bad could it be? I loved Sucker Punch and Zack Snyder was involved with that. So how bad could this be? Hans Zimmer did the music, so how bad could it be?I remember watching the old Superman TV shows and reading the Superman and Batman comics as a little kid and loved them, but i wouldn't call myself a \"fan boy\" of comic universes, like so many younger people today. As an older adult I will admit my favorite TV show of all time was Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but watched it on DVD only after it had finished. I saw the second of the Dark Knight series in the theater, but the other two, I watched on DVD. They were great, but not my favorite films like so many people. i also loved the first couple Superman and Batman films in the older series. Regardless, i was not waiting with baited breath to see Man of Steel or this one.I'm more of a serious film fan, who can watch Stanley Kubrick films over and over and my favorite films in the last twenty years, are Eyes Wide Shut and Intersteller, both of which i've watched multiple times.So, with that said, take it from me, the critics have this film very wrong, just as critics hated 2001: A Space Odyssey when it first came out. This film will have lasting appreciation.Surprised how much I liked Ben Afleck's Batman. it was hard to get into Henry Cavil's scrawnier looking Superman, but it grew on me. Amy Adams was great as Lois Lane, The Gal Gadol Wonder Women was amazing. Lex Luther was terrific, like Nolan's Joker. Jeremy Irons was the best Alfred ever. Holly Hunter and Diane Lane was good too. The movie had bad reviews but made a billion dollars. Hopefully everyone buys the Ultimate Edition and it breaks sales records and the film is re-appreciated. I have no idea what scenes this Ultimate Edition added, but it is pretty perfect. Now I can't wait for Wonder Woman and the Justice League and as soon as I finish writing this am going to watch Man of Steal. I'm into it now!I can only surmise that the bad reviews stem from too much expectations of the rigid fan boy types and the radical changes in tone, we see in this film.Total masterpiece of cinema, but I have a few criticisms. There are a few hollow scenes of typical Idiot cops and authorities getting everything wrong in a cliché type way and it has a few filler scenes of that type and a few moments here and there that felt rushed and cheesy. Maybe not everything restored into the Ultimate Edition should have been. I wish there had been more Kevin Costner scenes."

"The whole entire Batman V Superman movie was great and yes even though it felt slow to the majority of the people who watched it but to me I enjoyed every part and every scene of Batman V Superman and when it got to the fight scenes both batman VS Superman and the Doomsday fight it brought so much drama, intensity, and epic performances. So with that being said I give this movie a good 10/10 because it really did go to my expectations and it brought a powerful performance and a powerful yet epic introduction to the upcoming Justice League."

"When I first wrote a review for this movie a year ago exclaiming my excitement for the film, I had been high off a fresh dose of live-action DC superheroes playing out the beloved comic book stories that I had grown up on. It was all playing out before my eyes and coming to life. After a few months had passed, I began to notice things about the movie that I disliked: little gaps in the story, things that didn't add up, etc. My original rating of a 10 / 10 dropped to an 8 /10. But today it has gone back up to a 10. The extended version of the film not only rectifies the gaps but also silences critics.Many claimed that the movie was too dark or that it just didn't make sense. To those people, I say: \"Pick up a comic book!\" Many of the critics of this particular film were part of the superhero bandwagon that formed when Marvel began its spree of Avengers-related films. In fact, its estimated that over 60% of people who go to see 'superhero' genre films have never picked up a comic book in their life. I would argue that similar numbers could figure to those which view the CW televised DC Universe shows. People complain that DC comics is just too dark but the fact is that these movies are based upon actual comics which are meant to be dark (ex: The Dark Knight Returns, Injustice, etc.). Its like complaining that Game of Thrones (the TV series) sucks because they kill off too many characters. Read the books! Its frustrating to see such a beautiful work of art like Batman V Superman criticized by those ignorant to its universe and its meaning. This movie is in fact a catalyst that opens numerous doorways and leaves true fans in awe of the possibilities for future movies. But regardless of whether or not people choose to educate themselves, this film's DVD/Blu-ray extended version puts the theater release to shame. All of the plot holes and gaps are filled in 30 minutes of extended footage scattered throughout the film. The movie ultimately becomes more complete and people will wish that the movie had shown the full 3 hours of footage in its theatrical debut. As a major DC comics fan, I will of course pick up on things that a comics fan would not, but someone who does not read comics would learn to appreciate this film in its entirety with the extended version. Get your hands on a copy today or find it on Netflix or the internet somewhere!"

"I ignored the bad reviews and watched anyways. This film had a lot to live up to after Civil War was released and I went into this film expecting the worst. It ended up to be the best Superhero film of 2016 to me. One complaint was that this film was more concerned about universe building than telling a great story than Civil War but for me it was the other way around; Civil War felt like a build up to something else and to be honest, I felt that way when I saw the other MCU films. Batman vs Superman however not only had a great story, but it also felt a lot more consistent than Civil War. This film was way more diverse with the cast than the MCU but unlike the MCU, I felt like this film doesn't go overboard with the SJW stuff like the MCU films or The Star Wars Sequel films do. The Visuals were AMAZING, The Score by Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL was AMAZING as well, The Tone is just right as I actually felt for the characters emotionally, The Cinematography kept my eyes glued to the screen, and the script felt really Intelligent and Complex and despite people calling the writing confusing, I was able to piece it together with no problem whatsoever. This film is similar to Empire Strikes back in terms of popularity so over time after the other movies are released, this movie would probably be more popular.This film was way better than I Expected and deserves another chance.

"Its shame to see what critics and marvel fans did to this movie and targeted Zack Snyder for it. I have seen this movie more than 25 times till date. And i enjoy this movie as much as i enjoyed the first time. The fans who have read DC comics, wouldn't be disappointed in this movie. Its dark movie, yes it is. Because the title shows the intense situation at hand. Two superheroes about to rip each other apart for whatever reasons that brought them to this stage. Yes it had to be dark and intense.Only marvel can be stupid enough to show an alien invasion where humans are loosing the battle and the super heroes are cracking jokes while battles as if they are playing ping pong. a person playing Call of Duty game is more serious while playing than the marvel heroes fighting aliens."

"Last week some news came out from somebody online who had claimed to have seen a finished version of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. If you were like me, you've been leery of checking it out because you weren't sure how much might actually be true. Now Zack Snyder has spoken out about the spoiler-filled post, although his response doesn't really clear anything up.In a word, to MTV, he called the post \"hilarious,which might imply that he's saying that it's mostly, if not entirely, untrue. That might be the case, but then again he could have just said it was untrue and he didn't say that. What he did say, however, is that he doesn't like spoilers. While this may seem odd for the director who's most recent trailer appeared to give away the entire movie, Snyder says that's not the case. Even if you've seen the trailer, you can rest easy, as there is much more we have not seen in then finished film. Says Snyder I have the benefit of seeing the movie. It's cool that think it's too much, and I appreciate people not wanting to know, but there's plenty that they don't know. There's a lot of movie that's not in the trailer. In the process of calling the Batman v Superman Reddit review hilarious, Snyder goes on to talk about how he hates it when spoilers come out. The director would much rather that fans see the movie mostly blind. While he understands that some fans may wish to find the answers before hand, he wants his movies to be mysteries going in. If you're, as an audience member, exploring these articles, looking for answers to questions that you have, maybe you're okay with knowing before you go. It's like an individual taste. But like I said, I want people to see the movie without knowing.Spoilers are a topic that mean different things to different people. While most try to avoid them to some degree, the need to solve the mystery is a nearly universal human experience. We have an inclination to want to know the truth, even while also wanting to be surprised. For most of us getting some information is good, but getting all the information is bad, of course, only getting the details that you want can be difficult."
"The theatrical is choppy, poorly edited, hard to follow, with some really good moments mixed in their. The extended is much more fluent and is much easier to follow, it does have a long runtime, which might make it seem a bit dragging on, but if you like long films done right, like Lord of the Rings, you will like this movie as long as you get into the characters and story. Speaking of which, the story starts out perfectly showing Bruce Wayne as a character, and it is very powerful. There are several moments in this movie that are powerful, emotional, and shocking. Characters. Batman is my favorite fictional character of all time, and believe me when I say, Ben Affleck as Batman was perfect, he had the charisma, the anger, and the look of being through some bad stuff Gal Gadot also does perfect as Wonder Woman, but if you want to really see how good she does, go watch the Wonder Woman movie. Henry Call as Superman. I really don't like it when people say Christopher Reeves is better. Don't get me wrong, Reeves does great, but can you imagine him as Superman in this movie? I wouldn't like it. It would be like Adam West playing Batman in The Dark Knight. Henry Cavill does great in this role, I can say everything about him as I said with Ben Affleck. Jesse Eisenberg as Luthor. I thought it was different in a good way. I've heard a criticism for him as being too much like Joker, but is that a bad thing? Joker is my favorite villain, so to see Superman have an enemy that crazy, but still hold the values Luthor needs to be Luthor, I think it is great. The thing I thought this movie was lacking in the first and second acts was humor, at least good humor. If there was more humor, I would've given this movie a ten because it would give a more relaxing feel to the parts that needed it. All in all though, this movie was awesome, it had powerful moments, it was badass, and just plain fun. It had a great story arc and does its job very well."

"*I will be talking about the Ultimate Edition of the film* This was one of the most anticipated CBM of all time. Ever since the arrival and subsequent success of Marvel's The Avengers people have wondered when will DC launch its own cinematic universe, one of the main reasons being the opportunity to finally see titans such as Batman and Superman share the screen together: the ultimate nerd dream. On 2016, the moment finally came for BvS to be released AND.. it performed poorly. Not only did critical reception left a lot to be desired, but fan reactions where surprisingly split after its cinematic debut. People either loved it and called Zack a genius, or hated it and called him a hack. Me, personally, I found myself with middle of the road feelings, for sure, but more leaning towards the negative side with subsequent viewings. The theatrical cut of the film showcased amazing performances, incredible visuals, and action set pieces that seemed like comic book panels come to life, in a good way. However, when it comes to its narrative structure and more technical aspects like editing, the film was seriously flawed. More plot holes than Age of Ultron, questionable character decisions, random editing that lacked cohesion and focus, and forced dramatic moments that lacked any impact because the attempts at character development ranged from limited to nonexistent, especially when it comes to Superman's character. I thought it was a 5/10 movie at best. As such, I was kind of skeptical about the idea of a 30 minute longer version. I say kind of because I know how Zack works. I remember Watchmen being vastly improved with its director's cut, so in a way I was expecting BvS to perform in a similar manner, but I also feared those 30 minutes wold be just there to amplify action and discredit storytelling issues. Oh boy, I'm so glad I was proved wrong. The ultimate cut of the film was infuriating, but not because it was awful, but because it questions the sanity of WB executives and editors and makes you wonder what were they thinking during the editing process. What I got out of the Ultimate Edition was a thought-provoking deconstruction of two very iconic superheroes that gave spotlight to the struggles both of them face when they aren't fighting crime. What I got was an extremely well produced character study on both Batman and Superman in a cynical world, a world dangerously close to our own. We meet Batman as a ruthless, worn out hero that has seen the failure behind his ideals and witnessed some truly horrifying things in his life. Superman, on the other hand, is portrayed as a godlike figure that seeks to do good in the world, but finds himself emotionally conflicted once he realized that every good deed he does leaves behind a trail of destruction (most of it due to Luthor's antics). In my opinion, this is a hugely original approach, one that distances itself from the rest of the competition and delivers a dark, somber, yet relevant superhero movie that understands both characters and gives them real human struggles to deal with. I felt invested in both of them, and hoped that by the end of the film both could find a way to redeem themselves. Their character arcs were very well established during the first two acts of the movie, and by the time we get to the titular climactic battle the emotion behind the jaw-dropping action is intensified. Lex Luthor as a villain was also given more time to develop with this new edition. One of the main criticisms with the original version was the fact that his plan relied too much on conveniences, and the character's mannerisms and mad-scientist attitude was annoying, and that goes without saying his motivations were unclear. Not only do we spend more time understanding his hate for any godlike figure and thus his hatred for Superman, but the added scenes allowed us to witness his entire plan come to fruition. It sells the cold, manipulative, calculating attributes of his comic counterpart. The acting is spot on. Every actor owns his/her role, from Cavill's Superman, to Ben Affleck as Batman, Eisenberg as Luthor, and Gadot as Wonder Woman, whose scenes are brief, but are more than enough to sell the strong and ferocious warrior that she is. Cinematography is stunning, and miles above that of Man of Steel's. And the soundtrack by Zimmer and Junkie XL? Perfect, just perfect. When it comes to flaws, the film still has some of those. The Martha moment, while serving as a pivotal character moment for Batman, felt off in execution, and its understandable that many people got mad at it. If your main complaint about BvS the first time around was its bleak tone and subject matter, this film is still not for you. I understand most were expecting to see the heroes being the most iconic versions of themselves, clashing in an elongated battle and evoking the same feelings The Avengers gave audiences back in 2012. In that sense, the film will remain divisive, but at least I have the comfort of saying that, at the very least, the film is competently made."

"This film was amazing. Ben Affleck was easily the best part of this movie, he brought his a-game as Batman. The chemistry between Affleck & Irons was outstanding. Gal Gadot did a great job as Wonder Woman. The fight between Batman & Superman was awesome. The final fight with Doomsday was outstanding in every way possible. However, there is only one problem with this film and that's Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor. He was sadly missed cast in this role, but then again it's really the fault of Warner Bros. Studios. Overall, this film deliver on almost every level. I highly recommend that you watch the extended version of this film."

"I know I know. I saw it in theaters too, and felt like it could've been so much better. While the Batman element was good, the narrative felt fractured, and the third act was just one long stunt scene. Superman was relegated to a supporting character, and other characters didn't get a chance to shine. And then I chanced on the ultimate cut. Calling it 30 mins of \"extra\" footage is unfair to Zack Snyder because it's exactly these 30 mins that makes the movie a worthy one. What I can say about the theatrical cut is this - It had the blockbuster elements - music, visuals, stunts, CGI. But, it lacked the human elements. The first 20 mins of the movie had it, but not after that. The extended cut in comparison has a flow to the narrative. There are no disjointed scenes, everything flows smoothly, and there's connective tissue. Superman gets to spend some time with his father, and mother. Clark Kent does some investigative journalism. Superman helps the people after the blast. Lois Lane doesn't jump to conclusions, she gets to the bottom of the crime. Lex Luthor apparently had a coherent plan - everything is explained pretty well. Wonder Woman was already good, so there's no change there :) Also, the \"Martha\" scene seems better executed, because it is a few seconds longer, and there's time to breathe it in. So, here's my take on this movie - The theatrical cut was junk. Get the Bluray for ultimate edition, and you shall not be disappointed. I've seen it so many more times now, and it's the definitive cut. It is the movie we deserve. It's a unique take on Batman, and Superman. It's a gritty take on the superhero movie genre, and definitely the best DCEU movie, and the best DC movie since The Dark Knight.P.S. Yes it's dark. We're adults, and we should appreciate mature film making without intentionally silly moments. It attempts to be philosophical, and something deep instead of just trying to make you chuckle."

"This is one of the best superhero movies ever made. Zack Snyder is a magician behind the camera.The reason behind so many complaints is the fact that Warner Bros. marketed this movie as a fight between Batman and Superman. That's not what it is. It's a movie about the origins of the Justice League.The cinematography, the acting and the score are all second to none. This film is phenomenal.P.S: watch the 3 hour extended cut that Snyder intended you to see, not the 2 and a half hour movie that Warner Bros. decided would be better for theaters."

"I don't care what the critics say, this is a very well-done movie. I'll start my review by listing what I like about the movie.1.) Ben Affleck is the best batman to me and it is not close. He pulls off the role of an aging batman extremely well. Also, Zack Snyder's vision of batman is legit. I have always hated batman up until this adaptation of him. Instead of being a conflicted and idealistic batman, this batman is dark, gritty, and 100% a badass. His equipment is decked out with machine guns and he has no aversion to killing people. In fact, he probably kills about 50 criminal by the time this movie is over. The warehouse scene is the coolest batman scene in any movie.2.) The development of a grudge between batman and superman is pulled off flawlessly. It actually makes sense why batman dislikes superman. Then, when they do fight it is about the coolest thing you can expect to see from a superhero film. 3.) I disagree with a lot of people about Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor. In my opinion, he played his role to perfection. 4.) B v S sets up Wonder Woman and Justice League with Gal Gadot's cameo as Wonder Woman and short clips of Aquaman, the Flash, and Cyborg. B v S is one of my favorite superhero films and rewatching it never gets old."

"The theatrical cut of this film is garbage which is why I rated it eight stars instead of nine. The first time I watched this film I didn't like it (not straight out hate but didn't like). Character motivations didn't make any sense, Lex was annoying as s***, editing was sloppy, and it was overly dark and broody for an action superhero movie. A year + a half, five Marvel films, a ton of bad reviews and a Justice League later a thought popped into my head: \"what if I watched BVS again\". This time I didn't have trailers ruining the best moments, I only vaguely remembered the film, and I was conditioned to look at it negatively but something unexpected happened: I actually loved it. Superman was just a normal person that tried to make a difference cause he could that others imposed their own beliefs on. Lex Luthor was a genius that couldn't stand his powerlessness compared to Superman or more accurately a super being. As Alfred said \"The fever, the rage, the feeling of powerlessness that turns good men... cruel\" and you see the same thought process in Batman. Batman, just like Lex Luthor feels powerless in the midst of a god-being and just like Lex he attempts to destroy him so he can get his sense of power back but unlike Lex, Batman learns something. I what is one of the corniest lines of the movie Superman says, \"Martha\" when he knows he can't win against Batman in a late desperate attempt to save his mother. Not only does this name connect with Bruce Wayne but it also shows what really matters to a man of steel: it isn't power, it isn't fame or anything else, it is his Mother and on a broader scale it is people. Lex (who doesn't care about people at all) knows he doesn't have the power so he creates something from his blood and the remains of Zod: A Doomsday for Superman. Not only does this film have depth but it also doesn't always explain it to you which is rare in a blockbuster action superhero flick normally cater to semi-comic book fans and people that want to shove popcorn in their mouths. This film rewards you for really noticing the details while still having massive explosions. One of my favorites is how Lex has all of Batman's branded killed which is why he isn't afraid of the branding at the end or Grandma's Peach Tea as a way of scaring the s*** out of someone. Of course, this film isn't perfect and I do have personal dislikes. The Batman V Superman fight was slow and pretty boring especially after watching such an amazing fight in Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 2 (If you haven't watched the animated Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 1 and 2 you are sorely missing out on something fantastic). Also, the addition of Wonder Woman who pretty much steals a hacker thing, gives it back and then suits up and fights against a giant monster thing. Not to say I don't like Wonder Woman (She is one of my favorite Superheroes of all time who showed not only can woman kick a** but they also don't need to be ashamed of their sexuality or gender) but she wasn't really that helpful to the plot and just brought in to expand the universe which was well done through Lex's superhuman hunting files. Also, the post-apocalyptic scene that was just a dream could have been cut but nothing is perfect except movies like Citizen Kane which isn't a lot of fun to watch cause it is too perfect. So to summarize, the theatrical cut is bad, the ultimate cut is Amazing and the other cut is meh. Please give it a second chance because it deserves it and save a good director from losing grace because of something he didn't do."
"I really liked it, don't know what all the hate is about. I'm actually a Marvel fan from when I was 7 or so, but Superman and Batman together in 1 movie? Just great. And personally I like Ben Affleck even better than Christian Bale as Batman. So just watch and enjoy, I know I did!"

"That's right. We have been waiting for these two heroes to finally meet and fight against each other. This movie is so good in both plot and special effects.Henry Cavill and Ben Affleck have performed well in their acting stages. They are the best superhero actors and they have filmed their fighting scenes very well. The movie starts to show the conflict between the lives of the heroes and now they have blamed each other for it. This movie is amazing and sets up a good plot for Dawn Justice."

"Actually...I didn't know what to expect. When you see Wonder Woman, you know it will be off of Wonder Woman and off of a Wonder Woman story, but with Batman V Superman, I was like, \"hmmmm, so who is this about?\" It was pretty obvious that it would feature many characters, but I thought the introduction to Batman was amazing. Ben Affleck nailed the part, not only as Batman but also as Bruce Wayne. He is my Batman. Henry Cavill continued to be super as the Man of Steel. And he is my Super - Man. A dark story? Yes, without a doubt. Could it have had a few more jokes? Sure. But not all movies or stories need to have jokes when certain events are serious. I really hope people can see this review and take another look at the movie, because, I loved it. I really hope the ratings can go up, eventually. And P.S, this movie is the perfect set up to Justice League."

"I'll start by making it clear I have only ever seen the Ultimate Edition. I'm aware of what was cut out for the theatrical release, so I will concede up front that most of the criticisms about pacing, editing, and missing bits of plot at release were merited.With that caveat out of the way, I must reiterate that this was bar-none the boldest superhero movie I have ever seen. To me, it was arguably the best as well, though \"best\" shouldn't be taken to mean \"most enjoyable.\" That honor easily goes to \"Thor: Ragnarok.\" What makes BvS stand out among other films in the genre is that it takes two characters who have been done to death since the 1970s and brings them up to date. I recently tried to watch \"Superman: The Movie\" for the first time in a number of years, and while it was still good and Reeves will always be iconic, I just couldn't take it seriously. I'll put it this way: If the story in BvS was \"stupid\" in your view but Superman turning back time by spinning the earth backward on its axis didn't seem like one of the dumbest things you have ever seen -in any movie from any genre- to the extent that it outright ruins the movie for you, then your opinion about BvS isn't worth much. Nostalgic bias was always going to be a problem for this movie, and the way people reacted to and reviewed \"Man of Steel\" was telling in this regard.That brings me to Zack Snyder's take on Superman. You know, that guy whose status as the first extraterrestrial ever encountered by humanity was a total non-issue in the old movies. Apparently, Snyder has a similar view to my own in that his take on the Man of Steel makes his being an alien a core piece of his identity. He may look like any other (absurdly attractive) person, but he knows what he is, and that makes him perpetually uncertain of where he fits in this world. He is essentially good and really does care about people, but he struggles to truly empathize with the likes of us. To be human is to be frail, and that is not something he can easily relate to. This is the root of his conflict with Batman.Just as Clark struggles to genuinely relate to most people, Snyder's Batman either refuses to or otherwise just can't relate to Superman. He doesn't see him as anything but a threat regardless of Superman's clear good intentions. Remember, a small group of Kryptonians were able to bring humanity to the brink of extinction in less than a day, and Bruce Wayne is nothing if not a realist. He didn't know the guy from Kansas. He only knew the god from another world.While Batman's anger toward and fear of Superman are readily apparent from the start, Superman's inability to imagine things from Bruce Wayne's perspective only becomes truly apparent during their first real interaction. This reminded me of the animated version of the \"world's finest\" storyline, where Superman judges Batman harshly for using fear tactics and threats of violence (also, actual violence) to get the job done. Superman wasn't willing to consider what it would take for a human man to fight criminals and save innocents, or what that life would do to him over time. Just as Batman didn't see the guy from Kansas, Superman didn't see the man who lives his life trapped in one brutal, unthinkably traumatic moment (this was beautifully conveyed during the film's opening moments), and had spent his whole adult life bearing witness to humanity at its absolute worst.The conflict between these two characters is as old as human history. They want the same things, but they can't understand one another. So they fight. And what a fight it was.Watching a fight between, say, Captain America and Iron Man was, to me, more frustrating than anything because each understood the other's perspective perfectly. The fight between Batman and Superman in BvS was genuinely gut-wrenching, as intended, because they would have understood one another if either had tried. The whole sequence hilighted Batman's tactical prowess and ability to control a situation. Maybe the most badass thing about the fight was that it ended exactly where Batman planned. That brings me to the big elephant in the room named \"Martha.\"I can't recall exactly which YouTuber put it this way, but if you thought the \"save Martha\" exchange was about their mothers having the same name, you had your brain turned off. The brain-on people have explained this to death, but it bears repeating. This was the moment when Superman became humanized to Batman. He was about to die, and his only concern was for his adoptive human mother. He still believed that the man about to take his life would do the right thing. Even with the cowl on, there was no mistaking the look on Batman's face. It was the look of shame, guilt, and sudden uncertainty that says \"What am I doing?\" Turns out even the most brutal, angry version of Bruce Wayne is better than Tony Stark at knowing right from wrong. At knowing that he had gone too far.From there, the third act was a series of truly impressive (albeit mostly CGI) fight sequences, beginning with what I regard as the undisputed champion of Batman fights. Nothing in the Nolan movies (and especially nothing in the Burton movies) even came close. Go ahead, try to convince yourself that Batman and Bane taking turns punching one another in the face until Bane's mask broke was a good fight sequence. No, this was a fight straight out of \"Arkham Knight,\" and it was glorious. The battle against Doomsday really was one for the books. From the moment Wonder Woman arrived accompanied by the intense sounds of Tina Guo's electric cello to Superman's tragic, heroic death at the hands of Doomsday, I was glued to the screen. Sure, the mere presence of Doomsday spoiled the end to a degree, but watching the Man of Steel laboring to carry that kryptonite spear towards certain death was no less impactful. A brief word on Jesse Eisenberg's take on Lex Luthor. At least one other reviewer on this site already said it best when they pointed out that this was his origin story. If you consider his scheme objectively, he is actually one of the more formidable incarnations of the character. If we're lucky, we'll eventually get to see a Snyder Cut of \"Justice League\" and find out where this story was actually meant to go. For the record, Joss Whedon and Danny Elfman both should have said \"no\" to taking a dump on someone else's art."
"BATMAN V SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE brings a fantastic surprise to a smash-hit team-up with one of the worlds most beloved DC Comics' icons of all time. The movie delivers spectacular casting, and fantastic acting with different characters having their shine in each scenes.The story follows Clark Kent/Superman who becomes a threat, after the destruction in Metropolis in Man Of Steel.(2013). Batman/Bruce Wayne sees him as a threat and begins his war on Superman.The movie brings spectacular storytelling, it tells the complications of human against alien who are on the same side, and the first meeting of Batman and Superman. The story of Bruce Wayne, with his many years of The Caped Crusader, sends him on a spiral of \"out of control\", sheer anger, and builds tension to wanting to defeat the Man of Steel. Snyder has fantastically gave this storytelling an exciting nod to the comics.Lex Luthor, played by Jesse Einsberg, delivers a very interesting performance, but very differently by him showing is his \"origin\" before he becomes a bald foe to the Man of Steel. He shows that his love of \"god vs man\" terrorises mankind when he ultimately creates Doomsday, and Batman realises Superman's inner heroism.It packs so many great \"out of nowhere\" excitement, including a first-look of the fearful Wonder Woman a.k.a. Diana Prince, played by Gal Gadot, and a fresh-new glimpse of the superhero DC canon: The Justice League.WATCH THIS MOVIE! The critics are out of their mind. It's a fun-packed action adventure which still keeps the movie enjoyable until it's final minutes of the movie. It's a FANTASTIC MOVIE! BEN AFFLECK AS BATMAN... is Incredible!A 10/10 overall!"
"I want to go on record as saying that this is a truly thrilling cinematic experience in so many ways. If pressed, I guess I could acknowledge that there were a couple ... let's say \"clumsy\" moments. And in a film that runs to three hours, that hardly seems like a significant issue, certainly not enough to rate it with fewer than 9 stars.This film has everything. There is dramatic tension right from the start. There is a magnificent story arc that picks up quite seamlessly from 'Man of Steel' and propels the viewer not only into the life of Clark Kent/Superman but also of Bruce Wayne/Batman.The villain is no mere cartoon of a villain; he is truly thoroughly (and apparently irrevocably) diabolical. He is a psychopath, and you wish for his death over and over and over. You want Superman to reduce him to ash with the power of his eyes.I have read a number of viewers' reviews, and it seems that the people who disliked the film / gave it a low rating had rather unfair and unrealistic expectations of it. That is, their own prejudices about how the plot could/should unfold or what the character development could/should be, etc. ruined the film for them. And that is a shame.My thought is: I settle into my seat, wait for the lights to dim, and then I wait to be transported by the film. I accept it, lock, stock, and barrel.As another reviewer remarked, I love how the film begins from the point of view of Bruce Wayne as he is among people on the ground who have fallen victim to the attack of Zod and the other Kryptonians.Why would Bruce Wayne not like Superman? Why would the good people of Earth hurl insults at Superman and burn him in effigy (on the news)? Because the good people of Earth just got catapulted into a new reality in which there are not only extraterrestrial beings (surprise!) but they are also superman! And a group of them are hell-bent on destroying humankind and taking the planet for themselves.It is difficult to see Superman as separate from the whole Kryptonian Krew.It seems that many moviegoers forgot that Bruce Wayne is also human. Sure, he's a hero, but he is flawed.. Just like the rest of us. He is a vigilante, after all.He has let his vigilantism get the better of him. HE is actually the one working outside the boundaries of the law, not Superman. It is the clear head of Alfred that shows us that he has gone into a rather dark place, that he has not seen what is really going on (in Luthor's scheme), and so he chooses to embark on his own scheme scheme to take out the alien invader. He is (allegedly) thinking of the future: if he wipes out the all-powerful alien, then it can't turn on humankind in the future. At least, he convinces himself of that.A philosophical question is raised in the film: should Clark Kent have remained a simple man from Kansas and never have become the Superman? Should he just let people die and let calamities happen? The question is answered for us in the character of Diana Prince/Wonder Woman. She withdrew from mankind (her exact words) and just sat around watching. Watching while people died horrible deaths all around her. So, should Superman have done the same? Do these special beings, these 'metahumans', have some kind of moral imperative to intervene, or should they be allowed to be regular people, too? It seems that humans want it both ways.It seems that humans are saying: \"Don't be a superalien ... except when I and my friends and family are in trouble. Then come save us.\""

"Batman v Superman: Ultimate Edition: If your looking for a quick, cheap thrill then you might not enjoy this film at the time. This movies theatrical version was butchered by WB and in doing so reshaped the story leaving numerous plot holes. So the Ultimate Edition is the full story and the one worth seeing. Watch 'Man of Steel' before seeing this movie. There is much to claw through here, so much so that the audience might easily find themselves exhausted from the overall aggression of the film. However, a lot of the story does work. The action is good, and the emotion feels real most of the time.This film is about Superman trying to become Superman. Trying to help the world, save people, find a place in this world not as an outcast, and yet is looked at has a threat by many. Superman is not from this world, yet He is trying to be human, find a place in this world, be excepted by earths people, and come into his destiny.This film is also about Batman being Batman for 20 years and losing faith in humanity, and fearing Superman, what Superman can do with his powers. Great film, great plot, great visuals. ---Yidioo"
"I didn't see the film in the theaters and just bought the \"Extended Edition \" on Amazon. I never properly saw Man of Steel- i think I rented it and watched it when already exhausted and fell asleep. I saw the mediocre user reviews and horrible reviews from critics of this film.They really have it wrong. This is the very best either Batman or Superman. It has a different take, on things. Much darker then earlier films even darker then the Christopher Nolan Batman films.First of all Christopher Nolan is an Executive Producer. So how bad could it be? I loved Sucker Punch and Zack Snyder was involved with that. So how bad could this be? Hans Zimmer did the music, so how bad could it be?I remember watching the old Superman TV shows and reading the Superman and Batman comics as a little kid and loved them, but i wouldn't call myself a \"fan boy\" of comic universes, like so many younger people today. As an older adult I will admit my favorite TV show of all time was Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but watched it on DVD only after it had finished. I saw the second of the Dark Knight series in the theater, but the other two, I watched on DVD. They were great, but not my favorite films like so many people. i also loved the first couple Superman and Batman films in the older series. Regardless, i was not waiting with baited breath to see Man of Steel or this one.I'm more of a serious film fan, who can watch Stanley Kubrick films over and over and my favorite films in the last twenty years, are Eyes Wide Shut and Intersteller, both of which i've watched multiple times.So, with that said, take it from me, the critics have this film very wrong, just as critics hated 2001: A Space Odyssey when it first came out. This film will have lasting appreciation.Surprised how much I liked Ben Afleck's Batman. it was hard to get into Henry Cavil's scrawnier looking Superman, but it grew on me. Amy Adams was great as Lois Lane, The Gal Gadol Wonder Women was amazing. Lex Luther was terrific, like Nolan's Joker. Jeremy Irons was the best Alfred ever. Holly Hunter and Diane Lane was good too. The movie had bad reviews but made a billion dollars. Hopefully everyone buys the Ultimate Edition and it breaks sales records and the film is re-appreciated. I have no idea what scenes this Ultimate Edition added, but it is pretty perfect. Now I can't wait for Wonder Woman and the Justice League and as soon as I finish writing this am going to watch Man of Steal. I'm into it now!I can only surmise that the bad reviews stem from too much expectations of the rigid fan boy types and the radical changes in tone, we see in this film.Total masterpiece of cinema, but I have a few criticisms. There are a few hollow scenes of typical Idiot cops and authorities getting everything wrong in a cliché type way and it has a few filler scenes of that type and a few moments here and there that felt rushed and cheesy. Maybe not everything restored into the Ultimate Edition should have been. I wish there had been more Kevin Costner scenes."

"The whole entire Batman V Superman movie was great and yes even though it felt slow to the majority of the people who watched it but to me I enjoyed every part and every scene of Batman V Superman and when it got to the fight scenes both batman VS Superman and the Doomsday fight it brought so much drama, intensity, and epic performances. So with that being said I give this movie a good 10/10 because it really did go to my expectations and it brought a powerful performance and a powerful yet epic introduction to the upcoming Justice League."

"When I first wrote a review for this movie a year ago exclaiming my excitement for the film, I had been high off a fresh dose of live-action DC superheroes playing out the beloved comic book stories that I had grown up on. It was all playing out before my eyes and coming to life. After a few months had passed, I began to notice things about the movie that I disliked: little gaps in the story, things that didn't add up, etc. My original rating of a 10 / 10 dropped to an 8 /10. But today it has gone back up to a 10. The extended version of the film not only rectifies the gaps but also silences critics.Many claimed that the movie was too dark or that it just didn't make sense. To those people, I say: \"Pick up a comic book!\" Many of the critics of this particular film were part of the superhero bandwagon that formed when Marvel began its spree of Avengers-related films. In fact, its estimated that over 60% of people who go to see 'superhero' genre films have never picked up a comic book in their life. I would argue that similar numbers could figure to those which view the CW televised DC Universe shows. People complain that DC comics is just too dark but the fact is that these movies are based upon actual comics which are meant to be dark (ex: The Dark Knight Returns, Injustice, etc.). Its like complaining that Game of Thrones (the TV series) sucks because they kill off too many characters. Read the books! Its frustrating to see such a beautiful work of art like Batman V Superman criticized by those ignorant to its universe and its meaning. This movie is in fact a catalyst that opens numerous doorways and leaves true fans in awe of the possibilities for future movies. But regardless of whether or not people choose to educate themselves, this film's DVD/Blu-ray extended version puts the theater release to shame. All of the plot holes and gaps are filled in 30 minutes of extended footage scattered throughout the film. The movie ultimately becomes more complete and people will wish that the movie had shown the full 3 hours of footage in its theatrical debut. As a major DC comics fan, I will of course pick up on things that a comics fan would not, but someone who does not read comics would learn to appreciate this film in its entirety with the extended version. Get your hands on a copy today or find it on Netflix or the internet somewhere!"

"I ignored the bad reviews and watched anyways. This film had a lot to live up to after Civil War was released and I went into this film expecting the worst. It ended up to be the best Superhero film of 2016 to me. One complaint was that this film was more concerned about universe building than telling a great story than Civil War but for me it was the other way around; Civil War felt like a build up to something else and to be honest, I felt that way when I saw the other MCU films. Batman vs Superman however not only had a great story, but it also felt a lot more consistent than Civil War. This film was way more diverse with the cast than the MCU but unlike the MCU, I felt like this film doesn't go overboard with the SJW stuff like the MCU films or The Star Wars Sequel films do. The Visuals were AMAZING, The Score by Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL was AMAZING as well, The Tone is just right as I actually felt for the characters emotionally, The Cinematography kept my eyes glued to the screen, and the script felt really Intelligent and Complex and despite people calling the writing confusing, I was able to piece it together with no problem whatsoever. This film is similar to Empire Strikes back in terms of popularity so over time after the other movies are released, this movie would probably be more popular.This film was way better than I Expected and deserves another chance.

"Its shame to see what critics and marvel fans did to this movie and targeted Zack Snyder for it. I have seen this movie more than 25 times till date. And i enjoy this movie as much as i enjoyed the first time. The fans who have read DC comics, wouldn't be disappointed in this movie. Its dark movie, yes it is. Because the title shows the intense situation at hand. Two superheroes about to rip each other apart for whatever reasons that brought them to this stage. Yes it had to be dark and intense.Only marvel can be stupid enough to show an alien invasion where humans are loosing the battle and the super heroes are cracking jokes while battles as if they are playing ping pong. a person playing Call of Duty game is more serious while playing than the marvel heroes fighting aliens."

"Last week some news came out from somebody online who had claimed to have seen a finished version of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. If you were like me, you've been leery of checking it out because you weren't sure how much might actually be true. Now Zack Snyder has spoken out about the spoiler-filled post, although his response doesn't really clear anything up.In a word, to MTV, he called the post \"hilarious,which might imply that he's saying that it's mostly, if not entirely, untrue. That might be the case, but then again he could have just said it was untrue and he didn't say that. What he did say, however, is that he doesn't like spoilers. While this may seem odd for the director who's most recent trailer appeared to give away the entire movie, Snyder says that's not the case. Even if you've seen the trailer, you can rest easy, as there is much more we have not seen in then finished film. Says Snyder I have the benefit of seeing the movie. It's cool that think it's too much, and I appreciate people not wanting to know, but there's plenty that they don't know. There's a lot of movie that's not in the trailer. In the process of calling the Batman v Superman Reddit review hilarious, Snyder goes on to talk about how he hates it when spoilers come out. The director would much rather that fans see the movie mostly blind. While he understands that some fans may wish to find the answers before hand, he wants his movies to be mysteries going in. If you're, as an audience member, exploring these articles, looking for answers to questions that you have, maybe you're okay with knowing before you go. It's like an individual taste. But like I said, I want people to see the movie without knowing.Spoilers are a topic that mean different things to different people. While most try to avoid them to some degree, the need to solve the mystery is a nearly universal human experience. We have an inclination to want to know the truth, even while also wanting to be surprised. For most of us getting some information is good, but getting all the information is bad, of course, only getting the details that you want can be difficult."
"The theatrical is choppy, poorly edited, hard to follow, with some really good moments mixed in their. The extended is much more fluent and is much easier to follow, it does have a long runtime, which might make it seem a bit dragging on, but if you like long films done right, like Lord of the Rings, you will like this movie as long as you get into the characters and story. Speaking of which, the story starts out perfectly showing Bruce Wayne as a character, and it is very powerful. There are several moments in this movie that are powerful, emotional, and shocking. Characters. Batman is my favorite fictional character of all time, and believe me when I say, Ben Affleck as Batman was perfect, he had the charisma, the anger, and the look of being through some bad stuff Gal Gadot also does perfect as Wonder Woman, but if you want to really see how good she does, go watch the Wonder Woman movie. Henry Call as Superman. I really don't like it when people say Christopher Reeves is better. Don't get me wrong, Reeves does great, but can you imagine him as Superman in this movie? I wouldn't like it. It would be like Adam West playing Batman in The Dark Knight. Henry Cavill does great in this role, I can say everything about him as I said with Ben Affleck. Jesse Eisenberg as Luthor. I thought it was different in a good way. I've heard a criticism for him as being too much like Joker, but is that a bad thing? Joker is my favorite villain, so to see Superman have an enemy that crazy, but still hold the values Luthor needs to be Luthor, I think it is great. The thing I thought this movie was lacking in the first and second acts was humor, at least good humor. If there was more humor, I would've given this movie a ten because it would give a more relaxing feel to the parts that needed it. All in all though, this movie was awesome, it had powerful moments, it was badass, and just plain fun. It had a great story arc and does its job very well."

"*I will be talking about the Ultimate Edition of the film* This was one of the most anticipated CBM of all time. Ever since the arrival and subsequent success of Marvel's The Avengers people have wondered when will DC launch its own cinematic universe, one of the main reasons being the opportunity to finally see titans such as Batman and Superman share the screen together: the ultimate nerd dream. On 2016, the moment finally came for BvS to be released AND.. it performed poorly. Not only did critical reception left a lot to be desired, but fan reactions where surprisingly split after its cinematic debut. People either loved it and called Zack a genius, or hated it and called him a hack. Me, personally, I found myself with middle of the road feelings, for sure, but more leaning towards the negative side with subsequent viewings. The theatrical cut of the film showcased amazing performances, incredible visuals, and action set pieces that seemed like comic book panels come to life, in a good way. However, when it comes to its narrative structure and more technical aspects like editing, the film was seriously flawed. More plot holes than Age of Ultron, questionable character decisions, random editing that lacked cohesion and focus, and forced dramatic moments that lacked any impact because the attempts at character development ranged from limited to nonexistent, especially when it comes to Superman's character. I thought it was a 5/10 movie at best. As such, I was kind of skeptical about the idea of a 30 minute longer version. I say kind of because I know how Zack works. I remember Watchmen being vastly improved with its director's cut, so in a way I was expecting BvS to perform in a similar manner, but I also feared those 30 minutes wold be just there to amplify action and discredit storytelling issues. Oh boy, I'm so glad I was proved wrong. The ultimate cut of the film was infuriating, but not because it was awful, but because it questions the sanity of WB executives and editors and makes you wonder what were they thinking during the editing process. What I got out of the Ultimate Edition was a thought-provoking deconstruction of two very iconic superheroes that gave spotlight to the struggles both of them face when they aren't fighting crime. What I got was an extremely well produced character study on both Batman and Superman in a cynical world, a world dangerously close to our own. We meet Batman as a ruthless, worn out hero that has seen the failure behind his ideals and witnessed some truly horrifying things in his life. Superman, on the other hand, is portrayed as a godlike figure that seeks to do good in the world, but finds himself emotionally conflicted once he realized that every good deed he does leaves behind a trail of destruction (most of it due to Luthor's antics). In my opinion, this is a hugely original approach, one that distances itself from the rest of the competition and delivers a dark, somber, yet relevant superhero movie that understands both characters and gives them real human struggles to deal with. I felt invested in both of them, and hoped that by the end of the film both could find a way to redeem themselves. Their character arcs were very well established during the first two acts of the movie, and by the time we get to the titular climactic battle the emotion behind the jaw-dropping action is intensified. Lex Luthor as a villain was also given more time to develop with this new edition. One of the main criticisms with the original version was the fact that his plan relied too much on conveniences, and the character's mannerisms and mad-scientist attitude was annoying, and that goes without saying his motivations were unclear. Not only do we spend more time understanding his hate for any godlike figure and thus his hatred for Superman, but the added scenes allowed us to witness his entire plan come to fruition. It sells the cold, manipulative, calculating attributes of his comic counterpart. The acting is spot on. Every actor owns his/her role, from Cavill's Superman, to Ben Affleck as Batman, Eisenberg as Luthor, and Gadot as Wonder Woman, whose scenes are brief, but are more than enough to sell the strong and ferocious warrior that she is. Cinematography is stunning, and miles above that of Man of Steel's. And the soundtrack by Zimmer and Junkie XL? Perfect, just perfect. When it comes to flaws, the film still has some of those. The Martha moment, while serving as a pivotal character moment for Batman, felt off in execution, and its understandable that many people got mad at it. If your main complaint about BvS the first time around was its bleak tone and subject matter, this film is still not for you. I understand most were expecting to see the heroes being the most iconic versions of themselves, clashing in an elongated battle and evoking the same feelings The Avengers gave audiences back in 2012. In that sense, the film will remain divisive, but at least I have the comfort of saying that, at the very least, the film is competently made."

"This film was amazing. Ben Affleck was easily the best part of this movie, he brought his a-game as Batman. The chemistry between Affleck & Irons was outstanding. Gal Gadot did a great job as Wonder Woman. The fight between Batman & Superman was awesome. The final fight with Doomsday was outstanding in every way possible. However, there is only one problem with this film and that's Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor. He was sadly missed cast in this role, but then again it's really the fault of Warner Bros. Studios. Overall, this film deliver on almost every level. I highly recommend that you watch the extended version of this film."

"I know I know. I saw it in theaters too, and felt like it could've been so much better. While the Batman element was good, the narrative felt fractured, and the third act was just one long stunt scene. Superman was relegated to a supporting character, and other characters didn't get a chance to shine. And then I chanced on the ultimate cut. Calling it 30 mins of \"extra\" footage is unfair to Zack Snyder because it's exactly these 30 mins that makes the movie a worthy one. What I can say about the theatrical cut is this - It had the blockbuster elements - music, visuals, stunts, CGI. But, it lacked the human elements. The first 20 mins of the movie had it, but not after that. The extended cut in comparison has a flow to the narrative. There are no disjointed scenes, everything flows smoothly, and there's connective tissue. Superman gets to spend some time with his father, and mother. Clark Kent does some investigative journalism. Superman helps the people after the blast. Lois Lane doesn't jump to conclusions, she gets to the bottom of the crime. Lex Luthor apparently had a coherent plan - everything is explained pretty well. Wonder Woman was already good, so there's no change there :) Also, the \"Martha\" scene seems better executed, because it is a few seconds longer, and there's time to breathe it in. So, here's my take on this movie - The theatrical cut was junk. Get the Bluray for ultimate edition, and you shall not be disappointed. I've seen it so many more times now, and it's the definitive cut. It is the movie we deserve. It's a unique take on Batman, and Superman. It's a gritty take on the superhero movie genre, and definitely the best DCEU movie, and the best DC movie since The Dark Knight.P.S. Yes it's dark. We're adults, and we should appreciate mature film making without intentionally silly moments. It attempts to be philosophical, and something deep instead of just trying to make you chuckle."

"This is one of the best superhero movies ever made. Zack Snyder is a magician behind the camera.The reason behind so many complaints is the fact that Warner Bros. marketed this movie as a fight between Batman and Superman. That's not what it is. It's a movie about the origins of the Justice League.The cinematography, the acting and the score are all second to none. This film is phenomenal.P.S: watch the 3 hour extended cut that Snyder intended you to see, not the 2 and a half hour movie that Warner Bros. decided would be better for theaters."

"I don't care what the critics say, this is a very well-done movie. I'll start my review by listing what I like about the movie.1.) Ben Affleck is the best batman to me and it is not close. He pulls off the role of an aging batman extremely well. Also, Zack Snyder's vision of batman is legit. I have always hated batman up until this adaptation of him. Instead of being a conflicted and idealistic batman, this batman is dark, gritty, and 100% a badass. His equipment is decked out with machine guns and he has no aversion to killing people. In fact, he probably kills about 50 criminal by the time this movie is over. The warehouse scene is the coolest batman scene in any movie.2.) The development of a grudge between batman and superman is pulled off flawlessly. It actually makes sense why batman dislikes superman. Then, when they do fight it is about the coolest thing you can expect to see from a superhero film. 3.) I disagree with a lot of people about Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor. In my opinion, he played his role to perfection. 4.) B v S sets up Wonder Woman and Justice League with Gal Gadot's cameo as Wonder Woman and short clips of Aquaman, the Flash, and Cyborg. B v S is one of my favorite superhero films and rewatching it never gets old."

"The theatrical cut of this film is garbage which is why I rated it eight stars instead of nine. The first time I watched this film I didn't like it (not straight out hate but didn't like). Character motivations didn't make any sense, Lex was annoying as s***, editing was sloppy, and it was overly dark and broody for an action superhero movie. A year + a half, five Marvel films, a ton of bad reviews and a Justice League later a thought popped into my head: \"what if I watched BVS again\". This time I didn't have trailers ruining the best moments, I only vaguely remembered the film, and I was conditioned to look at it negatively but something unexpected happened: I actually loved it. Superman was just a normal person that tried to make a difference cause he could that others imposed their own beliefs on. Lex Luthor was a genius that couldn't stand his powerlessness compared to Superman or more accurately a super being. As Alfred said \"The fever, the rage, the feeling of powerlessness that turns good men... cruel\" and you see the same thought process in Batman. Batman, just like Lex Luthor feels powerless in the midst of a god-being and just like Lex he attempts to destroy him so he can get his sense of power back but unlike Lex, Batman learns something. I what is one of the corniest lines of the movie Superman says, \"Martha\" when he knows he can't win against Batman in a late desperate attempt to save his mother. Not only does this name connect with Bruce Wayne but it also shows what really matters to a man of steel: it isn't power, it isn't fame or anything else, it is his Mother and on a broader scale it is people. Lex (who doesn't care about people at all) knows he doesn't have the power so he creates something from his blood and the remains of Zod: A Doomsday for Superman. Not only does this film have depth but it also doesn't always explain it to you which is rare in a blockbuster action superhero flick normally cater to semi-comic book fans and people that want to shove popcorn in their mouths. This film rewards you for really noticing the details while still having massive explosions. One of my favorites is how Lex has all of Batman's branded killed which is why he isn't afraid of the branding at the end or Grandma's Peach Tea as a way of scaring the s*** out of someone. Of course, this film isn't perfect and I do have personal dislikes. The Batman V Superman fight was slow and pretty boring especially after watching such an amazing fight in Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 2 (If you haven't watched the animated Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 1 and 2 you are sorely missing out on something fantastic). Also, the addition of Wonder Woman who pretty much steals a hacker thing, gives it back and then suits up and fights against a giant monster thing. Not to say I don't like Wonder Woman (She is one of my favorite Superheroes of all time who showed not only can woman kick a** but they also don't need to be ashamed of their sexuality or gender) but she wasn't really that helpful to the plot and just brought in to expand the universe which was well done through Lex's superhuman hunting files. Also, the post-apocalyptic scene that was just a dream could have been cut but nothing is perfect except movies like Citizen Kane which isn't a lot of fun to watch cause it is too perfect. So to summarize, the theatrical cut is bad, the ultimate cut is Amazing and the other cut is meh. Please give it a second chance because it deserves it and save a good director from losing grace because of something he didn't do."
"I really liked it, don't know what all the hate is about. I'm actually a Marvel fan from when I was 7 or so, but Superman and Batman together in 1 movie? Just great. And personally I like Ben Affleck even better than Christian Bale as Batman. So just watch and enjoy, I know I did!"

"That's right. We have been waiting for these two heroes to finally meet and fight against each other. This movie is so good in both plot and special effects.Henry Cavill and Ben Affleck have performed well in their acting stages. They are the best superhero actors and they have filmed their fighting scenes very well. The movie starts to show the conflict between the lives of the heroes and now they have blamed each other for it. This movie is amazing and sets up a good plot for Dawn Justice."

"Actually...I didn't know what to expect. When you see Wonder Woman, you know it will be off of Wonder Woman and off of a Wonder Woman story, but with Batman V Superman, I was like, \"hmmmm, so who is this about?\" It was pretty obvious that it would feature many characters, but I thought the introduction to Batman was amazing. Ben Affleck nailed the part, not only as Batman but also as Bruce Wayne. He is my Batman. Henry Cavill continued to be super as the Man of Steel. And he is my Super - Man. A dark story? Yes, without a doubt. Could it have had a few more jokes? Sure. But not all movies or stories need to have jokes when certain events are serious. I really hope people can see this review and take another look at the movie, because, I loved it. I really hope the ratings can go up, eventually. And P.S, this movie is the perfect set up to Justice League."

"I'll start by making it clear I have only ever seen the Ultimate Edition. I'm aware of what was cut out for the theatrical release, so I will concede up front that most of the criticisms about pacing, editing, and missing bits of plot at release were merited.With that caveat out of the way, I must reiterate that this was bar-none the boldest superhero movie I have ever seen. To me, it was arguably the best as well, though \"best\" shouldn't be taken to mean \"most enjoyable.\" That honor easily goes to \"Thor: Ragnarok.\" What makes BvS stand out among other films in the genre is that it takes two characters who have been done to death since the 1970s and brings them up to date. I recently tried to watch \"Superman: The Movie\" for the first time in a number of years, and while it was still good and Reeves will always be iconic, I just couldn't take it seriously. I'll put it this way: If the story in BvS was \"stupid\" in your view but Superman turning back time by spinning the earth backward on its axis didn't seem like one of the dumbest things you have ever seen -in any movie from any genre- to the extent that it outright ruins the movie for you, then your opinion about BvS isn't worth much. Nostalgic bias was always going to be a problem for this movie, and the way people reacted to and reviewed \"Man of Steel\" was telling in this regard.That brings me to Zack Snyder's take on Superman. You know, that guy whose status as the first extraterrestrial ever encountered by humanity was a total non-issue in the old movies. Apparently, Snyder has a similar view to my own in that his take on the Man of Steel makes his being an alien a core piece of his identity. He may look like any other (absurdly attractive) person, but he knows what he is, and that makes him perpetually uncertain of where he fits in this world. He is essentially good and really does care about people, but he struggles to truly empathize with the likes of us. To be human is to be frail, and that is not something he can easily relate to. This is the root of his conflict with Batman.Just as Clark struggles to genuinely relate to most people, Snyder's Batman either refuses to or otherwise just can't relate to Superman. He doesn't see him as anything but a threat regardless of Superman's clear good intentions. Remember, a small group of Kryptonians were able to bring humanity to the brink of extinction in less than a day, and Bruce Wayne is nothing if not a realist. He didn't know the guy from Kansas. He only knew the god from another world.While Batman's anger toward and fear of Superman are readily apparent from the start, Superman's inability to imagine things from Bruce Wayne's perspective only becomes truly apparent during their first real interaction. This reminded me of the animated version of the \"world's finest\" storyline, where Superman judges Batman harshly for using fear tactics and threats of violence (also, actual violence) to get the job done. Superman wasn't willing to consider what it would take for a human man to fight criminals and save innocents, or what that life would do to him over time. Just as Batman didn't see the guy from Kansas, Superman didn't see the man who lives his life trapped in one brutal, unthinkably traumatic moment (this was beautifully conveyed during the film's opening moments), and had spent his whole adult life bearing witness to humanity at its absolute worst.The conflict between these two characters is as old as human history. They want the same things, but they can't understand one another. So they fight. And what a fight it was.Watching a fight between, say, Captain America and Iron Man was, to me, more frustrating than anything because each understood the other's perspective perfectly. The fight between Batman and Superman in BvS was genuinely gut-wrenching, as intended, because they would have understood one another if either had tried. The whole sequence hilighted Batman's tactical prowess and ability to control a situation. Maybe the most badass thing about the fight was that it ended exactly where Batman planned. That brings me to the big elephant in the room named \"Martha.\"I can't recall exactly which YouTuber put it this way, but if you thought the \"save Martha\" exchange was about their mothers having the same name, you had your brain turned off. The brain-on people have explained this to death, but it bears repeating. This was the moment when Superman became humanized to Batman. He was about to die, and his only concern was for his adoptive human mother. He still believed that the man about to take his life would do the right thing. Even with the cowl on, there was no mistaking the look on Batman's face. It was the look of shame, guilt, and sudden uncertainty that says \"What am I doing?\" Turns out even the most brutal, angry version of Bruce Wayne is better than Tony Stark at knowing right from wrong. At knowing that he had gone too far.From there, the third act was a series of truly impressive (albeit mostly CGI) fight sequences, beginning with what I regard as the undisputed champion of Batman fights. Nothing in the Nolan movies (and especially nothing in the Burton movies) even came close. Go ahead, try to convince yourself that Batman and Bane taking turns punching one another in the face until Bane's mask broke was a good fight sequence. No, this was a fight straight out of \"Arkham Knight,\" and it was glorious. The battle against Doomsday really was one for the books. From the moment Wonder Woman arrived accompanied by the intense sounds of Tina Guo's electric cello to Superman's tragic, heroic death at the hands of Doomsday, I was glued to the screen. Sure, the mere presence of Doomsday spoiled the end to a degree, but watching the Man of Steel laboring to carry that kryptonite spear towards certain death was no less impactful. A brief word on Jesse Eisenberg's take on Lex Luthor. At least one other reviewer on this site already said it best when they pointed out that this was his origin story. If you consider his scheme objectively, he is actually one of the more formidable incarnations of the character. If we're lucky, we'll eventually get to see a Snyder Cut of \"Justice League\" and find out where this story was actually meant to go. For the record, Joss Whedon and Danny Elfman both should have said \"no\" to taking a dump on someone else's art."
"BATMAN V SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE brings a fantastic surprise to a smash-hit team-up with one of the worlds most beloved DC Comics' icons of all time. The movie delivers spectacular casting, and fantastic acting with different characters having their shine in each scenes.The story follows Clark Kent/Superman who becomes a threat, after the destruction in Metropolis in Man Of Steel.(2013). Batman/Bruce Wayne sees him as a threat and begins his war on Superman.The movie brings spectacular storytelling, it tells the complications of human against alien who are on the same side, and the first meeting of Batman and Superman. The story of Bruce Wayne, with his many years of The Caped Crusader, sends him on a spiral of \"out of control\", sheer anger, and builds tension to wanting to defeat the Man of Steel. Snyder has fantastically gave this storytelling an exciting nod to the comics.Lex Luthor, played by Jesse Einsberg, delivers a very interesting performance, but very differently by him showing is his \"origin\" before he becomes a bald foe to the Man of Steel. He shows that his love of \"god vs man\" terrorises mankind when he ultimately creates Doomsday, and Batman realises Superman's inner heroism.It packs so many great \"out of nowhere\" excitement, including a first-look of the fearful Wonder Woman a.k.a. Diana Prince, played by Gal Gadot, and a fresh-new glimpse of the superhero DC canon: The Justice League.WATCH THIS MOVIE! The critics are out of their mind. It's a fun-packed action adventure which still keeps the movie enjoyable until it's final minutes of the movie. It's a FANTASTIC MOVIE! BEN AFFLECK AS BATMAN... is Incredible!A 10/10 overall!"
"I want to go on record as saying that this is a truly thrilling cinematic experience in so many ways. If pressed, I guess I could acknowledge that there were a couple ... let's say \"clumsy\" moments. And in a film that runs to three hours, that hardly seems like a significant issue, certainly not enough to rate it with fewer than 9 stars.This film has everything. There is dramatic tension right from the start. There is a magnificent story arc that picks up quite seamlessly from 'Man of Steel' and propels the viewer not only into the life of Clark Kent/Superman but also of Bruce Wayne/Batman.The villain is no mere cartoon of a villain; he is truly thoroughly (and apparently irrevocably) diabolical. He is a psychopath, and you wish for his death over and over and over. You want Superman to reduce him to ash with the power of his eyes.I have read a number of viewers' reviews, and it seems that the people who disliked the film / gave it a low rating had rather unfair and unrealistic expectations of it. That is, their own prejudices about how the plot could/should unfold or what the character development could/should be, etc. ruined the film for them. And that is a shame.My thought is: I settle into my seat, wait for the lights to dim, and then I wait to be transported by the film. I accept it, lock, stock, and barrel.As another reviewer remarked, I love how the film begins from the point of view of Bruce Wayne as he is among people on the ground who have fallen victim to the attack of Zod and the other Kryptonians.Why would Bruce Wayne not like Superman? Why would the good people of Earth hurl insults at Superman and burn him in effigy (on the news)? Because the good people of Earth just got catapulted into a new reality in which there are not only extraterrestrial beings (surprise!) but they are also superman! And a group of them are hell-bent on destroying humankind and taking the planet for themselves.It is difficult to see Superman as separate from the whole Kryptonian Krew.It seems that many moviegoers forgot that Bruce Wayne is also human. Sure, he's a hero, but he is flawed.. Just like the rest of us. He is a vigilante, after all.He has let his vigilantism get the better of him. HE is actually the one working outside the boundaries of the law, not Superman. It is the clear head of Alfred that shows us that he has gone into a rather dark place, that he has not seen what is really going on (in Luthor's scheme), and so he chooses to embark on his own scheme scheme to take out the alien invader. He is (allegedly) thinking of the future: if he wipes out the all-powerful alien, then it can't turn on humankind in the future. At least, he convinces himself of that.A philosophical question is raised in the film: should Clark Kent have remained a simple man from Kansas and never have become the Superman? Should he just let people die and let calamities happen? The question is answered for us in the character of Diana Prince/Wonder Woman. She withdrew from mankind (her exact words) and just sat around watching. Watching while people died horrible deaths all around her. So, should Superman have done the same? Do these special beings, these 'metahumans', have some kind of moral imperative to intervene, or should they be allowed to be regular people, too? It seems that humans want it both ways.It seems that humans are saying: \"Don't be a superalien ... except when I and my friends and family are in trouble. Then come save us.\""

"Batman v Superman: Ultimate Edition: If your looking for a quick, cheap thrill then you might not enjoy this film at the time. This movies theatrical version was butchered by WB and in doing so reshaped the story leaving numerous plot holes. So the Ultimate Edition is the full story and the one worth seeing. Watch 'Man of Steel' before seeing this movie. There is much to claw through here, so much so that the audience might easily find themselves exhausted from the overall aggression of the film. However, a lot of the story does work. The action is good, and the emotion feels real most of the time.This film is about Superman trying to become Superman. Trying to help the world, save people, find a place in this world not as an outcast, and yet is looked at has a threat by many. Superman is not from this world, yet He is trying to be human, find a place in this world, be excepted by earths people, and come into his destiny.This film is also about Batman being Batman for 20 years and losing faith in humanity, and fearing Superman, what Superman can do with his powers. Great film, great plot, great visuals. ---Yidioo"
"I didn't see the film in the theaters and just bought the \"Extended Edition \" on Amazon. I never properly saw Man of Steel- i think I rented it and watched it when already exhausted and fell asleep. I saw the mediocre user reviews and horrible reviews from critics of this film.They really have it wrong. This is the very best either Batman or Superman. It has a different take, on things. Much darker then earlier films even darker then the Christopher Nolan Batman films.First of all Christopher Nolan is an Executive Producer. So how bad could it be? I loved Sucker Punch and Zack Snyder was involved with that. So how bad could this be? Hans Zimmer did the music, so how bad could it be?I remember watching the old Superman TV shows and reading the Superman and Batman comics as a little kid and loved them, but i wouldn't call myself a \"fan boy\" of comic universes, like so many younger people today. As an older adult I will admit my favorite TV show of all time was Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but watched it on DVD only after it had finished. I saw the second of the Dark Knight series in the theater, but the other two, I watched on DVD. They were great, but not my favorite films like so many people. i also loved the first couple Superman and Batman films in the older series. Regardless, i was not waiting with baited breath to see Man of Steel or this one.I'm more of a serious film fan, who can watch Stanley Kubrick films over and over and my favorite films in the last twenty years, are Eyes Wide Shut and Intersteller, both of which i've watched multiple times.So, with that said, take it from me, the critics have this film very wrong, just as critics hated 2001: A Space Odyssey when it first came out. This film will have lasting appreciation.Surprised how much I liked Ben Afleck's Batman. it was hard to get into Henry Cavil's scrawnier looking Superman, but it grew on me. Amy Adams was great as Lois Lane, The Gal Gadol Wonder Women was amazing. Lex Luther was terrific, like Nolan's Joker. Jeremy Irons was the best Alfred ever. Holly Hunter and Diane Lane was good too. The movie had bad reviews but made a billion dollars. Hopefully everyone buys the Ultimate Edition and it breaks sales records and the film is re-appreciated. I have no idea what scenes this Ultimate Edition added, but it is pretty perfect. Now I can't wait for Wonder Woman and the Justice League and as soon as I finish writing this am going to watch Man of Steal. I'm into it now!I can only surmise that the bad reviews stem from too much expectations of the rigid fan boy types and the radical changes in tone, we see in this film.Total masterpiece of cinema, but I have a few criticisms. There are a few hollow scenes of typical Idiot cops and authorities getting everything wrong in a cliché type way and it has a few filler scenes of that type and a few moments here and there that felt rushed and cheesy. Maybe not everything restored into the Ultimate Edition should have been. I wish there had been more Kevin Costner scenes."

"The whole entire Batman V Superman movie was great and yes even though it felt slow to the majority of the people who watched it but to me I enjoyed every part and every scene of Batman V Superman and when it got to the fight scenes both batman VS Superman and the Doomsday fight it brought so much drama, intensity, and epic performances. So with that being said I give this movie a good 10/10 because it really did go to my expectations and it brought a powerful performance and a powerful yet epic introduction to the upcoming Justice League."

"Zack Snyder not only understands the characters but he also understands how to craft a real amazing movie for fans - honestly blew me away (extended cut) Brilliant!Don't believe what the internet is telling you to think - take this from a person who has worked in the comic book industry - this is amazing!"

"When I first wrote a review for this movie a year ago exclaiming my excitement for the film, I had been high off a fresh dose of live-action DC superheroes playing out the beloved comic book stories that I had grown up on. It was all playing out before my eyes and coming to life. After a few months had passed, I began to notice things about the movie that I disliked: little gaps in the story, things that didn't add up, etc. My original rating of a 10 / 10 dropped to an 8 /10. But today it has gone back up to a 10. The extended version of the film not only rectifies the gaps but also silences critics.Many claimed that the movie was too dark or that it just didn't make sense. To those people, I say: \"Pick up a comic book!\" Many of the critics of this particular film were part of the superhero bandwagon that formed when Marvel began its spree of Avengers-related films. In fact, its estimated that over 60% of people who go to see 'superhero' genre films have never picked up a comic book in their life. I would argue that similar numbers could figure to those which view the CW televised DC Universe shows. People complain that DC comics is just too dark but the fact is that these movies are based upon actual comics which are meant to be dark (ex: The Dark Knight Returns, Injustice, etc.). Its like complaining that Game of Thrones (the TV series) sucks because they kill off too many characters. Read the books! Its frustrating to see such a beautiful work of art like Batman V Superman criticized by those ignorant to its universe and its meaning. This movie is in fact a catalyst that opens numerous doorways and leaves true fans in awe of the possibilities for future movies. But regardless of whether or not people choose to educate themselves, this film's DVD/Blu-ray extended version puts the theater release to shame. All of the plot holes and gaps are filled in 30 minutes of extended footage scattered throughout the film. The movie ultimately becomes more complete and people will wish that the movie had shown the full 3 hours of footage in its theatrical debut. As a major DC comics fan, I will of course pick up on things that a comics fan would not, but someone who does not read comics would learn to appreciate this film in its entirety with the extended version. Get your hands on a copy today or find it on Netflix or the internet somewhere!"

"I ignored the bad reviews and watched anyways. This film had a lot to live up to after Civil War was released and I went into this film expecting the worst. It ended up to be the best Superhero film of 2016 to me. One complaint was that this film was more concerned about universe building than telling a great story than Civil War but for me it was the other way around; Civil War felt like a build up to something else and to be honest, I felt that way when I saw the other MCU films. Batman vs Superman however not only had a great story, but it also felt a lot more consistent than Civil War. This film was way more diverse with the cast than the MCU but unlike the MCU, I felt like this film doesn't go overboard with the SJW stuff like the MCU films or The Star Wars Sequel films do. The Visuals were AMAZING, The Score by Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL was AMAZING as well, The Tone is just right as I actually felt for the characters emotionally, The Cinematography kept my eyes glued to the screen, and the script felt really Intelligent and Complex and despite people calling the writing confusing, I was able to piece it together with no problem whatsoever. This film is similar to Empire Strikes back in terms of popularity so over time after the other movies are released, this movie would probably be more popular.This film was way better than I Expected and deserves another chance.

"Its shame to see what critics and marvel fans did to this movie and targeted Zack Snyder for it. I have seen this movie more than 25 times till date. And i enjoy this movie as much as i enjoyed the first time. The fans who have read DC comics, wouldn't be disappointed in this movie. Its dark movie, yes it is. Because the title shows the intense situation at hand. Two superheroes about to rip each other apart for whatever reasons that brought them to this stage. Yes it had to be dark and intense.Only marvel can be stupid enough to show an alien invasion where humans are loosing the battle and the super heroes are cracking jokes while battles as if they are playing ping pong. a person playing Call of Duty game is more serious while playing than the marvel heroes fighting aliens."

"Last week some news came out from somebody online who had claimed to have seen a finished version of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. If you were like me, you've been leery of checking it out because you weren't sure how much might actually be true. Now Zack Snyder has spoken out about the spoiler-filled post, although his response doesn't really clear anything up.In a word, to MTV, he called the post \"hilarious,which might imply that he's saying that it's mostly, if not entirely, untrue. That might be the case, but then again he could have just said it was untrue and he didn't say that. What he did say, however, is that he doesn't like spoilers. While this may seem odd for the director who's most recent trailer appeared to give away the entire movie, Snyder says that's not the case. Even if you've seen the trailer, you can rest easy, as there is much more we have not seen in then finished film. Says Snyder I have the benefit of seeing the movie. It's cool that think it's too much, and I appreciate people not wanting to know, but there's plenty that they don't know. There's a lot of movie that's not in the trailer. In the process of calling the Batman v Superman Reddit review hilarious, Snyder goes on to talk about how he hates it when spoilers come out. The director would much rather that fans see the movie mostly blind. While he understands that some fans may wish to find the answers before hand, he wants his movies to be mysteries going in. If you're, as an audience member, exploring these articles, looking for answers to questions that you have, maybe you're okay with knowing before you go. It's like an individual taste. But like I said, I want people to see the movie without knowing.Spoilers are a topic that mean different things to different people. While most try to avoid them to some degree, the need to solve the mystery is a nearly universal human experience. We have an inclination to want to know the truth, even while also wanting to be surprised. For most of us getting some information is good, but getting all the information is bad, of course, only getting the details that you want can be difficult."
"The theatrical is choppy, poorly edited, hard to follow, with some really good moments mixed in their. The extended is much more fluent and is much easier to follow, it does have a long runtime, which might make it seem a bit dragging on, but if you like long films done right, like Lord of the Rings, you will like this movie as long as you get into the characters and story. Speaking of which, the story starts out perfectly showing Bruce Wayne as a character, and it is very powerful. There are several moments in this movie that are powerful, emotional, and shocking. Characters. Batman is my favorite fictional character of all time, and believe me when I say, Ben Affleck as Batman was perfect, he had the charisma, the anger, and the look of being through some bad stuff Gal Gadot also does perfect as Wonder Woman, but if you want to really see how good she does, go watch the Wonder Woman movie. Henry Call as Superman. I really don't like it when people say Christopher Reeves is better. Don't get me wrong, Reeves does great, but can you imagine him as Superman in this movie? I wouldn't like it. It would be like Adam West playing Batman in The Dark Knight. Henry Cavill does great in this role, I can say everything about him as I said with Ben Affleck. Jesse Eisenberg as Luthor. I thought it was different in a good way. I've heard a criticism for him as being too much like Joker, but is that a bad thing? Joker is my favorite villain, so to see Superman have an enemy that crazy, but still hold the values Luthor needs to be Luthor, I think it is great. The thing I thought this movie was lacking in the first and second acts was humor, at least good humor. If there was more humor, I would've given this movie a ten because it would give a more relaxing feel to the parts that needed it. All in all though, this movie was awesome, it had powerful moments, it was badass, and just plain fun. It had a great story arc and does its job very well."

"*I will be talking about the Ultimate Edition of the film* This was one of the most anticipated CBM of all time. Ever since the arrival and subsequent success of Marvel's The Avengers people have wondered when will DC launch its own cinematic universe, one of the main reasons being the opportunity to finally see titans such as Batman and Superman share the screen together: the ultimate nerd dream. On 2016, the moment finally came for BvS to be released AND.. it performed poorly. Not only did critical reception left a lot to be desired, but fan reactions where surprisingly split after its cinematic debut. People either loved it and called Zack a genius, or hated it and called him a hack. Me, personally, I found myself with middle of the road feelings, for sure, but more leaning towards the negative side with subsequent viewings. The theatrical cut of the film showcased amazing performances, incredible visuals, and action set pieces that seemed like comic book panels come to life, in a good way. However, when it comes to its narrative structure and more technical aspects like editing, the film was seriously flawed. More plot holes than Age of Ultron, questionable character decisions, random editing that lacked cohesion and focus, and forced dramatic moments that lacked any impact because the attempts at character development ranged from limited to nonexistent, especially when it comes to Superman's character. I thought it was a 5/10 movie at best. As such, I was kind of skeptical about the idea of a 30 minute longer version. I say kind of because I know how Zack works. I remember Watchmen being vastly improved with its director's cut, so in a way I was expecting BvS to perform in a similar manner, but I also feared those 30 minutes wold be just there to amplify action and discredit storytelling issues. Oh boy, I'm so glad I was proved wrong. The ultimate cut of the film was infuriating, but not because it was awful, but because it questions the sanity of WB executives and editors and makes you wonder what were they thinking during the editing process. What I got out of the Ultimate Edition was a thought-provoking deconstruction of two very iconic superheroes that gave spotlight to the struggles both of them face when they aren't fighting crime. What I got was an extremely well produced character study on both Batman and Superman in a cynical world, a world dangerously close to our own. We meet Batman as a ruthless, worn out hero that has seen the failure behind his ideals and witnessed some truly horrifying things in his life. Superman, on the other hand, is portrayed as a godlike figure that seeks to do good in the world, but finds himself emotionally conflicted once he realized that every good deed he does leaves behind a trail of destruction (most of it due to Luthor's antics). In my opinion, this is a hugely original approach, one that distances itself from the rest of the competition and delivers a dark, somber, yet relevant superhero movie that understands both characters and gives them real human struggles to deal with. I felt invested in both of them, and hoped that by the end of the film both could find a way to redeem themselves. Their character arcs were very well established during the first two acts of the movie, and by the time we get to the titular climactic battle the emotion behind the jaw-dropping action is intensified. Lex Luthor as a villain was also given more time to develop with this new edition. One of the main criticisms with the original version was the fact that his plan relied too much on conveniences, and the character's mannerisms and mad-scientist attitude was annoying, and that goes without saying his motivations were unclear. Not only do we spend more time understanding his hate for any godlike figure and thus his hatred for Superman, but the added scenes allowed us to witness his entire plan come to fruition. It sells the cold, manipulative, calculating attributes of his comic counterpart. The acting is spot on. Every actor owns his/her role, from Cavill's Superman, to Ben Affleck as Batman, Eisenberg as Luthor, and Gadot as Wonder Woman, whose scenes are brief, but are more than enough to sell the strong and ferocious warrior that she is. Cinematography is stunning, and miles above that of Man of Steel's. And the soundtrack by Zimmer and Junkie XL? Perfect, just perfect. When it comes to flaws, the film still has some of those. The Martha moment, while serving as a pivotal character moment for Batman, felt off in execution, and its understandable that many people got mad at it. If your main complaint about BvS the first time around was its bleak tone and subject matter, this film is still not for you. I understand most were expecting to see the heroes being the most iconic versions of themselves, clashing in an elongated battle and evoking the same feelings The Avengers gave audiences back in 2012. In that sense, the film will remain divisive, but at least I have the comfort of saying that, at the very least, the film is competently made."

"This film was amazing. Ben Affleck was easily the best part of this movie, he brought his a-game as Batman. The chemistry between Affleck & Irons was outstanding. Gal Gadot did a great job as Wonder Woman. The fight between Batman & Superman was awesome. The final fight with Doomsday was outstanding in every way possible. However, there is only one problem with this film and that's Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor. He was sadly missed cast in this role, but then again it's really the fault of Warner Bros. Studios. Overall, this film deliver on almost every level. I highly recommend that you watch the extended version of this film."

"I know I know. I saw it in theaters too, and felt like it could've been so much better. While the Batman element was good, the narrative felt fractured, and the third act was just one long stunt scene. Superman was relegated to a supporting character, and other characters didn't get a chance to shine. And then I chanced on the ultimate cut. Calling it 30 mins of \"extra\" footage is unfair to Zack Snyder because it's exactly these 30 mins that makes the movie a worthy one. What I can say about the theatrical cut is this - It had the blockbuster elements - music, visuals, stunts, CGI. But, it lacked the human elements. The first 20 mins of the movie had it, but not after that. The extended cut in comparison has a flow to the narrative. There are no disjointed scenes, everything flows smoothly, and there's connective tissue. Superman gets to spend some time with his father, and mother. Clark Kent does some investigative journalism. Superman helps the people after the blast. Lois Lane doesn't jump to conclusions, she gets to the bottom of the crime. Lex Luthor apparently had a coherent plan - everything is explained pretty well. Wonder Woman was already good, so there's no change there :) Also, the \"Martha\" scene seems better executed, because it is a few seconds longer, and there's time to breathe it in. So, here's my take on this movie - The theatrical cut was junk. Get the Bluray for ultimate edition, and you shall not be disappointed. I've seen it so many more times now, and it's the definitive cut. It is the movie we deserve. It's a unique take on Batman, and Superman. It's a gritty take on the superhero movie genre, and definitely the best DCEU movie, and the best DC movie since The Dark Knight.P.S. Yes it's dark. We're adults, and we should appreciate mature film making without intentionally silly moments. It attempts to be philosophical, and something deep instead of just trying to make you chuckle."

"This is one of the best superhero movies ever made. Zack Snyder is a magician behind the camera.The reason behind so many complaints is the fact that Warner Bros. marketed this movie as a fight between Batman and Superman. That's not what it is. It's a movie about the origins of the Justice League.The cinematography, the acting and the score are all second to none. This film is phenomenal.P.S: watch the 3 hour extended cut that Snyder intended you to see, not the 2 and a half hour movie that Warner Bros. decided would be better for theaters."

"I don't care what the critics say, this is a very well-done movie. I'll start my review by listing what I like about the movie.1.) Ben Affleck is the best batman to me and it is not close. He pulls off the role of an aging batman extremely well. Also, Zack Snyder's vision of batman is legit. I have always hated batman up until this adaptation of him. Instead of being a conflicted and idealistic batman, this batman is dark, gritty, and 100% a badass. His equipment is decked out with machine guns and he has no aversion to killing people. In fact, he probably kills about 50 criminal by the time this movie is over. The warehouse scene is the coolest batman scene in any movie.2.) The development of a grudge between batman and superman is pulled off flawlessly. It actually makes sense why batman dislikes superman. Then, when they do fight it is about the coolest thing you can expect to see from a superhero film. 3.) I disagree with a lot of people about Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor. In my opinion, he played his role to perfection. 4.) B v S sets up Wonder Woman and Justice League with Gal Gadot's cameo as Wonder Woman and short clips of Aquaman, the Flash, and Cyborg. B v S is one of my favorite superhero films and rewatching it never gets old."

"The theatrical cut of this film is garbage which is why I rated it eight stars instead of nine. The first time I watched this film I didn't like it (not straight out hate but didn't like). Character motivations didn't make any sense, Lex was annoying as s***, editing was sloppy, and it was overly dark and broody for an action superhero movie. A year + a half, five Marvel films, a ton of bad reviews and a Justice League later a thought popped into my head: \"what if I watched BVS again\". This time I didn't have trailers ruining the best moments, I only vaguely remembered the film, and I was conditioned to look at it negatively but something unexpected happened: I actually loved it. Superman was just a normal person that tried to make a difference cause he could that others imposed their own beliefs on. Lex Luthor was a genius that couldn't stand his powerlessness compared to Superman or more accurately a super being. As Alfred said \"The fever, the rage, the feeling of powerlessness that turns good men... cruel\" and you see the same thought process in Batman. Batman, just like Lex Luthor feels powerless in the midst of a god-being and just like Lex he attempts to destroy him so he can get his sense of power back but unlike Lex, Batman learns something. I what is one of the corniest lines of the movie Superman says, \"Martha\" when he knows he can't win against Batman in a late desperate attempt to save his mother. Not only does this name connect with Bruce Wayne but it also shows what really matters to a man of steel: it isn't power, it isn't fame or anything else, it is his Mother and on a broader scale it is people. Lex (who doesn't care about people at all) knows he doesn't have the power so he creates something from his blood and the remains of Zod: A Doomsday for Superman. Not only does this film have depth but it also doesn't always explain it to you which is rare in a blockbuster action superhero flick normally cater to semi-comic book fans and people that want to shove popcorn in their mouths. This film rewards you for really noticing the details while still having massive explosions. One of my favorites is how Lex has all of Batman's branded killed which is why he isn't afraid of the branding at the end or Grandma's Peach Tea as a way of scaring the s*** out of someone. Of course, this film isn't perfect and I do have personal dislikes. The Batman V Superman fight was slow and pretty boring especially after watching such an amazing fight in Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 2 (If you haven't watched the animated Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 1 and 2 you are sorely missing out on something fantastic). Also, the addition of Wonder Woman who pretty much steals a hacker thing, gives it back and then suits up and fights against a giant monster thing. Not to say I don't like Wonder Woman (She is one of my favorite Superheroes of all time who showed not only can woman kick a** but they also don't need to be ashamed of their sexuality or gender) but she wasn't really that helpful to the plot and just brought in to expand the universe which was well done through Lex's superhuman hunting files. Also, the post-apocalyptic scene that was just a dream could have been cut but nothing is perfect except movies like Citizen Kane which isn't a lot of fun to watch cause it is too perfect. So to summarize, the theatrical cut is bad, the ultimate cut is Amazing and the other cut is meh. Please give it a second chance because it deserves it and save a good director from losing grace because of something he didn't do."
"I really liked it, don't know what all the hate is about. I'm actually a Marvel fan from when I was 7 or so, but Superman and Batman together in 1 movie? Just great. And personally I like Ben Affleck even better than Christian Bale as Batman. So just watch and enjoy, I know I did!"

"That's right. We have been waiting for these two heroes to finally meet and fight against each other. This movie is so good in both plot and special effects.Henry Cavill and Ben Affleck have performed well in their acting stages. They are the best superhero actors and they have filmed their fighting scenes very well. The movie starts to show the conflict between the lives of the heroes and now they have blamed each other for it. This movie is amazing and sets up a good plot for Dawn Justice."

"Actually...I didn't know what to expect. When you see Wonder Woman, you know it will be off of Wonder Woman and off of a Wonder Woman story, but with Batman V Superman, I was like, \"hmmmm, so who is this about?\" It was pretty obvious that it would feature many characters, but I thought the introduction to Batman was amazing. Ben Affleck nailed the part, not only as Batman but also as Bruce Wayne. He is my Batman. Henry Cavill continued to be super as the Man of Steel. And he is my Super - Man. A dark story? Yes, without a doubt. Could it have had a few more jokes? Sure. But not all movies or stories need to have jokes when certain events are serious. I really hope people can see this review and take another look at the movie, because, I loved it. I really hope the ratings can go up, eventually. And P.S, this movie is the perfect set up to Justice League."

"I'll start by making it clear I have only ever seen the Ultimate Edition. I'm aware of what was cut out for the theatrical release, so I will concede up front that most of the criticisms about pacing, editing, and missing bits of plot at release were merited.With that caveat out of the way, I must reiterate that this was bar-none the boldest superhero movie I have ever seen. To me, it was arguably the best as well, though \"best\" shouldn't be taken to mean \"most enjoyable.\" That honor easily goes to \"Thor: Ragnarok.\" What makes BvS stand out among other films in the genre is that it takes two characters who have been done to death since the 1970s and brings them up to date. I recently tried to watch \"Superman: The Movie\" for the first time in a number of years, and while it was still good and Reeves will always be iconic, I just couldn't take it seriously. I'll put it this way: If the story in BvS was \"stupid\" in your view but Superman turning back time by spinning the earth backward on its axis didn't seem like one of the dumbest things you have ever seen -in any movie from any genre- to the extent that it outright ruins the movie for you, then your opinion about BvS isn't worth much. Nostalgic bias was always going to be a problem for this movie, and the way people reacted to and reviewed \"Man of Steel\" was telling in this regard.That brings me to Zack Snyder's take on Superman. You know, that guy whose status as the first extraterrestrial ever encountered by humanity was a total non-issue in the old movies. Apparently, Snyder has a similar view to my own in that his take on the Man of Steel makes his being an alien a core piece of his identity. He may look like any other (absurdly attractive) person, but he knows what he is, and that makes him perpetually uncertain of where he fits in this world. He is essentially good and really does care about people, but he struggles to truly empathize with the likes of us. To be human is to be frail, and that is not something he can easily relate to. This is the root of his conflict with Batman.Just as Clark struggles to genuinely relate to most people, Snyder's Batman either refuses to or otherwise just can't relate to Superman. He doesn't see him as anything but a threat regardless of Superman's clear good intentions. Remember, a small group of Kryptonians were able to bring humanity to the brink of extinction in less than a day, and Bruce Wayne is nothing if not a realist. He didn't know the guy from Kansas. He only knew the god from another world.While Batman's anger toward and fear of Superman are readily apparent from the start, Superman's inability to imagine things from Bruce Wayne's perspective only becomes truly apparent during their first real interaction. This reminded me of the animated version of the \"world's finest\" storyline, where Superman judges Batman harshly for using fear tactics and threats of violence (also, actual violence) to get the job done. Superman wasn't willing to consider what it would take for a human man to fight criminals and save innocents, or what that life would do to him over time. Just as Batman didn't see the guy from Kansas, Superman didn't see the man who lives his life trapped in one brutal, unthinkably traumatic moment (this was beautifully conveyed during the film's opening moments), and had spent his whole adult life bearing witness to humanity at its absolute worst.The conflict between these two characters is as old as human history. They want the same things, but they can't understand one another. So they fight. And what a fight it was.Watching a fight between, say, Captain America and Iron Man was, to me, more frustrating than anything because each understood the other's perspective perfectly. The fight between Batman and Superman in BvS was genuinely gut-wrenching, as intended, because they would have understood one another if either had tried. The whole sequence hilighted Batman's tactical prowess and ability to control a situation. Maybe the most badass thing about the fight was that it ended exactly where Batman planned. That brings me to the big elephant in the room named \"Martha.\"I can't recall exactly which YouTuber put it this way, but if you thought the \"save Martha\" exchange was about their mothers having the same name, you had your brain turned off. The brain-on people have explained this to death, but it bears repeating. This was the moment when Superman became humanized to Batman. He was about to die, and his only concern was for his adoptive human mother. He still believed that the man about to take his life would do the right thing. Even with the cowl on, there was no mistaking the look on Batman's face. It was the look of shame, guilt, and sudden uncertainty that says \"What am I doing?\" Turns out even the most brutal, angry version of Bruce Wayne is better than Tony Stark at knowing right from wrong. At knowing that he had gone too far.From there, the third act was a series of truly impressive (albeit mostly CGI) fight sequences, beginning with what I regard as the undisputed champion of Batman fights. Nothing in the Nolan movies (and especially nothing in the Burton movies) even came close. Go ahead, try to convince yourself that Batman and Bane taking turns punching one another in the face until Bane's mask broke was a good fight sequence. No, this was a fight straight out of \"Arkham Knight,\" and it was glorious. The battle against Doomsday really was one for the books. From the moment Wonder Woman arrived accompanied by the intense sounds of Tina Guo's electric cello to Superman's tragic, heroic death at the hands of Doomsday, I was glued to the screen. Sure, the mere presence of Doomsday spoiled the end to a degree, but watching the Man of Steel laboring to carry that kryptonite spear towards certain death was no less impactful. A brief word on Jesse Eisenberg's take on Lex Luthor. At least one other reviewer on this site already said it best when they pointed out that this was his origin story. If you consider his scheme objectively, he is actually one of the more formidable incarnations of the character. If we're lucky, we'll eventually get to see a Snyder Cut of \"Justice League\" and find out where this story was actually meant to go. For the record, Joss Whedon and Danny Elfman both should have said \"no\" to taking a dump on someone else's art."
"BATMAN V SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE brings a fantastic surprise to a smash-hit team-up with one of the worlds most beloved DC Comics' icons of all time. The movie delivers spectacular casting, and fantastic acting with different characters having their shine in each scenes.The story follows Clark Kent/Superman who becomes a threat, after the destruction in Metropolis in Man Of Steel.(2013). Batman/Bruce Wayne sees him as a threat and begins his war on Superman.The movie brings spectacular storytelling, it tells the complications of human against alien who are on the same side, and the first meeting of Batman and Superman. The story of Bruce Wayne, with his many years of The Caped Crusader, sends him on a spiral of \"out of control\", sheer anger, and builds tension to wanting to defeat the Man of Steel. Snyder has fantastically gave this storytelling an exciting nod to the comics.Lex Luthor, played by Jesse Einsberg, delivers a very interesting performance, but very differently by him showing is his \"origin\" before he becomes a bald foe to the Man of Steel. He shows that his love of \"god vs man\" terrorises mankind when he ultimately creates Doomsday, and Batman realises Superman's inner heroism.It packs so many great \"out of nowhere\" excitement, including a first-look of the fearful Wonder Woman a.k.a. Diana Prince, played by Gal Gadot, and a fresh-new glimpse of the superhero DC canon: The Justice League.WATCH THIS MOVIE! The critics are out of their mind. It's a fun-packed action adventure which still keeps the movie enjoyable until it's final minutes of the movie. It's a FANTASTIC MOVIE! BEN AFFLECK AS BATMAN... is Incredible!A 10/10 overall!"
"I want to go on record as saying that this is a truly thrilling cinematic experience in so many ways. If pressed, I guess I could acknowledge that there were a couple ... let's say \"clumsy\" moments. And in a film that runs to three hours, that hardly seems like a significant issue, certainly not enough to rate it with fewer than 9 stars.This film has everything. There is dramatic tension right from the start. There is a magnificent story arc that picks up quite seamlessly from 'Man of Steel' and propels the viewer not only into the life of Clark Kent/Superman but also of Bruce Wayne/Batman.The villain is no mere cartoon of a villain; he is truly thoroughly (and apparently irrevocably) diabolical. He is a psychopath, and you wish for his death over and over and over. You want Superman to reduce him to ash with the power of his eyes.I have read a number of viewers' reviews, and it seems that the people who disliked the film / gave it a low rating had rather unfair and unrealistic expectations of it. That is, their own prejudices about how the plot could/should unfold or what the character development could/should be, etc. ruined the film for them. And that is a shame.My thought is: I settle into my seat, wait for the lights to dim, and then I wait to be transported by the film. I accept it, lock, stock, and barrel.As another reviewer remarked, I love how the film begins from the point of view of Bruce Wayne as he is among people on the ground who have fallen victim to the attack of Zod and the other Kryptonians.Why would Bruce Wayne not like Superman? Why would the good people of Earth hurl insults at Superman and burn him in effigy (on the news)? Because the good people of Earth just got catapulted into a new reality in which there are not only extraterrestrial beings (surprise!) but they are also superman! And a group of them are hell-bent on destroying humankind and taking the planet for themselves.It is difficult to see Superman as separate from the whole Kryptonian Krew.It seems that many moviegoers forgot that Bruce Wayne is also human. Sure, he's a hero, but he is flawed.. Just like the rest of us. He is a vigilante, after all.He has let his vigilantism get the better of him. HE is actually the one working outside the boundaries of the law, not Superman. It is the clear head of Alfred that shows us that he has gone into a rather dark place, that he has not seen what is really going on (in Luthor's scheme), and so he chooses to embark on his own scheme scheme to take out the alien invader. He is (allegedly) thinking of the future: if he wipes out the all-powerful alien, then it can't turn on humankind in the future. At least, he convinces himself of that.A philosophical question is raised in the film: should Clark Kent have remained a simple man from Kansas and never have become the Superman? Should he just let people die and let calamities happen? The question is answered for us in the character of Diana Prince/Wonder Woman. She withdrew from mankind (her exact words) and just sat around watching. Watching while people died horrible deaths all around her. So, should Superman have done the same? Do these special beings, these 'metahumans', have some kind of moral imperative to intervene, or should they be allowed to be regular people, too? It seems that humans want it both ways.It seems that humans are saying: \"Don't be a superalien ... except when I and my friends and family are in trouble. Then come save us.\""

"Batman v Superman: Ultimate Edition: If your looking for a quick, cheap thrill then you might not enjoy this film at the time. This movies theatrical version was butchered by WB and in doing so reshaped the story leaving numerous plot holes. So the Ultimate Edition is the full story and the one worth seeing. Watch 'Man of Steel' before seeing this movie. There is much to claw through here, so much so that the audience might easily find themselves exhausted from the overall aggression of the film. However, a lot of the story does work. The action is good, and the emotion feels real most of the time.This film is about Superman trying to become Superman. Trying to help the world, save people, find a place in this world not as an outcast, and yet is looked at has a threat by many. Superman is not from this world, yet He is trying to be human, find a place in this world, be excepted by earths people, and come into his destiny.This film is also about Batman being Batman for 20 years and losing faith in humanity, and fearing Superman, what Superman can do with his powers. Great film, great plot, great visuals. ---Yidioo"
"I didn't see the film in the theaters and just bought the \"Extended Edition \" on Amazon. I never properly saw Man of Steel- i think I rented it and watched it when already exhausted and fell asleep. I saw the mediocre user reviews and horrible reviews from critics of this film.They really have it wrong. This is the very best either Batman or Superman. It has a different take, on things. Much darker then earlier films even darker then the Christopher Nolan Batman films.First of all Christopher Nolan is an Executive Producer. So how bad could it be? I loved Sucker Punch and Zack Snyder was involved with that. So how bad could this be? Hans Zimmer did the music, so how bad could it be?I remember watching the old Superman TV shows and reading the Superman and Batman comics as a little kid and loved them, but i wouldn't call myself a \"fan boy\" of comic universes, like so many younger people today. As an older adult I will admit my favorite TV show of all time was Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but watched it on DVD only after it had finished. I saw the second of the Dark Knight series in the theater, but the other two, I watched on DVD. They were great, but not my favorite films like so many people. i also loved the first couple Superman and Batman films in the older series. Regardless, i was not waiting with baited breath to see Man of Steel or this one.I'm more of a serious film fan, who can watch Stanley Kubrick films over and over and my favorite films in the last twenty years, are Eyes Wide Shut and Intersteller, both of which i've watched multiple times.So, with that said, take it from me, the critics have this film very wrong, just as critics hated 2001: A Space Odyssey when it first came out. This film will have lasting appreciation.Surprised how much I liked Ben Afleck's Batman. it was hard to get into Henry Cavil's scrawnier looking Superman, but it grew on me. Amy Adams was great as Lois Lane, The Gal Gadol Wonder Women was amazing. Lex Luther was terrific, like Nolan's Joker. Jeremy Irons was the best Alfred ever. Holly Hunter and Diane Lane was good too. The movie had bad reviews but made a billion dollars. Hopefully everyone buys the Ultimate Edition and it breaks sales records and the film is re-appreciated. I have no idea what scenes this Ultimate Edition added, but it is pretty perfect. Now I can't wait for Wonder Woman and the Justice League and as soon as I finish writing this am going to watch Man of Steal. I'm into it now!I can only surmise that the bad reviews stem from too much expectations of the rigid fan boy types and the radical changes in tone, we see in this film.Total masterpiece of cinema, but I have a few criticisms. There are a few hollow scenes of typical Idiot cops and authorities getting everything wrong in a cliché type way and it has a few filler scenes of that type and a few moments here and there that felt rushed and cheesy. Maybe not everything restored into the Ultimate Edition should have been. I wish there had been more Kevin Costner scenes."

"The whole entire Batman V Superman movie was great and yes even though it felt slow to the majority of the people who watched it but to me I enjoyed every part and every scene of Batman V Superman and when it got to the fight scenes both batman VS Superman and the Doomsday fight it brought so much drama, intensity, and epic performances. So with that being said I give this movie a good 10/10 because it really did go to my expectations and it brought a powerful performance and a powerful yet epic introduction to the upcoming Justice League."

"When I first wrote a review for this movie a year ago exclaiming my excitement for the film, I had been high off a fresh dose of live-action DC superheroes playing out the beloved comic book stories that I had grown up on. It was all playing out before my eyes and coming to life. After a few months had passed, I began to notice things about the movie that I disliked: little gaps in the story, things that didn't add up, etc. My original rating of a 10 / 10 dropped to an 8 /10. But today it has gone back up to a 10. The extended version of the film not only rectifies the gaps but also silences critics.Many claimed that the movie was too dark or that it just didn't make sense. To those people, I say: \"Pick up a comic book!\" Many of the critics of this particular film were part of the superhero bandwagon that formed when Marvel began its spree of Avengers-related films. In fact, its estimated that over 60% of people who go to see 'superhero' genre films have never picked up a comic book in their life. I would argue that similar numbers could figure to those which view the CW televised DC Universe shows. People complain that DC comics is just too dark but the fact is that these movies are based upon actual comics which are meant to be dark (ex: The Dark Knight Returns, Injustice, etc.). Its like complaining that Game of Thrones (the TV series) sucks because they kill off too many characters. Read the books! Its frustrating to see such a beautiful work of art like Batman V Superman criticized by those ignorant to its universe and its meaning. This movie is in fact a catalyst that opens numerous doorways and leaves true fans in awe of the possibilities for future movies. But regardless of whether or not people choose to educate themselves, this film's DVD/Blu-ray extended version puts the theater release to shame. All of the plot holes and gaps are filled in 30 minutes of extended footage scattered throughout the film. The movie ultimately becomes more complete and people will wish that the movie had shown the full 3 hours of footage in its theatrical debut. As a major DC comics fan, I will of course pick up on things that a comics fan would not, but someone who does not read comics would learn to appreciate this film in its entirety with the extended version. Get your hands on a copy today or find it on Netflix or the internet somewhere!"

"I ignored the bad reviews and watched anyways. This film had a lot to live up to after Civil War was released and I went into this film expecting the worst. It ended up to be the best Superhero film of 2016 to me. One complaint was that this film was more concerned about universe building than telling a great story than Civil War but for me it was the other way around; Civil War felt like a build up to something else and to be honest, I felt that way when I saw the other MCU films. Batman vs Superman however not only had a great story, but it also felt a lot more consistent than Civil War. This film was way more diverse with the cast than the MCU but unlike the MCU, I felt like this film doesn't go overboard with the SJW stuff like the MCU films or The Star Wars Sequel films do. The Visuals were AMAZING, The Score by Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL was AMAZING as well, The Tone is just right as I actually felt for the characters emotionally, The Cinematography kept my eyes glued to the screen, and the script felt really Intelligent and Complex and despite people calling the writing confusing, I was able to piece it together with no problem whatsoever. This film is similar to Empire Strikes back in terms of popularity so over time after the other movies are released, this movie would probably be more popular.This film was way better than I Expected and deserves another chance.

"Its shame to see what critics and marvel fans did to this movie and targeted Zack Snyder for it. I have seen this movie more than 25 times till date. And i enjoy this movie as much as i enjoyed the first time. The fans who have read DC comics, wouldn't be disappointed in this movie. Its dark movie, yes it is. Because the title shows the intense situation at hand. Two superheroes about to rip each other apart for whatever reasons that brought them to this stage. Yes it had to be dark and intense.Only marvel can be stupid enough to show an alien invasion where humans are loosing the battle and the super heroes are cracking jokes while battles as if they are playing ping pong. a person playing Call of Duty game is more serious while playing than the marvel heroes fighting aliens."

"Last week some news came out from somebody online who had claimed to have seen a finished version of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. If you were like me, you've been leery of checking it out because you weren't sure how much might actually be true. Now Zack Snyder has spoken out about the spoiler-filled post, although his response doesn't really clear anything up.In a word, to MTV, he called the post \"hilarious,which might imply that he's saying that it's mostly, if not entirely, untrue. That might be the case, but then again he could have just said it was untrue and he didn't say that. What he did say, however, is that he doesn't like spoilers. While this may seem odd for the director who's most recent trailer appeared to give away the entire movie, Snyder says that's not the case. Even if you've seen the trailer, you can rest easy, as there is much more we have not seen in then finished film. Says Snyder I have the benefit of seeing the movie. It's cool that think it's too much, and I appreciate people not wanting to know, but there's plenty that they don't know. There's a lot of movie that's not in the trailer. In the process of calling the Batman v Superman Reddit review hilarious, Snyder goes on to talk about how he hates it when spoilers come out. The director would much rather that fans see the movie mostly blind. While he understands that some fans may wish to find the answers before hand, he wants his movies to be mysteries going in. If you're, as an audience member, exploring these articles, looking for answers to questions that you have, maybe you're okay with knowing before you go. It's like an individual taste. But like I said, I want people to see the movie without knowing.Spoilers are a topic that mean different things to different people. While most try to avoid them to some degree, the need to solve the mystery is a nearly universal human experience. We have an inclination to want to know the truth, even while also wanting to be surprised. For most of us getting some information is good, but getting all the information is bad, of course, only getting the details that you want can be difficult."
"The theatrical is choppy, poorly edited, hard to follow, with some really good moments mixed in their. The extended is much more fluent and is much easier to follow, it does have a long runtime, which might make it seem a bit dragging on, but if you like long films done right, like Lord of the Rings, you will like this movie as long as you get into the characters and story. Speaking of which, the story starts out perfectly showing Bruce Wayne as a character, and it is very powerful. There are several moments in this movie that are powerful, emotional, and shocking. Characters. Batman is my favorite fictional character of all time, and believe me when I say, Ben Affleck as Batman was perfect, he had the charisma, the anger, and the look of being through some bad stuff Gal Gadot also does perfect as Wonder Woman, but if you want to really see how good she does, go watch the Wonder Woman movie. Henry Call as Superman. I really don't like it when people say Christopher Reeves is better. Don't get me wrong, Reeves does great, but can you imagine him as Superman in this movie? I wouldn't like it. It would be like Adam West playing Batman in The Dark Knight. Henry Cavill does great in this role, I can say everything about him as I said with Ben Affleck. Jesse Eisenberg as Luthor. I thought it was different in a good way. I've heard a criticism for him as being too much like Joker, but is that a bad thing? Joker is my favorite villain, so to see Superman have an enemy that crazy, but still hold the values Luthor needs to be Luthor, I think it is great. The thing I thought this movie was lacking in the first and second acts was humor, at least good humor. If there was more humor, I would've given this movie a ten because it would give a more relaxing feel to the parts that needed it. All in all though, this movie was awesome, it had powerful moments, it was badass, and just plain fun. It had a great story arc and does its job very well."

"*I will be talking about the Ultimate Edition of the film* This was one of the most anticipated CBM of all time. Ever since the arrival and subsequent success of Marvel's The Avengers people have wondered when will DC launch its own cinematic universe, one of the main reasons being the opportunity to finally see titans such as Batman and Superman share the screen together: the ultimate nerd dream. On 2016, the moment finally came for BvS to be released AND.. it performed poorly. Not only did critical reception left a lot to be desired, but fan reactions where surprisingly split after its cinematic debut. People either loved it and called Zack a genius, or hated it and called him a hack. Me, personally, I found myself with middle of the road feelings, for sure, but more leaning towards the negative side with subsequent viewings. The theatrical cut of the film showcased amazing performances, incredible visuals, and action set pieces that seemed like comic book panels come to life, in a good way. However, when it comes to its narrative structure and more technical aspects like editing, the film was seriously flawed. More plot holes than Age of Ultron, questionable character decisions, random editing that lacked cohesion and focus, and forced dramatic moments that lacked any impact because the attempts at character development ranged from limited to nonexistent, especially when it comes to Superman's character. I thought it was a 5/10 movie at best. As such, I was kind of skeptical about the idea of a 30 minute longer version. I say kind of because I know how Zack works. I remember Watchmen being vastly improved with its director's cut, so in a way I was expecting BvS to perform in a similar manner, but I also feared those 30 minutes wold be just there to amplify action and discredit storytelling issues. Oh boy, I'm so glad I was proved wrong. The ultimate cut of the film was infuriating, but not because it was awful, but because it questions the sanity of WB executives and editors and makes you wonder what were they thinking during the editing process. What I got out of the Ultimate Edition was a thought-provoking deconstruction of two very iconic superheroes that gave spotlight to the struggles both of them face when they aren't fighting crime. What I got was an extremely well produced character study on both Batman and Superman in a cynical world, a world dangerously close to our own. We meet Batman as a ruthless, worn out hero that has seen the failure behind his ideals and witnessed some truly horrifying things in his life. Superman, on the other hand, is portrayed as a godlike figure that seeks to do good in the world, but finds himself emotionally conflicted once he realized that every good deed he does leaves behind a trail of destruction (most of it due to Luthor's antics). In my opinion, this is a hugely original approach, one that distances itself from the rest of the competition and delivers a dark, somber, yet relevant superhero movie that understands both characters and gives them real human struggles to deal with. I felt invested in both of them, and hoped that by the end of the film both could find a way to redeem themselves. Their character arcs were very well established during the first two acts of the movie, and by the time we get to the titular climactic battle the emotion behind the jaw-dropping action is intensified. Lex Luthor as a villain was also given more time to develop with this new edition. One of the main criticisms with the original version was the fact that his plan relied too much on conveniences, and the character's mannerisms and mad-scientist attitude was annoying, and that goes without saying his motivations were unclear. Not only do we spend more time understanding his hate for any godlike figure and thus his hatred for Superman, but the added scenes allowed us to witness his entire plan come to fruition. It sells the cold, manipulative, calculating attributes of his comic counterpart. The acting is spot on. Every actor owns his/her role, from Cavill's Superman, to Ben Affleck as Batman, Eisenberg as Luthor, and Gadot as Wonder Woman, whose scenes are brief, but are more than enough to sell the strong and ferocious warrior that she is. Cinematography is stunning, and miles above that of Man of Steel's. And the soundtrack by Zimmer and Junkie XL? Perfect, just perfect. When it comes to flaws, the film still has some of those. The Martha moment, while serving as a pivotal character moment for Batman, felt off in execution, and its understandable that many people got mad at it. If your main complaint about BvS the first time around was its bleak tone and subject matter, this film is still not for you. I understand most were expecting to see the heroes being the most iconic versions of themselves, clashing in an elongated battle and evoking the same feelings The Avengers gave audiences back in 2012. In that sense, the film will remain divisive, but at least I have the comfort of saying that, at the very least, the film is competently made."

"This film was amazing. Ben Affleck was easily the best part of this movie, he brought his a-game as Batman. The chemistry between Affleck & Irons was outstanding. Gal Gadot did a great job as Wonder Woman. The fight between Batman & Superman was awesome. The final fight with Doomsday was outstanding in every way possible. However, there is only one problem with this film and that's Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor. He was sadly missed cast in this role, but then again it's really the fault of Warner Bros. Studios. Overall, this film deliver on almost every level. I highly recommend that you watch the extended version of this film."

"I know I know. I saw it in theaters too, and felt like it could've been so much better. While the Batman element was good, the narrative felt fractured, and the third act was just one long stunt scene. Superman was relegated to a supporting character, and other characters didn't get a chance to shine. And then I chanced on the ultimate cut. Calling it 30 mins of \"extra\" footage is unfair to Zack Snyder because it's exactly these 30 mins that makes the movie a worthy one. What I can say about the theatrical cut is this - It had the blockbuster elements - music, visuals, stunts, CGI. But, it lacked the human elements. The first 20 mins of the movie had it, but not after that. The extended cut in comparison has a flow to the narrative. There are no disjointed scenes, everything flows smoothly, and there's connective tissue. Superman gets to spend some time with his father, and mother. Clark Kent does some investigative journalism. Superman helps the people after the blast. Lois Lane doesn't jump to conclusions, she gets to the bottom of the crime. Lex Luthor apparently had a coherent plan - everything is explained pretty well. Wonder Woman was already good, so there's no change there :) Also, the \"Martha\" scene seems better executed, because it is a few seconds longer, and there's time to breathe it in. So, here's my take on this movie - The theatrical cut was junk. Get the Bluray for ultimate edition, and you shall not be disappointed. I've seen it so many more times now, and it's the definitive cut. It is the movie we deserve. It's a unique take on Batman, and Superman. It's a gritty take on the superhero movie genre, and definitely the best DCEU movie, and the best DC movie since The Dark Knight.P.S. Yes it's dark. We're adults, and we should appreciate mature film making without intentionally silly moments. It attempts to be philosophical, and something deep instead of just trying to make you chuckle."

"This is one of the best superhero movies ever made. Zack Snyder is a magician behind the camera.The reason behind so many complaints is the fact that Warner Bros. marketed this movie as a fight between Batman and Superman. That's not what it is. It's a movie about the origins of the Justice League.The cinematography, the acting and the score are all second to none. This film is phenomenal.P.S: watch the 3 hour extended cut that Snyder intended you to see, not the 2 and a half hour movie that Warner Bros. decided would be better for theaters."

"I don't care what the critics say, this is a very well-done movie. I'll start my review by listing what I like about the movie.1.) Ben Affleck is the best batman to me and it is not close. He pulls off the role of an aging batman extremely well. Also, Zack Snyder's vision of batman is legit. I have always hated batman up until this adaptation of him. Instead of being a conflicted and idealistic batman, this batman is dark, gritty, and 100% a badass. His equipment is decked out with machine guns and he has no aversion to killing people. In fact, he probably kills about 50 criminal by the time this movie is over. The warehouse scene is the coolest batman scene in any movie.2.) The development of a grudge between batman and superman is pulled off flawlessly. It actually makes sense why batman dislikes superman. Then, when they do fight it is about the coolest thing you can expect to see from a superhero film. 3.) I disagree with a lot of people about Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor. In my opinion, he played his role to perfection. 4.) B v S sets up Wonder Woman and Justice League with Gal Gadot's cameo as Wonder Woman and short clips of Aquaman, the Flash, and Cyborg. B v S is one of my favorite superhero films and rewatching it never gets old."

"The theatrical cut of this film is garbage which is why I rated it eight stars instead of nine. The first time I watched this film I didn't like it (not straight out hate but didn't like). Character motivations didn't make any sense, Lex was annoying as s***, editing was sloppy, and it was overly dark and broody for an action superhero movie. A year + a half, five Marvel films, a ton of bad reviews and a Justice League later a thought popped into my head: \"what if I watched BVS again\". This time I didn't have trailers ruining the best moments, I only vaguely remembered the film, and I was conditioned to look at it negatively but something unexpected happened: I actually loved it. Superman was just a normal person that tried to make a difference cause he could that others imposed their own beliefs on. Lex Luthor was a genius that couldn't stand his powerlessness compared to Superman or more accurately a super being. As Alfred said \"The fever, the rage, the feeling of powerlessness that turns good men... cruel\" and you see the same thought process in Batman. Batman, just like Lex Luthor feels powerless in the midst of a god-being and just like Lex he attempts to destroy him so he can get his sense of power back but unlike Lex, Batman learns something. I what is one of the corniest lines of the movie Superman says, \"Martha\" when he knows he can't win against Batman in a late desperate attempt to save his mother. Not only does this name connect with Bruce Wayne but it also shows what really matters to a man of steel: it isn't power, it isn't fame or anything else, it is his Mother and on a broader scale it is people. Lex (who doesn't care about people at all) knows he doesn't have the power so he creates something from his blood and the remains of Zod: A Doomsday for Superman. Not only does this film have depth but it also doesn't always explain it to you which is rare in a blockbuster action superhero flick normally cater to semi-comic book fans and people that want to shove popcorn in their mouths. This film rewards you for really noticing the details while still having massive explosions. One of my favorites is how Lex has all of Batman's branded killed which is why he isn't afraid of the branding at the end or Grandma's Peach Tea as a way of scaring the s*** out of someone. Of course, this film isn't perfect and I do have personal dislikes. The Batman V Superman fight was slow and pretty boring especially after watching such an amazing fight in Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 2 (If you haven't watched the animated Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 1 and 2 you are sorely missing out on something fantastic). Also, the addition of Wonder Woman who pretty much steals a hacker thing, gives it back and then suits up and fights against a giant monster thing. Not to say I don't like Wonder Woman (She is one of my favorite Superheroes of all time who showed not only can woman kick a** but they also don't need to be ashamed of their sexuality or gender) but she wasn't really that helpful to the plot and just brought in to expand the universe which was well done through Lex's superhuman hunting files. Also, the post-apocalyptic scene that was just a dream could have been cut but nothing is perfect except movies like Citizen Kane which isn't a lot of fun to watch cause it is too perfect. So to summarize, the theatrical cut is bad, the ultimate cut is Amazing and the other cut is meh. Please give it a second chance because it deserves it and save a good director from losing grace because of something he didn't do."
"I really liked it, don't know what all the hate is about. I'm actually a Marvel fan from when I was 7 or so, but Superman and Batman together in 1 movie? Just great. And personally I like Ben Affleck even better than Christian Bale as Batman. So just watch and enjoy, I know I did!"

"That's right. We have been waiting for these two heroes to finally meet and fight against each other. This movie is so good in both plot and special effects.Henry Cavill and Ben Affleck have performed well in their acting stages. They are the best superhero actors and they have filmed their fighting scenes very well. The movie starts to show the conflict between the lives of the heroes and now they have blamed each other for it. This movie is amazing and sets up a good plot for Dawn Justice."

"Actually...I didn't know what to expect. When you see Wonder Woman, you know it will be off of Wonder Woman and off of a Wonder Woman story, but with Batman V Superman, I was like, \"hmmmm, so who is this about?\" It was pretty obvious that it would feature many characters, but I thought the introduction to Batman was amazing. Ben Affleck nailed the part, not only as Batman but also as Bruce Wayne. He is my Batman. Henry Cavill continued to be super as the Man of Steel. And he is my Super - Man. A dark story? Yes, without a doubt. Could it have had a few more jokes? Sure. But not all movies or stories need to have jokes when certain events are serious. I really hope people can see this review and take another look at the movie, because, I loved it. I really hope the ratings can go up, eventually. And P.S, this movie is the perfect set up to Justice League."

"This film is crucial to the extended universe that DC is trying to build, but it feels highly derivative of better stories and continues to demonstrate the misuse of the iconic characters mentioned in the title. Plus Jesse Eisenberg feels wildly mis-casted."

"I'll start by making it clear I have only ever seen the Ultimate Edition. I'm aware of what was cut out for the theatrical release, so I will concede up front that most of the criticisms about pacing, editing, and missing bits of plot at release were merited.With that caveat out of the way, I must reiterate that this was bar-none the boldest superhero movie I have ever seen. To me, it was arguably the best as well, though \"best\" shouldn't be taken to mean \"most enjoyable.\" That honor easily goes to \"Thor: Ragnarok.\" What makes BvS stand out among other films in the genre is that it takes two characters who have been done to death since the 1970s and brings them up to date. I recently tried to watch \"Superman: The Movie\" for the first time in a number of years, and while it was still good and Reeves will always be iconic, I just couldn't take it seriously. I'll put it this way: If the story in BvS was \"stupid\" in your view but Superman turning back time by spinning the earth backward on its axis didn't seem like one of the dumbest things you have ever seen -in any movie from any genre- to the extent that it outright ruins the movie for you, then your opinion about BvS isn't worth much. Nostalgic bias was always going to be a problem for this movie, and the way people reacted to and reviewed \"Man of Steel\" was telling in this regard.That brings me to Zack Snyder's take on Superman. You know, that guy whose status as the first extraterrestrial ever encountered by humanity was a total non-issue in the old movies. Apparently, Snyder has a similar view to my own in that his take on the Man of Steel makes his being an alien a core piece of his identity. He may look like any other (absurdly attractive) person, but he knows what he is, and that makes him perpetually uncertain of where he fits in this world. He is essentially good and really does care about people, but he struggles to truly empathize with the likes of us. To be human is to be frail, and that is not something he can easily relate to. This is the root of his conflict with Batman.Just as Clark struggles to genuinely relate to most people, Snyder's Batman either refuses to or otherwise just can't relate to Superman. He doesn't see him as anything but a threat regardless of Superman's clear good intentions. Remember, a small group of Kryptonians were able to bring humanity to the brink of extinction in less than a day, and Bruce Wayne is nothing if not a realist. He didn't know the guy from Kansas. He only knew the god from another world.While Batman's anger toward and fear of Superman are readily apparent from the start, Superman's inability to imagine things from Bruce Wayne's perspective only becomes truly apparent during their first real interaction. This reminded me of the animated version of the \"world's finest\" storyline, where Superman judges Batman harshly for using fear tactics and threats of violence (also, actual violence) to get the job done. Superman wasn't willing to consider what it would take for a human man to fight criminals and save innocents, or what that life would do to him over time. Just as Batman didn't see the guy from Kansas, Superman didn't see the man who lives his life trapped in one brutal, unthinkably traumatic moment (this was beautifully conveyed during the film's opening moments), and had spent his whole adult life bearing witness to humanity at its absolute worst.The conflict between these two characters is as old as human history. They want the same things, but they can't understand one another. So they fight. And what a fight it was.Watching a fight between, say, Captain America and Iron Man was, to me, more frustrating than anything because each understood the other's perspective perfectly. The fight between Batman and Superman in BvS was genuinely gut-wrenching, as intended, because they would have understood one another if either had tried. The whole sequence hilighted Batman's tactical prowess and ability to control a situation. Maybe the most badass thing about the fight was that it ended exactly where Batman planned. That brings me to the big elephant in the room named \"Martha.\"I can't recall exactly which YouTuber put it this way, but if you thought the \"save Martha\" exchange was about their mothers having the same name, you had your brain turned off. The brain-on people have explained this to death, but it bears repeating. This was the moment when Superman became humanized to Batman. He was about to die, and his only concern was for his adoptive human mother. He still believed that the man about to take his life would do the right thing. Even with the cowl on, there was no mistaking the look on Batman's face. It was the look of shame, guilt, and sudden uncertainty that says \"What am I doing?\" Turns out even the most brutal, angry version of Bruce Wayne is better than Tony Stark at knowing right from wrong. At knowing that he had gone too far.From there, the third act was a series of truly impressive (albeit mostly CGI) fight sequences, beginning with what I regard as the undisputed champion of Batman fights. Nothing in the Nolan movies (and especially nothing in the Burton movies) even came close. Go ahead, try to convince yourself that Batman and Bane taking turns punching one another in the face until Bane's mask broke was a good fight sequence. No, this was a fight straight out of \"Arkham Knight,\" and it was glorious. The battle against Doomsday really was one for the books. From the moment Wonder Woman arrived accompanied by the intense sounds of Tina Guo's electric cello to Superman's tragic, heroic death at the hands of Doomsday, I was glued to the screen. Sure, the mere presence of Doomsday spoiled the end to a degree, but watching the Man of Steel laboring to carry that kryptonite spear towards certain death was no less impactful. A brief word on Jesse Eisenberg's take on Lex Luthor. At least one other reviewer on this site already said it best when they pointed out that this was his origin story. If you consider his scheme objectively, he is actually one of the more formidable incarnations of the character. If we're lucky, we'll eventually get to see a Snyder Cut of \"Justice League\" and find out where this story was actually meant to go. For the record, Joss Whedon and Danny Elfman both should have said \"no\" to taking a dump on someone else's art."
"BATMAN V SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE brings a fantastic surprise to a smash-hit team-up with one of the worlds most beloved DC Comics' icons of all time. The movie delivers spectacular casting, and fantastic acting with different characters having their shine in each scenes.The story follows Clark Kent/Superman who becomes a threat, after the destruction in Metropolis in Man Of Steel.(2013). Batman/Bruce Wayne sees him as a threat and begins his war on Superman.The movie brings spectacular storytelling, it tells the complications of human against alien who are on the same side, and the first meeting of Batman and Superman. The story of Bruce Wayne, with his many years of The Caped Crusader, sends him on a spiral of \"out of control\", sheer anger, and builds tension to wanting to defeat the Man of Steel. Snyder has fantastically gave this storytelling an exciting nod to the comics.Lex Luthor, played by Jesse Einsberg, delivers a very interesting performance, but very differently by him showing is his \"origin\" before he becomes a bald foe to the Man of Steel. He shows that his love of \"god vs man\" terrorises mankind when he ultimately creates Doomsday, and Batman realises Superman's inner heroism.It packs so many great \"out of nowhere\" excitement, including a first-look of the fearful Wonder Woman a.k.a. Diana Prince, played by Gal Gadot, and a fresh-new glimpse of the superhero DC canon: The Justice League.WATCH THIS MOVIE! The critics are out of their mind. It's a fun-packed action adventure which still keeps the movie enjoyable until it's final minutes of the movie. It's a FANTASTIC MOVIE! BEN AFFLECK AS BATMAN... is Incredible!A 10/10 overall!"
"I want to go on record as saying that this is a truly thrilling cinematic experience in so many ways. If pressed, I guess I could acknowledge that there were a couple ... let's say \"clumsy\" moments. And in a film that runs to three hours, that hardly seems like a significant issue, certainly not enough to rate it with fewer than 9 stars.This film has everything. There is dramatic tension right from the start. There is a magnificent story arc that picks up quite seamlessly from 'Man of Steel' and propels the viewer not only into the life of Clark Kent/Superman but also of Bruce Wayne/Batman.The villain is no mere cartoon of a villain; he is truly thoroughly (and apparently irrevocably) diabolical. He is a psychopath, and you wish for his death over and over and over. You want Superman to reduce him to ash with the power of his eyes.I have read a number of viewers' reviews, and it seems that the people who disliked the film / gave it a low rating had rather unfair and unrealistic expectations of it. That is, their own prejudices about how the plot could/should unfold or what the character development could/should be, etc. ruined the film for them. And that is a shame.My thought is: I settle into my seat, wait for the lights to dim, and then I wait to be transported by the film. I accept it, lock, stock, and barrel.As another reviewer remarked, I love how the film begins from the point of view of Bruce Wayne as he is among people on the ground who have fallen victim to the attack of Zod and the other Kryptonians.Why would Bruce Wayne not like Superman? Why would the good people of Earth hurl insults at Superman and burn him in effigy (on the news)? Because the good people of Earth just got catapulted into a new reality in which there are not only extraterrestrial beings (surprise!) but they are also superman! And a group of them are hell-bent on destroying humankind and taking the planet for themselves.It is difficult to see Superman as separate from the whole Kryptonian Krew.It seems that many moviegoers forgot that Bruce Wayne is also human. Sure, he's a hero, but he is flawed.. Just like the rest of us. He is a vigilante, after all.He has let his vigilantism get the better of him. HE is actually the one working outside the boundaries of the law, not Superman. It is the clear head of Alfred that shows us that he has gone into a rather dark place, that he has not seen what is really going on (in Luthor's scheme), and so he chooses to embark on his own scheme scheme to take out the alien invader. He is (allegedly) thinking of the future: if he wipes out the all-powerful alien, then it can't turn on humankind in the future. At least, he convinces himself of that.A philosophical question is raised in the film: should Clark Kent have remained a simple man from Kansas and never have become the Superman? Should he just let people die and let calamities happen? The question is answered for us in the character of Diana Prince/Wonder Woman. She withdrew from mankind (her exact words) and just sat around watching. Watching while people died horrible deaths all around her. So, should Superman have done the same? Do these special beings, these 'metahumans', have some kind of moral imperative to intervene, or should they be allowed to be regular people, too? It seems that humans want it both ways.It seems that humans are saying: \"Don't be a superalien ... except when I and my friends and family are in trouble. Then come save us.\""

"Batman v Superman: Ultimate Edition: If your looking for a quick, cheap thrill then you might not enjoy this film at the time. This movies theatrical version was butchered by WB and in doing so reshaped the story leaving numerous plot holes. So the Ultimate Edition is the full story and the one worth seeing. Watch 'Man of Steel' before seeing this movie. There is much to claw through here, so much so that the audience might easily find themselves exhausted from the overall aggression of the film. However, a lot of the story does work. The action is good, and the emotion feels real most of the time.This film is about Superman trying to become Superman. Trying to help the world, save people, find a place in this world not as an outcast, and yet is looked at has a threat by many. Superman is not from this world, yet He is trying to be human, find a place in this world, be excepted by earths people, and come into his destiny.This film is also about Batman being Batman for 20 years and losing faith in humanity, and fearing Superman, what Superman can do with his powers. Great film, great plot, great visuals. ---Yidioo"
"I didn't see the film in the theaters and just bought the \"Extended Edition \" on Amazon. I never properly saw Man of Steel- i think I rented it and watched it when already exhausted and fell asleep. I saw the mediocre user reviews and horrible reviews from critics of this film.They really have it wrong. This is the very best either Batman or Superman. It has a different take, on things. Much darker then earlier films even darker then the Christopher Nolan Batman films.First of all Christopher Nolan is an Executive Producer. So how bad could it be? I loved Sucker Punch and Zack Snyder was involved with that. So how bad could this be? Hans Zimmer did the music, so how bad could it be?I remember watching the old Superman TV shows and reading the Superman and Batman comics as a little kid and loved them, but i wouldn't call myself a \"fan boy\" of comic universes, like so many younger people today. As an older adult I will admit my favorite TV show of all time was Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but watched it on DVD only after it had finished. I saw the second of the Dark Knight series in the theater, but the other two, I watched on DVD. They were great, but not my favorite films like so many people. i also loved the first couple Superman and Batman films in the older series. Regardless, i was not waiting with baited breath to see Man of Steel or this one.I'm more of a serious film fan, who can watch Stanley Kubrick films over and over and my favorite films in the last twenty years, are Eyes Wide Shut and Intersteller, both of which i've watched multiple times.So, with that said, take it from me, the critics have this film very wrong, just as critics hated 2001: A Space Odyssey when it first came out. This film will have lasting appreciation.Surprised how much I liked Ben Afleck's Batman. it was hard to get into Henry Cavil's scrawnier looking Superman, but it grew on me. Amy Adams was great as Lois Lane, The Gal Gadol Wonder Women was amazing. Lex Luther was terrific, like Nolan's Joker. Jeremy Irons was the best Alfred ever. Holly Hunter and Diane Lane was good too. The movie had bad reviews but made a billion dollars. Hopefully everyone buys the Ultimate Edition and it breaks sales records and the film is re-appreciated. I have no idea what scenes this Ultimate Edition added, but it is pretty perfect. Now I can't wait for Wonder Woman and the Justice League and as soon as I finish writing this am going to watch Man of Steal. I'm into it now!I can only surmise that the bad reviews stem from too much expectations of the rigid fan boy types and the radical changes in tone, we see in this film.Total masterpiece of cinema, but I have a few criticisms. There are a few hollow scenes of typical Idiot cops and authorities getting everything wrong in a cliché type way and it has a few filler scenes of that type and a few moments here and there that felt rushed and cheesy. Maybe not everything restored into the Ultimate Edition should have been. I wish there had been more Kevin Costner scenes."

"The whole entire Batman V Superman movie was great and yes even though it felt slow to the majority of the people who watched it but to me I enjoyed every part and every scene of Batman V Superman and when it got to the fight scenes both batman VS Superman and the Doomsday fight it brought so much drama, intensity, and epic performances. So with that being said I give this movie a good 10/10 because it really did go to my expectations and it brought a powerful performance and a powerful yet epic introduction to the upcoming Justice League."

"When I first wrote a review for this movie a year ago exclaiming my excitement for the film, I had been high off a fresh dose of live-action DC superheroes playing out the beloved comic book stories that I had grown up on. It was all playing out before my eyes and coming to life. After a few months had passed, I began to notice things about the movie that I disliked: little gaps in the story, things that didn't add up, etc. My original rating of a 10 / 10 dropped to an 8 /10. But today it has gone back up to a 10. The extended version of the film not only rectifies the gaps but also silences critics.Many claimed that the movie was too dark or that it just didn't make sense. To those people, I say: \"Pick up a comic book!\" Many of the critics of this particular film were part of the superhero bandwagon that formed when Marvel began its spree of Avengers-related films. In fact, its estimated that over 60% of people who go to see 'superhero' genre films have never picked up a comic book in their life. I would argue that similar numbers could figure to those which view the CW televised DC Universe shows. People complain that DC comics is just too dark but the fact is that these movies are based upon actual comics which are meant to be dark (ex: The Dark Knight Returns, Injustice, etc.). Its like complaining that Game of Thrones (the TV series) sucks because they kill off too many characters. Read the books! Its frustrating to see such a beautiful work of art like Batman V Superman criticized by those ignorant to its universe and its meaning. This movie is in fact a catalyst that opens numerous doorways and leaves true fans in awe of the possibilities for future movies. But regardless of whether or not people choose to educate themselves, this film's DVD/Blu-ray extended version puts the theater release to shame. All of the plot holes and gaps are filled in 30 minutes of extended footage scattered throughout the film. The movie ultimately becomes more complete and people will wish that the movie had shown the full 3 hours of footage in its theatrical debut. As a major DC comics fan, I will of course pick up on things that a comics fan would not, but someone who does not read comics would learn to appreciate this film in its entirety with the extended version. Get your hands on a copy today or find it on Netflix or the internet somewhere!"

"I ignored the bad reviews and watched anyways. This film had a lot to live up to after Civil War was released and I went into this film expecting the worst. It ended up to be the best Superhero film of 2016 to me. One complaint was that this film was more concerned about universe building than telling a great story than Civil War but for me it was the other way around; Civil War felt like a build up to something else and to be honest, I felt that way when I saw the other MCU films. Batman vs Superman however not only had a great story, but it also felt a lot more consistent than Civil War. This film was way more diverse with the cast than the MCU but unlike the MCU, I felt like this film doesn't go overboard with the SJW stuff like the MCU films or The Star Wars Sequel films do. The Visuals were AMAZING, The Score by Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL was AMAZING as well, The Tone is just right as I actually felt for the characters emotionally, The Cinematography kept my eyes glued to the screen, and the script felt really Intelligent and Complex and despite people calling the writing confusing, I was able to piece it together with no problem whatsoever. This film is similar to Empire Strikes back in terms of popularity so over time after the other movies are released, this movie would probably be more popular.This film was way better than I Expected and deserves another chance.

"Its shame to see what critics and marvel fans did to this movie and targeted Zack Snyder for it. I have seen this movie more than 25 times till date. And i enjoy this movie as much as i enjoyed the first time. The fans who have read DC comics, wouldn't be disappointed in this movie. Its dark movie, yes it is. Because the title shows the intense situation at hand. Two superheroes about to rip each other apart for whatever reasons that brought them to this stage. Yes it had to be dark and intense.Only marvel can be stupid enough to show an alien invasion where humans are loosing the battle and the super heroes are cracking jokes while battles as if they are playing ping pong. a person playing Call of Duty game is more serious while playing than the marvel heroes fighting aliens."

"Last week some news came out from somebody online who had claimed to have seen a finished version of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. If you were like me, you've been leery of checking it out because you weren't sure how much might actually be true. Now Zack Snyder has spoken out about the spoiler-filled post, although his response doesn't really clear anything up.In a word, to MTV, he called the post \"hilarious,which might imply that he's saying that it's mostly, if not entirely, untrue. That might be the case, but then again he could have just said it was untrue and he didn't say that. What he did say, however, is that he doesn't like spoilers. While this may seem odd for the director who's most recent trailer appeared to give away the entire movie, Snyder says that's not the case. Even if you've seen the trailer, you can rest easy, as there is much more we have not seen in then finished film. Says Snyder I have the benefit of seeing the movie. It's cool that think it's too much, and I appreciate people not wanting to know, but there's plenty that they don't know. There's a lot of movie that's not in the trailer. In the process of calling the Batman v Superman Reddit review hilarious, Snyder goes on to talk about how he hates it when spoilers come out. The director would much rather that fans see the movie mostly blind. While he understands that some fans may wish to find the answers before hand, he wants his movies to be mysteries going in. If you're, as an audience member, exploring these articles, looking for answers to questions that you have, maybe you're okay with knowing before you go. It's like an individual taste. But like I said, I want people to see the movie without knowing.Spoilers are a topic that mean different things to different people. While most try to avoid them to some degree, the need to solve the mystery is a nearly universal human experience. We have an inclination to want to know the truth, even while also wanting to be surprised. For most of us getting some information is good, but getting all the information is bad, of course, only getting the details that you want can be difficult."
"The theatrical is choppy, poorly edited, hard to follow, with some really good moments mixed in their. The extended is much more fluent and is much easier to follow, it does have a long runtime, which might make it seem a bit dragging on, but if you like long films done right, like Lord of the Rings, you will like this movie as long as you get into the characters and story. Speaking of which, the story starts out perfectly showing Bruce Wayne as a character, and it is very powerful. There are several moments in this movie that are powerful, emotional, and shocking. Characters. Batman is my favorite fictional character of all time, and believe me when I say, Ben Affleck as Batman was perfect, he had the charisma, the anger, and the look of being through some bad stuff Gal Gadot also does perfect as Wonder Woman, but if you want to really see how good she does, go watch the Wonder Woman movie. Henry Call as Superman. I really don't like it when people say Christopher Reeves is better. Don't get me wrong, Reeves does great, but can you imagine him as Superman in this movie? I wouldn't like it. It would be like Adam West playing Batman in The Dark Knight. Henry Cavill does great in this role, I can say everything about him as I said with Ben Affleck. Jesse Eisenberg as Luthor. I thought it was different in a good way. I've heard a criticism for him as being too much like Joker, but is that a bad thing? Joker is my favorite villain, so to see Superman have an enemy that crazy, but still hold the values Luthor needs to be Luthor, I think it is great. The thing I thought this movie was lacking in the first and second acts was humor, at least good humor. If there was more humor, I would've given this movie a ten because it would give a more relaxing feel to the parts that needed it. All in all though, this movie was awesome, it had powerful moments, it was badass, and just plain fun. It had a great story arc and does its job very well."

"*I will be talking about the Ultimate Edition of the film* This was one of the most anticipated CBM of all time. Ever since the arrival and subsequent success of Marvel's The Avengers people have wondered when will DC launch its own cinematic universe, one of the main reasons being the opportunity to finally see titans such as Batman and Superman share the screen together: the ultimate nerd dream. On 2016, the moment finally came for BvS to be released AND.. it performed poorly. Not only did critical reception left a lot to be desired, but fan reactions where surprisingly split after its cinematic debut. People either loved it and called Zack a genius, or hated it and called him a hack. Me, personally, I found myself with middle of the road feelings, for sure, but more leaning towards the negative side with subsequent viewings. The theatrical cut of the film showcased amazing performances, incredible visuals, and action set pieces that seemed like comic book panels come to life, in a good way. However, when it comes to its narrative structure and more technical aspects like editing, the film was seriously flawed. More plot holes than Age of Ultron, questionable character decisions, random editing that lacked cohesion and focus, and forced dramatic moments that lacked any impact because the attempts at character development ranged from limited to nonexistent, especially when it comes to Superman's character. I thought it was a 5/10 movie at best. As such, I was kind of skeptical about the idea of a 30 minute longer version. I say kind of because I know how Zack works. I remember Watchmen being vastly improved with its director's cut, so in a way I was expecting BvS to perform in a similar manner, but I also feared those 30 minutes wold be just there to amplify action and discredit storytelling issues. Oh boy, I'm so glad I was proved wrong. The ultimate cut of the film was infuriating, but not because it was awful, but because it questions the sanity of WB executives and editors and makes you wonder what were they thinking during the editing process. What I got out of the Ultimate Edition was a thought-provoking deconstruction of two very iconic superheroes that gave spotlight to the struggles both of them face when they aren't fighting crime. What I got was an extremely well produced character study on both Batman and Superman in a cynical world, a world dangerously close to our own. We meet Batman as a ruthless, worn out hero that has seen the failure behind his ideals and witnessed some truly horrifying things in his life. Superman, on the other hand, is portrayed as a godlike figure that seeks to do good in the world, but finds himself emotionally conflicted once he realized that every good deed he does leaves behind a trail of destruction (most of it due to Luthor's antics). In my opinion, this is a hugely original approach, one that distances itself from the rest of the competition and delivers a dark, somber, yet relevant superhero movie that understands both characters and gives them real human struggles to deal with. I felt invested in both of them, and hoped that by the end of the film both could find a way to redeem themselves. Their character arcs were very well established during the first two acts of the movie, and by the time we get to the titular climactic battle the emotion behind the jaw-dropping action is intensified. Lex Luthor as a villain was also given more time to develop with this new edition. One of the main criticisms with the original version was the fact that his plan relied too much on conveniences, and the character's mannerisms and mad-scientist attitude was annoying, and that goes without saying his motivations were unclear. Not only do we spend more time understanding his hate for any godlike figure and thus his hatred for Superman, but the added scenes allowed us to witness his entire plan come to fruition. It sells the cold, manipulative, calculating attributes of his comic counterpart. The acting is spot on. Every actor owns his/her role, from Cavill's Superman, to Ben Affleck as Batman, Eisenberg as Luthor, and Gadot as Wonder Woman, whose scenes are brief, but are more than enough to sell the strong and ferocious warrior that she is. Cinematography is stunning, and miles above that of Man of Steel's. And the soundtrack by Zimmer and Junkie XL? Perfect, just perfect. When it comes to flaws, the film still has some of those. The Martha moment, while serving as a pivotal character moment for Batman, felt off in execution, and its understandable that many people got mad at it. If your main complaint about BvS the first time around was its bleak tone and subject matter, this film is still not for you. I understand most were expecting to see the heroes being the most iconic versions of themselves, clashing in an elongated battle and evoking the same feelings The Avengers gave audiences back in 2012. In that sense, the film will remain divisive, but at least I have the comfort of saying that, at the very least, the film is competently made."

"This film was amazing. Ben Affleck was easily the best part of this movie, he brought his a-game as Batman. The chemistry between Affleck & Irons was outstanding. Gal Gadot did a great job as Wonder Woman. The fight between Batman & Superman was awesome. The final fight with Doomsday was outstanding in every way possible. However, there is only one problem with this film and that's Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor. He was sadly missed cast in this role, but then again it's really the fault of Warner Bros. Studios. Overall, this film deliver on almost every level. I highly recommend that you watch the extended version of this film."

"I know I know. I saw it in theaters too, and felt like it could've been so much better. While the Batman element was good, the narrative felt fractured, and the third act was just one long stunt scene. Superman was relegated to a supporting character, and other characters didn't get a chance to shine. And then I chanced on the ultimate cut. Calling it 30 mins of \"extra\" footage is unfair to Zack Snyder because it's exactly these 30 mins that makes the movie a worthy one. What I can say about the theatrical cut is this - It had the blockbuster elements - music, visuals, stunts, CGI. But, it lacked the human elements. The first 20 mins of the movie had it, but not after that. The extended cut in comparison has a flow to the narrative. There are no disjointed scenes, everything flows smoothly, and there's connective tissue. Superman gets to spend some time with his father, and mother. Clark Kent does some investigative journalism. Superman helps the people after the blast. Lois Lane doesn't jump to conclusions, she gets to the bottom of the crime. Lex Luthor apparently had a coherent plan - everything is explained pretty well. Wonder Woman was already good, so there's no change there :) Also, the \"Martha\" scene seems better executed, because it is a few seconds longer, and there's time to breathe it in. So, here's my take on this movie - The theatrical cut was junk. Get the Bluray for ultimate edition, and you shall not be disappointed. I've seen it so many more times now, and it's the definitive cut. It is the movie we deserve. It's a unique take on Batman, and Superman. It's a gritty take on the superhero movie genre, and definitely the best DCEU movie, and the best DC movie since The Dark Knight.P.S. Yes it's dark. We're adults, and we should appreciate mature film making without intentionally silly moments. It attempts to be philosophical, and something deep instead of just trying to make you chuckle."

"This is one of the best superhero movies ever made. Zack Snyder is a magician behind the camera.The reason behind so many complaints is the fact that Warner Bros. marketed this movie as a fight between Batman and Superman. That's not what it is. It's a movie about the origins of the Justice League.The cinematography, the acting and the score are all second to none. This film is phenomenal.P.S: watch the 3 hour extended cut that Snyder intended you to see, not the 2 and a half hour movie that Warner Bros. decided would be better for theaters."

"I don't care what the critics say, this is a very well-done movie. I'll start my review by listing what I like about the movie.1.) Ben Affleck is the best batman to me and it is not close. He pulls off the role of an aging batman extremely well. Also, Zack Snyder's vision of batman is legit. I have always hated batman up until this adaptation of him. Instead of being a conflicted and idealistic batman, this batman is dark, gritty, and 100% a badass. His equipment is decked out with machine guns and he has no aversion to killing people. In fact, he probably kills about 50 criminal by the time this movie is over. The warehouse scene is the coolest batman scene in any movie.2.) The development of a grudge between batman and superman is pulled off flawlessly. It actually makes sense why batman dislikes superman. Then, when they do fight it is about the coolest thing you can expect to see from a superhero film. 3.) I disagree with a lot of people about Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor. In my opinion, he played his role to perfection. 4.) B v S sets up Wonder Woman and Justice League with Gal Gadot's cameo as Wonder Woman and short clips of Aquaman, the Flash, and Cyborg. B v S is one of my favorite superhero films and rewatching it never gets old."

"The theatrical cut of this film is garbage which is why I rated it eight stars instead of nine. The first time I watched this film I didn't like it (not straight out hate but didn't like). Character motivations didn't make any sense, Lex was annoying as s***, editing was sloppy, and it was overly dark and broody for an action superhero movie. A year + a half, five Marvel films, a ton of bad reviews and a Justice League later a thought popped into my head: \"what if I watched BVS again\". This time I didn't have trailers ruining the best moments, I only vaguely remembered the film, and I was conditioned to look at it negatively but something unexpected happened: I actually loved it. Superman was just a normal person that tried to make a difference cause he could that others imposed their own beliefs on. Lex Luthor was a genius that couldn't stand his powerlessness compared to Superman or more accurately a super being. As Alfred said \"The fever, the rage, the feeling of powerlessness that turns good men... cruel\" and you see the same thought process in Batman. Batman, just like Lex Luthor feels powerless in the midst of a god-being and just like Lex he attempts to destroy him so he can get his sense of power back but unlike Lex, Batman learns something. I what is one of the corniest lines of the movie Superman says, \"Martha\" when he knows he can't win against Batman in a late desperate attempt to save his mother. Not only does this name connect with Bruce Wayne but it also shows what really matters to a man of steel: it isn't power, it isn't fame or anything else, it is his Mother and on a broader scale it is people. Lex (who doesn't care about people at all) knows he doesn't have the power so he creates something from his blood and the remains of Zod: A Doomsday for Superman. Not only does this film have depth but it also doesn't always explain it to you which is rare in a blockbuster action superhero flick normally cater to semi-comic book fans and people that want to shove popcorn in their mouths. This film rewards you for really noticing the details while still having massive explosions. One of my favorites is how Lex has all of Batman's branded killed which is why he isn't afraid of the branding at the end or Grandma's Peach Tea as a way of scaring the s*** out of someone. Of course, this film isn't perfect and I do have personal dislikes. The Batman V Superman fight was slow and pretty boring especially after watching such an amazing fight in Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 2 (If you haven't watched the animated Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 1 and 2 you are sorely missing out on something fantastic). Also, the addition of Wonder Woman who pretty much steals a hacker thing, gives it back and then suits up and fights against a giant monster thing. Not to say I don't like Wonder Woman (She is one of my favorite Superheroes of all time who showed not only can woman kick a** but they also don't need to be ashamed of their sexuality or gender) but she wasn't really that helpful to the plot and just brought in to expand the universe which was well done through Lex's superhuman hunting files. Also, the post-apocalyptic scene that was just a dream could have been cut but nothing is perfect except movies like Citizen Kane which isn't a lot of fun to watch cause it is too perfect. So to summarize, the theatrical cut is bad, the ultimate cut is Amazing and the other cut is meh. Please give it a second chance because it deserves it and save a good director from losing grace because of something he didn't do."
"I really liked it, don't know what all the hate is about. I'm actually a Marvel fan from when I was 7 or so, but Superman and Batman together in 1 movie? Just great. And personally I like Ben Affleck even better than Christian Bale as Batman. So just watch and enjoy, I know I did!"

"That's right. We have been waiting for these two heroes to finally meet and fight against each other. This movie is so good in both plot and special effects.Henry Cavill and Ben Affleck have performed well in their acting stages. They are the best superhero actors and they have filmed their fighting scenes very well. The movie starts to show the conflict between the lives of the heroes and now they have blamed each other for it. This movie is amazing and sets up a good plot for Dawn Justice."

"Actually...I didn't know what to expect. When you see Wonder Woman, you know it will be off of Wonder Woman and off of a Wonder Woman story, but with Batman V Superman, I was like, \"hmmmm, so who is this about?\" It was pretty obvious that it would feature many characters, but I thought the introduction to Batman was amazing. Ben Affleck nailed the part, not only as Batman but also as Bruce Wayne. He is my Batman. Henry Cavill continued to be super as the Man of Steel. And he is my Super - Man. A dark story? Yes, without a doubt. Could it have had a few more jokes? Sure. But not all movies or stories need to have jokes when certain events are serious. I really hope people can see this review and take another look at the movie, because, I loved it. I really hope the ratings can go up, eventually. And P.S, this movie is the perfect set up to Justice League."

"I'll start by making it clear I have only ever seen the Ultimate Edition. I'm aware of what was cut out for the theatrical release, so I will concede up front that most of the criticisms about pacing, editing, and missing bits of plot at release were merited.With that caveat out of the way, I must reiterate that this was bar-none the boldest superhero movie I have ever seen. To me, it was arguably the best as well, though \"best\" shouldn't be taken to mean \"most enjoyable.\" That honor easily goes to \"Thor: Ragnarok.\" What makes BvS stand out among other films in the genre is that it takes two characters who have been done to death since the 1970s and brings them up to date. I recently tried to watch \"Superman: The Movie\" for the first time in a number of years, and while it was still good and Reeves will always be iconic, I just couldn't take it seriously. I'll put it this way: If the story in BvS was \"stupid\" in your view but Superman turning back time by spinning the earth backward on its axis didn't seem like one of the dumbest things you have ever seen -in any movie from any genre- to the extent that it outright ruins the movie for you, then your opinion about BvS isn't worth much. Nostalgic bias was always going to be a problem for this movie, and the way people reacted to and reviewed \"Man of Steel\" was telling in this regard.That brings me to Zack Snyder's take on Superman. You know, that guy whose status as the first extraterrestrial ever encountered by humanity was a total non-issue in the old movies. Apparently, Snyder has a similar view to my own in that his take on the Man of Steel makes his being an alien a core piece of his identity. He may look like any other (absurdly attractive) person, but he knows what he is, and that makes him perpetually uncertain of where he fits in this world. He is essentially good and really does care about people, but he struggles to truly empathize with the likes of us. To be human is to be frail, and that is not something he can easily relate to. This is the root of his conflict with Batman.Just as Clark struggles to genuinely relate to most people, Snyder's Batman either refuses to or otherwise just can't relate to Superman. He doesn't see him as anything but a threat regardless of Superman's clear good intentions. Remember, a small group of Kryptonians were able to bring humanity to the brink of extinction in less than a day, and Bruce Wayne is nothing if not a realist. He didn't know the guy from Kansas. He only knew the god from another world.While Batman's anger toward and fear of Superman are readily apparent from the start, Superman's inability to imagine things from Bruce Wayne's perspective only becomes truly apparent during their first real interaction. This reminded me of the animated version of the \"world's finest\" storyline, where Superman judges Batman harshly for using fear tactics and threats of violence (also, actual violence) to get the job done. Superman wasn't willing to consider what it would take for a human man to fight criminals and save innocents, or what that life would do to him over time. Just as Batman didn't see the guy from Kansas, Superman didn't see the man who lives his life trapped in one brutal, unthinkably traumatic moment (this was beautifully conveyed during the film's opening moments), and had spent his whole adult life bearing witness to humanity at its absolute worst.The conflict between these two characters is as old as human history. They want the same things, but they can't understand one another. So they fight. And what a fight it was.Watching a fight between, say, Captain America and Iron Man was, to me, more frustrating than anything because each understood the other's perspective perfectly. The fight between Batman and Superman in BvS was genuinely gut-wrenching, as intended, because they would have understood one another if either had tried. The whole sequence hilighted Batman's tactical prowess and ability to control a situation. Maybe the most badass thing about the fight was that it ended exactly where Batman planned. That brings me to the big elephant in the room named \"Martha.\"I can't recall exactly which YouTuber put it this way, but if you thought the \"save Martha\" exchange was about their mothers having the same name, you had your brain turned off. The brain-on people have explained this to death, but it bears repeating. This was the moment when Superman became humanized to Batman. He was about to die, and his only concern was for his adoptive human mother. He still believed that the man about to take his life would do the right thing. Even with the cowl on, there was no mistaking the look on Batman's face. It was the look of shame, guilt, and sudden uncertainty that says \"What am I doing?\" Turns out even the most brutal, angry version of Bruce Wayne is better than Tony Stark at knowing right from wrong. At knowing that he had gone too far.From there, the third act was a series of truly impressive (albeit mostly CGI) fight sequences, beginning with what I regard as the undisputed champion of Batman fights. Nothing in the Nolan movies (and especially nothing in the Burton movies) even came close. Go ahead, try to convince yourself that Batman and Bane taking turns punching one another in the face until Bane's mask broke was a good fight sequence. No, this was a fight straight out of \"Arkham Knight,\" and it was glorious. The battle against Doomsday really was one for the books. From the moment Wonder Woman arrived accompanied by the intense sounds of Tina Guo's electric cello to Superman's tragic, heroic death at the hands of Doomsday, I was glued to the screen. Sure, the mere presence of Doomsday spoiled the end to a degree, but watching the Man of Steel laboring to carry that kryptonite spear towards certain death was no less impactful. A brief word on Jesse Eisenberg's take on Lex Luthor. At least one other reviewer on this site already said it best when they pointed out that this was his origin story. If you consider his scheme objectively, he is actually one of the more formidable incarnations of the character. If we're lucky, we'll eventually get to see a Snyder Cut of \"Justice League\" and find out where this story was actually meant to go. For the record, Joss Whedon and Danny Elfman both should have said \"no\" to taking a dump on someone else's art."
"BATMAN V SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE brings a fantastic surprise to a smash-hit team-up with one of the worlds most beloved DC Comics' icons of all time. The movie delivers spectacular casting, and fantastic acting with different characters having their shine in each scenes.The story follows Clark Kent/Superman who becomes a threat, after the destruction in Metropolis in Man Of Steel.(2013). Batman/Bruce Wayne sees him as a threat and begins his war on Superman.The movie brings spectacular storytelling, it tells the complications of human against alien who are on the same side, and the first meeting of Batman and Superman. The story of Bruce Wayne, with his many years of The Caped Crusader, sends him on a spiral of \"out of control\", sheer anger, and builds tension to wanting to defeat the Man of Steel. Snyder has fantastically gave this storytelling an exciting nod to the comics.Lex Luthor, played by Jesse Einsberg, delivers a very interesting performance, but very differently by him showing is his \"origin\" before he becomes a bald foe to the Man of Steel. He shows that his love of \"god vs man\" terrorises mankind when he ultimately creates Doomsday, and Batman realises Superman's inner heroism.It packs so many great \"out of nowhere\" excitement, including a first-look of the fearful Wonder Woman a.k.a. Diana Prince, played by Gal Gadot, and a fresh-new glimpse of the superhero DC canon: The Justice League.WATCH THIS MOVIE! The critics are out of their mind. It's a fun-packed action adventure which still keeps the movie enjoyable until it's final minutes of the movie. It's a FANTASTIC MOVIE! BEN AFFLECK AS BATMAN... is Incredible!A 10/10 overall!"
"I want to go on record as saying that this is a truly thrilling cinematic experience in so many ways. If pressed, I guess I could acknowledge that there were a couple ... let's say \"clumsy\" moments. And in a film that runs to three hours, that hardly seems like a significant issue, certainly not enough to rate it with fewer than 9 stars.This film has everything. There is dramatic tension right from the start. There is a magnificent story arc that picks up quite seamlessly from 'Man of Steel' and propels the viewer not only into the life of Clark Kent/Superman but also of Bruce Wayne/Batman.The villain is no mere cartoon of a villain; he is truly thoroughly (and apparently irrevocably) diabolical. He is a psychopath, and you wish for his death over and over and over. You want Superman to reduce him to ash with the power of his eyes.I have read a number of viewers' reviews, and it seems that the people who disliked the film / gave it a low rating had rather unfair and unrealistic expectations of it. That is, their own prejudices about how the plot could/should unfold or what the character development could/should be, etc. ruined the film for them. And that is a shame.My thought is: I settle into my seat, wait for the lights to dim, and then I wait to be transported by the film. I accept it, lock, stock, and barrel.As another reviewer remarked, I love how the film begins from the point of view of Bruce Wayne as he is among people on the ground who have fallen victim to the attack of Zod and the other Kryptonians.Why would Bruce Wayne not like Superman? Why would the good people of Earth hurl insults at Superman and burn him in effigy (on the news)? Because the good people of Earth just got catapulted into a new reality in which there are not only extraterrestrial beings (surprise!) but they are also superman! And a group of them are hell-bent on destroying humankind and taking the planet for themselves.It is difficult to see Superman as separate from the whole Kryptonian Krew.It seems that many moviegoers forgot that Bruce Wayne is also human. Sure, he's a hero, but he is flawed.. Just like the rest of us. He is a vigilante, after all.He has let his vigilantism get the better of him. HE is actually the one working outside the boundaries of the law, not Superman. It is the clear head of Alfred that shows us that he has gone into a rather dark place, that he has not seen what is really going on (in Luthor's scheme), and so he chooses to embark on his own scheme scheme to take out the alien invader. He is (allegedly) thinking of the future: if he wipes out the all-powerful alien, then it can't turn on humankind in the future. At least, he convinces himself of that.A philosophical question is raised in the film: should Clark Kent have remained a simple man from Kansas and never have become the Superman? Should he just let people die and let calamities happen? The question is answered for us in the character of Diana Prince/Wonder Woman. She withdrew from mankind (her exact words) and just sat around watching. Watching while people died horrible deaths all around her. So, should Superman have done the same? Do these special beings, these 'metahumans', have some kind of moral imperative to intervene, or should they be allowed to be regular people, too? It seems that humans want it both ways.It seems that humans are saying: \"Don't be a superalien ... except when I and my friends and family are in trouble. Then come save us.\""

"Batman v Superman: Ultimate Edition: If your looking for a quick, cheap thrill then you might not enjoy this film at the time. This movies theatrical version was butchered by WB and in doing so reshaped the story leaving numerous plot holes. So the Ultimate Edition is the full story and the one worth seeing. Watch 'Man of Steel' before seeing this movie. There is much to claw through here, so much so that the audience might easily find themselves exhausted from the overall aggression of the film. However, a lot of the story does work. The action is good, and the emotion feels real most of the time.This film is about Superman trying to become Superman. Trying to help the world, save people, find a place in this world not as an outcast, and yet is looked at has a threat by many. Superman is not from this world, yet He is trying to be human, find a place in this world, be excepted by earths people, and come into his destiny.This film is also about Batman being Batman for 20 years and losing faith in humanity, and fearing Superman, what Superman can do with his powers. Great film, great plot, great visuals. ---Yidioo"
"I didn't see the film in the theaters and just bought the \"Extended Edition \" on Amazon. I never properly saw Man of Steel- i think I rented it and watched it when already exhausted and fell asleep. I saw the mediocre user reviews and horrible reviews from critics of this film.They really have it wrong. This is the very best either Batman or Superman. It has a different take, on things. Much darker then earlier films even darker then the Christopher Nolan Batman films.First of all Christopher Nolan is an Executive Producer. So how bad could it be? I loved Sucker Punch and Zack Snyder was involved with that. So how bad could this be? Hans Zimmer did the music, so how bad could it be?I remember watching the old Superman TV shows and reading the Superman and Batman comics as a little kid and loved them, but i wouldn't call myself a \"fan boy\" of comic universes, like so many younger people today. As an older adult I will admit my favorite TV show of all time was Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but watched it on DVD only after it had finished. I saw the second of the Dark Knight series in the theater, but the other two, I watched on DVD. They were great, but not my favorite films like so many people. i also loved the first couple Superman and Batman films in the older series. Regardless, i was not waiting with baited breath to see Man of Steel or this one.I'm more of a serious film fan, who can watch Stanley Kubrick films over and over and my favorite films in the last twenty years, are Eyes Wide Shut and Intersteller, both of which i've watched multiple times.So, with that said, take it from me, the critics have this film very wrong, just as critics hated 2001: A Space Odyssey when it first came out. This film will have lasting appreciation.Surprised how much I liked Ben Afleck's Batman. it was hard to get into Henry Cavil's scrawnier looking Superman, but it grew on me. Amy Adams was great as Lois Lane, The Gal Gadol Wonder Women was amazing. Lex Luther was terrific, like Nolan's Joker. Jeremy Irons was the best Alfred ever. Holly Hunter and Diane Lane was good too. The movie had bad reviews but made a billion dollars. Hopefully everyone buys the Ultimate Edition and it breaks sales records and the film is re-appreciated. I have no idea what scenes this Ultimate Edition added, but it is pretty perfect. Now I can't wait for Wonder Woman and the Justice League and as soon as I finish writing this am going to watch Man of Steal. I'm into it now!I can only surmise that the bad reviews stem from too much expectations of the rigid fan boy types and the radical changes in tone, we see in this film.Total masterpiece of cinema, but I have a few criticisms. There are a few hollow scenes of typical Idiot cops and authorities getting everything wrong in a cliché type way and it has a few filler scenes of that type and a few moments here and there that felt rushed and cheesy. Maybe not everything restored into the Ultimate Edition should have been. I wish there had been more Kevin Costner scenes."

"The whole entire Batman V Superman movie was great and yes even though it felt slow to the majority of the people who watched it but to me I enjoyed every part and every scene of Batman V Superman and when it got to the fight scenes both batman VS Superman and the Doomsday fight it brought so much drama, intensity, and epic performances. So with that being said I give this movie a good 10/10 because it really did go to my expectations and it brought a powerful performance and a powerful yet epic introduction to the upcoming Justice League."

"When I first wrote a review for this movie a year ago exclaiming my excitement for the film, I had been high off a fresh dose of live-action DC superheroes playing out the beloved comic book stories that I had grown up on. It was all playing out before my eyes and coming to life. After a few months had passed, I began to notice things about the movie that I disliked: little gaps in the story, things that didn't add up, etc. My original rating of a 10 / 10 dropped to an 8 /10. But today it has gone back up to a 10. The extended version of the film not only rectifies the gaps but also silences critics.Many claimed that the movie was too dark or that it just didn't make sense. To those people, I say: \"Pick up a comic book!\" Many of the critics of this particular film were part of the superhero bandwagon that formed when Marvel began its spree of Avengers-related films. In fact, its estimated that over 60% of people who go to see 'superhero' genre films have never picked up a comic book in their life. I would argue that similar numbers could figure to those which view the CW televised DC Universe shows. People complain that DC comics is just too dark but the fact is that these movies are based upon actual comics which are meant to be dark (ex: The Dark Knight Returns, Injustice, etc.). Its like complaining that Game of Thrones (the TV series) sucks because they kill off too many characters. Read the books! Its frustrating to see such a beautiful work of art like Batman V Superman criticized by those ignorant to its universe and its meaning. This movie is in fact a catalyst that opens numerous doorways and leaves true fans in awe of the possibilities for future movies. But regardless of whether or not people choose to educate themselves, this film's DVD/Blu-ray extended version puts the theater release to shame. All of the plot holes and gaps are filled in 30 minutes of extended footage scattered throughout the film. The movie ultimately becomes more complete and people will wish that the movie had shown the full 3 hours of footage in its theatrical debut. As a major DC comics fan, I will of course pick up on things that a comics fan would not, but someone who does not read comics would learn to appreciate this film in its entirety with the extended version. Get your hands on a copy today or find it on Netflix or the internet somewhere!"

"I ignored the bad reviews and watched anyways. This film had a lot to live up to after Civil War was released and I went into this film expecting the worst. It ended up to be the best Superhero film of 2016 to me. One complaint was that this film was more concerned about universe building than telling a great story than Civil War but for me it was the other way around; Civil War felt like a build up to something else and to be honest, I felt that way when I saw the other MCU films. Batman vs Superman however not only had a great story, but it also felt a lot more consistent than Civil War. This film was way more diverse with the cast than the MCU but unlike the MCU, I felt like this film doesn't go overboard with the SJW stuff like the MCU films or The Star Wars Sequel films do. The Visuals were AMAZING, The Score by Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL was AMAZING as well, The Tone is just right as I actually felt for the characters emotionally, The Cinematography kept my eyes glued to the screen, and the script felt really Intelligent and Complex and despite people calling the writing confusing, I was able to piece it together with no problem whatsoever. This film is similar to Empire Strikes back in terms of popularity so over time after the other movies are released, this movie would probably be more popular.This film was way better than I Expected and deserves another chance.

"Its shame to see what critics and marvel fans did to this movie and targeted Zack Snyder for it. I have seen this movie more than 25 times till date. And i enjoy this movie as much as i enjoyed the first time. The fans who have read DC comics, wouldn't be disappointed in this movie. Its dark movie, yes it is. Because the title shows the intense situation at hand. Two superheroes about to rip each other apart for whatever reasons that brought them to this stage. Yes it had to be dark and intense.Only marvel can be stupid enough to show an alien invasion where humans are loosing the battle and the super heroes are cracking jokes while battles as if they are playing ping pong. a person playing Call of Duty game is more serious while playing than the marvel heroes fighting aliens."

"Last week some news came out from somebody online who had claimed to have seen a finished version of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. If you were like me, you've been leery of checking it out because you weren't sure how much might actually be true. Now Zack Snyder has spoken out about the spoiler-filled post, although his response doesn't really clear anything up.In a word, to MTV, he called the post \"hilarious,which might imply that he's saying that it's mostly, if not entirely, untrue. That might be the case, but then again he could have just said it was untrue and he didn't say that. What he did say, however, is that he doesn't like spoilers. While this may seem odd for the director who's most recent trailer appeared to give away the entire movie, Snyder says that's not the case. Even if you've seen the trailer, you can rest easy, as there is much more we have not seen in then finished film. Says Snyder I have the benefit of seeing the movie. It's cool that think it's too much, and I appreciate people not wanting to know, but there's plenty that they don't know. There's a lot of movie that's not in the trailer. In the process of calling the Batman v Superman Reddit review hilarious, Snyder goes on to talk about how he hates it when spoilers come out. The director would much rather that fans see the movie mostly blind. While he understands that some fans may wish to find the answers before hand, he wants his movies to be mysteries going in. If you're, as an audience member, exploring these articles, looking for answers to questions that you have, maybe you're okay with knowing before you go. It's like an individual taste. But like I said, I want people to see the movie without knowing.Spoilers are a topic that mean different things to different people. While most try to avoid them to some degree, the need to solve the mystery is a nearly universal human experience. We have an inclination to want to know the truth, even while also wanting to be surprised. For most of us getting some information is good, but getting all the information is bad, of course, only getting the details that you want can be difficult."
"The theatrical is choppy, poorly edited, hard to follow, with some really good moments mixed in their. The extended is much more fluent and is much easier to follow, it does have a long runtime, which might make it seem a bit dragging on, but if you like long films done right, like Lord of the Rings, you will like this movie as long as you get into the characters and story. Speaking of which, the story starts out perfectly showing Bruce Wayne as a character, and it is very powerful. There are several moments in this movie that are powerful, emotional, and shocking. Characters. Batman is my favorite fictional character of all time, and believe me when I say, Ben Affleck as Batman was perfect, he had the charisma, the anger, and the look of being through some bad stuff Gal Gadot also does perfect as Wonder Woman, but if you want to really see how good she does, go watch the Wonder Woman movie. Henry Call as Superman. I really don't like it when people say Christopher Reeves is better. Don't get me wrong, Reeves does great, but can you imagine him as Superman in this movie? I wouldn't like it. It would be like Adam West playing Batman in The Dark Knight. Henry Cavill does great in this role, I can say everything about him as I said with Ben Affleck. Jesse Eisenberg as Luthor. I thought it was different in a good way. I've heard a criticism for him as being too much like Joker, but is that a bad thing? Joker is my favorite villain, so to see Superman have an enemy that crazy, but still hold the values Luthor needs to be Luthor, I think it is great. The thing I thought this movie was lacking in the first and second acts was humor, at least good humor. If there was more humor, I would've given this movie a ten because it would give a more relaxing feel to the parts that needed it. All in all though, this movie was awesome, it had powerful moments, it was badass, and just plain fun. It had a great story arc and does its job very well."

"*I will be talking about the Ultimate Edition of the film* This was one of the most anticipated CBM of all time. Ever since the arrival and subsequent success of Marvel's The Avengers people have wondered when will DC launch its own cinematic universe, one of the main reasons being the opportunity to finally see titans such as Batman and Superman share the screen together: the ultimate nerd dream. On 2016, the moment finally came for BvS to be released AND.. it performed poorly. Not only did critical reception left a lot to be desired, but fan reactions where surprisingly split after its cinematic debut. People either loved it and called Zack a genius, or hated it and called him a hack. Me, personally, I found myself with middle of the road feelings, for sure, but more leaning towards the negative side with subsequent viewings. The theatrical cut of the film showcased amazing performances, incredible visuals, and action set pieces that seemed like comic book panels come to life, in a good way. However, when it comes to its narrative structure and more technical aspects like editing, the film was seriously flawed. More plot holes than Age of Ultron, questionable character decisions, random editing that lacked cohesion and focus, and forced dramatic moments that lacked any impact because the attempts at character development ranged from limited to nonexistent, especially when it comes to Superman's character. I thought it was a 5/10 movie at best. As such, I was kind of skeptical about the idea of a 30 minute longer version. I say kind of because I know how Zack works. I remember Watchmen being vastly improved with its director's cut, so in a way I was expecting BvS to perform in a similar manner, but I also feared those 30 minutes wold be just there to amplify action and discredit storytelling issues. Oh boy, I'm so glad I was proved wrong. The ultimate cut of the film was infuriating, but not because it was awful, but because it questions the sanity of WB executives and editors and makes you wonder what were they thinking during the editing process. What I got out of the Ultimate Edition was a thought-provoking deconstruction of two very iconic superheroes that gave spotlight to the struggles both of them face when they aren't fighting crime. What I got was an extremely well produced character study on both Batman and Superman in a cynical world, a world dangerously close to our own. We meet Batman as a ruthless, worn out hero that has seen the failure behind his ideals and witnessed some truly horrifying things in his life. Superman, on the other hand, is portrayed as a godlike figure that seeks to do good in the world, but finds himself emotionally conflicted once he realized that every good deed he does leaves behind a trail of destruction (most of it due to Luthor's antics). In my opinion, this is a hugely original approach, one that distances itself from the rest of the competition and delivers a dark, somber, yet relevant superhero movie that understands both characters and gives them real human struggles to deal with. I felt invested in both of them, and hoped that by the end of the film both could find a way to redeem themselves. Their character arcs were very well established during the first two acts of the movie, and by the time we get to the titular climactic battle the emotion behind the jaw-dropping action is intensified. Lex Luthor as a villain was also given more time to develop with this new edition. One of the main criticisms with the original version was the fact that his plan relied too much on conveniences, and the character's mannerisms and mad-scientist attitude was annoying, and that goes without saying his motivations were unclear. Not only do we spend more time understanding his hate for any godlike figure and thus his hatred for Superman, but the added scenes allowed us to witness his entire plan come to fruition. It sells the cold, manipulative, calculating attributes of his comic counterpart. The acting is spot on. Every actor owns his/her role, from Cavill's Superman, to Ben Affleck as Batman, Eisenberg as Luthor, and Gadot as Wonder Woman, whose scenes are brief, but are more than enough to sell the strong and ferocious warrior that she is. Cinematography is stunning, and miles above that of Man of Steel's. And the soundtrack by Zimmer and Junkie XL? Perfect, just perfect. When it comes to flaws, the film still has some of those. The Martha moment, while serving as a pivotal character moment for Batman, felt off in execution, and its understandable that many people got mad at it. If your main complaint about BvS the first time around was its bleak tone and subject matter, this film is still not for you. I understand most were expecting to see the heroes being the most iconic versions of themselves, clashing in an elongated battle and evoking the same feelings The Avengers gave audiences back in 2012. In that sense, the film will remain divisive, but at least I have the comfort of saying that, at the very least, the film is competently made."

"This film was amazing. Ben Affleck was easily the best part of this movie, he brought his a-game as Batman. The chemistry between Affleck & Irons was outstanding. Gal Gadot did a great job as Wonder Woman. The fight between Batman & Superman was awesome. The final fight with Doomsday was outstanding in every way possible. However, there is only one problem with this film and that's Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor. He was sadly missed cast in this role, but then again it's really the fault of Warner Bros. Studios. Overall, this film deliver on almost every level. I highly recommend that you watch the extended version of this film."

"I know I know. I saw it in theaters too, and felt like it could've been so much better. While the Batman element was good, the narrative felt fractured, and the third act was just one long stunt scene. Superman was relegated to a supporting character, and other characters didn't get a chance to shine. And then I chanced on the ultimate cut. Calling it 30 mins of \"extra\" footage is unfair to Zack Snyder because it's exactly these 30 mins that makes the movie a worthy one. What I can say about the theatrical cut is this - It had the blockbuster elements - music, visuals, stunts, CGI. But, it lacked the human elements. The first 20 mins of the movie had it, but not after that. The extended cut in comparison has a flow to the narrative. There are no disjointed scenes, everything flows smoothly, and there's connective tissue. Superman gets to spend some time with his father, and mother. Clark Kent does some investigative journalism. Superman helps the people after the blast. Lois Lane doesn't jump to conclusions, she gets to the bottom of the crime. Lex Luthor apparently had a coherent plan - everything is explained pretty well. Wonder Woman was already good, so there's no change there :) Also, the \"Martha\" scene seems better executed, because it is a few seconds longer, and there's time to breathe it in. So, here's my take on this movie - The theatrical cut was junk. Get the Bluray for ultimate edition, and you shall not be disappointed. I've seen it so many more times now, and it's the definitive cut. It is the movie we deserve. It's a unique take on Batman, and Superman. It's a gritty take on the superhero movie genre, and definitely the best DCEU movie, and the best DC movie since The Dark Knight.P.S. Yes it's dark. We're adults, and we should appreciate mature film making without intentionally silly moments. It attempts to be philosophical, and something deep instead of just trying to make you chuckle."

"This is one of the best superhero movies ever made. Zack Snyder is a magician behind the camera.The reason behind so many complaints is the fact that Warner Bros. marketed this movie as a fight between Batman and Superman. That's not what it is. It's a movie about the origins of the Justice League.The cinematography, the acting and the score are all second to none. This film is phenomenal.P.S: watch the 3 hour extended cut that Snyder intended you to see, not the 2 and a half hour movie that Warner Bros. decided would be better for theaters."

"I don't care what the critics say, this is a very well-done movie. I'll start my review by listing what I like about the movie.1.) Ben Affleck is the best batman to me and it is not close. He pulls off the role of an aging batman extremely well. Also, Zack Snyder's vision of batman is legit. I have always hated batman up until this adaptation of him. Instead of being a conflicted and idealistic batman, this batman is dark, gritty, and 100% a badass. His equipment is decked out with machine guns and he has no aversion to killing people. In fact, he probably kills about 50 criminal by the time this movie is over. The warehouse scene is the coolest batman scene in any movie.2.) The development of a grudge between batman and superman is pulled off flawlessly. It actually makes sense why batman dislikes superman. Then, when they do fight it is about the coolest thing you can expect to see from a superhero film. 3.) I disagree with a lot of people about Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor. In my opinion, he played his role to perfection. 4.) B v S sets up Wonder Woman and Justice League with Gal Gadot's cameo as Wonder Woman and short clips of Aquaman, the Flash, and Cyborg. B v S is one of my favorite superhero films and rewatching it never gets old."

"The theatrical cut of this film is garbage which is why I rated it eight stars instead of nine. The first time I watched this film I didn't like it (not straight out hate but didn't like). Character motivations didn't make any sense, Lex was annoying as s***, editing was sloppy, and it was overly dark and broody for an action superhero movie. A year + a half, five Marvel films, a ton of bad reviews and a Justice League later a thought popped into my head: \"what if I watched BVS again\". This time I didn't have trailers ruining the best moments, I only vaguely remembered the film, and I was conditioned to look at it negatively but something unexpected happened: I actually loved it. Superman was just a normal person that tried to make a difference cause he could that others imposed their own beliefs on. Lex Luthor was a genius that couldn't stand his powerlessness compared to Superman or more accurately a super being. As Alfred said \"The fever, the rage, the feeling of powerlessness that turns good men... cruel\" and you see the same thought process in Batman. Batman, just like Lex Luthor feels powerless in the midst of a god-being and just like Lex he attempts to destroy him so he can get his sense of power back but unlike Lex, Batman learns something. I what is one of the corniest lines of the movie Superman says, \"Martha\" when he knows he can't win against Batman in a late desperate attempt to save his mother. Not only does this name connect with Bruce Wayne but it also shows what really matters to a man of steel: it isn't power, it isn't fame or anything else, it is his Mother and on a broader scale it is people. Lex (who doesn't care about people at all) knows he doesn't have the power so he creates something from his blood and the remains of Zod: A Doomsday for Superman. Not only does this film have depth but it also doesn't always explain it to you which is rare in a blockbuster action superhero flick normally cater to semi-comic book fans and people that want to shove popcorn in their mouths. This film rewards you for really noticing the details while still having massive explosions. One of my favorites is how Lex has all of Batman's branded killed which is why he isn't afraid of the branding at the end or Grandma's Peach Tea as a way of scaring the s*** out of someone. Of course, this film isn't perfect and I do have personal dislikes. The Batman V Superman fight was slow and pretty boring especially after watching such an amazing fight in Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 2 (If you haven't watched the animated Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 1 and 2 you are sorely missing out on something fantastic). Also, the addition of Wonder Woman who pretty much steals a hacker thing, gives it back and then suits up and fights against a giant monster thing. Not to say I don't like Wonder Woman (She is one of my favorite Superheroes of all time who showed not only can woman kick a** but they also don't need to be ashamed of their sexuality or gender) but she wasn't really that helpful to the plot and just brought in to expand the universe which was well done through Lex's superhuman hunting files. Also, the post-apocalyptic scene that was just a dream could have been cut but nothing is perfect except movies like Citizen Kane which isn't a lot of fun to watch cause it is too perfect. So to summarize, the theatrical cut is bad, the ultimate cut is Amazing and the other cut is meh. Please give it a second chance because it deserves it and save a good director from losing grace because of something he didn't do."
"I really liked it, don't know what all the hate is about. I'm actually a Marvel fan from when I was 7 or so, but Superman and Batman together in 1 movie? Just great. And personally I like Ben Affleck even better than Christian Bale as Batman. So just watch and enjoy, I know I did!"

"That's right. We have been waiting for these two heroes to finally meet and fight against each other. This movie is so good in both plot and special effects.Henry Cavill and Ben Affleck have performed well in their acting stages. They are the best superhero actors and they have filmed their fighting scenes very well. The movie starts to show the conflict between the lives of the heroes and now they have blamed each other for it. This movie is amazing and sets up a good plot for Dawn Justice."

"Actually...I didn't know what to expect. When you see Wonder Woman, you know it will be off of Wonder Woman and off of a Wonder Woman story, but with Batman V Superman, I was like, \"hmmmm, so who is this about?\" It was pretty obvious that it would feature many characters, but I thought the introduction to Batman was amazing. Ben Affleck nailed the part, not only as Batman but also as Bruce Wayne. He is my Batman. Henry Cavill continued to be super as the Man of Steel. And he is my Super - Man. A dark story? Yes, without a doubt. Could it have had a few more jokes? Sure. But not all movies or stories need to have jokes when certain events are serious. I really hope people can see this review and take another look at the movie, because, I loved it. I really hope the ratings can go up, eventually. And P.S, this movie is the perfect set up to Justice League."

"I'll start by making it clear I have only ever seen the Ultimate Edition. I'm aware of what was cut out for the theatrical release, so I will concede up front that most of the criticisms about pacing, editing, and missing bits of plot at release were merited.With that caveat out of the way, I must reiterate that this was bar-none the boldest superhero movie I have ever seen. To me, it was arguably the best as well, though \"best\" shouldn't be taken to mean \"most enjoyable.\" That honor easily goes to \"Thor: Ragnarok.\" What makes BvS stand out among other films in the genre is that it takes two characters who have been done to death since the 1970s and brings them up to date. I recently tried to watch \"Superman: The Movie\" for the first time in a number of years, and while it was still good and Reeves will always be iconic, I just couldn't take it seriously. I'll put it this way: If the story in BvS was \"stupid\" in your view but Superman turning back time by spinning the earth backward on its axis didn't seem like one of the dumbest things you have ever seen -in any movie from any genre- to the extent that it outright ruins the movie for you, then your opinion about BvS isn't worth much. Nostalgic bias was always going to be a problem for this movie, and the way people reacted to and reviewed \"Man of Steel\" was telling in this regard.That brings me to Zack Snyder's take on Superman. You know, that guy whose status as the first extraterrestrial ever encountered by humanity was a total non-issue in the old movies. Apparently, Snyder has a similar view to my own in that his take on the Man of Steel makes his being an alien a core piece of his identity. He may look like any other (absurdly attractive) person, but he knows what he is, and that makes him perpetually uncertain of where he fits in this world. He is essentially good and really does care about people, but he struggles to truly empathize with the likes of us. To be human is to be frail, and that is not something he can easily relate to. This is the root of his conflict with Batman.Just as Clark struggles to genuinely relate to most people, Snyder's Batman either refuses to or otherwise just can't relate to Superman. He doesn't see him as anything but a threat regardless of Superman's clear good intentions. Remember, a small group of Kryptonians were able to bring humanity to the brink of extinction in less than a day, and Bruce Wayne is nothing if not a realist. He didn't know the guy from Kansas. He only knew the god from another world.While Batman's anger toward and fear of Superman are readily apparent from the start, Superman's inability to imagine things from Bruce Wayne's perspective only becomes truly apparent during their first real interaction. This reminded me of the animated version of the \"world's finest\" storyline, where Superman judges Batman harshly for using fear tactics and threats of violence (also, actual violence) to get the job done. Superman wasn't willing to consider what it would take for a human man to fight criminals and save innocents, or what that life would do to him over time. Just as Batman didn't see the guy from Kansas, Superman didn't see the man who lives his life trapped in one brutal, unthinkably traumatic moment (this was beautifully conveyed during the film's opening moments), and had spent his whole adult life bearing witness to humanity at its absolute worst.The conflict between these two characters is as old as human history. They want the same things, but they can't understand one another. So they fight. And what a fight it was.Watching a fight between, say, Captain America and Iron Man was, to me, more frustrating than anything because each understood the other's perspective perfectly. The fight between Batman and Superman in BvS was genuinely gut-wrenching, as intended, because they would have understood one another if either had tried. The whole sequence hilighted Batman's tactical prowess and ability to control a situation. Maybe the most badass thing about the fight was that it ended exactly where Batman planned. That brings me to the big elephant in the room named \"Martha.\"I can't recall exactly which YouTuber put it this way, but if you thought the \"save Martha\" exchange was about their mothers having the same name, you had your brain turned off. The brain-on people have explained this to death, but it bears repeating. This was the moment when Superman became humanized to Batman. He was about to die, and his only concern was for his adoptive human mother. He still believed that the man about to take his life would do the right thing. Even with the cowl on, there was no mistaking the look on Batman's face. It was the look of shame, guilt, and sudden uncertainty that says \"What am I doing?\" Turns out even the most brutal, angry version of Bruce Wayne is better than Tony Stark at knowing right from wrong. At knowing that he had gone too far.From there, the third act was a series of truly impressive (albeit mostly CGI) fight sequences, beginning with what I regard as the undisputed champion of Batman fights. Nothing in the Nolan movies (and especially nothing in the Burton movies) even came close. Go ahead, try to convince yourself that Batman and Bane taking turns punching one another in the face until Bane's mask broke was a good fight sequence. No, this was a fight straight out of \"Arkham Knight,\" and it was glorious. The battle against Doomsday really was one for the books. From the moment Wonder Woman arrived accompanied by the intense sounds of Tina Guo's electric cello to Superman's tragic, heroic death at the hands of Doomsday, I was glued to the screen. Sure, the mere presence of Doomsday spoiled the end to a degree, but watching the Man of Steel laboring to carry that kryptonite spear towards certain death was no less impactful. A brief word on Jesse Eisenberg's take on Lex Luthor. At least one other reviewer on this site already said it best when they pointed out that this was his origin story. If you consider his scheme objectively, he is actually one of the more formidable incarnations of the character. If we're lucky, we'll eventually get to see a Snyder Cut of \"Justice League\" and find out where this story was actually meant to go. For the record, Joss Whedon and Danny Elfman both should have said \"no\" to taking a dump on someone else's art."
"BATMAN V SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE brings a fantastic surprise to a smash-hit team-up with one of the worlds most beloved DC Comics' icons of all time. The movie delivers spectacular casting, and fantastic acting with different characters having their shine in each scenes.The story follows Clark Kent/Superman who becomes a threat, after the destruction in Metropolis in Man Of Steel.(2013). Batman/Bruce Wayne sees him as a threat and begins his war on Superman.The movie brings spectacular storytelling, it tells the complications of human against alien who are on the same side, and the first meeting of Batman and Superman. The story of Bruce Wayne, with his many years of The Caped Crusader, sends him on a spiral of \"out of control\", sheer anger, and builds tension to wanting to defeat the Man of Steel. Snyder has fantastically gave this storytelling an exciting nod to the comics.Lex Luthor, played by Jesse Einsberg, delivers a very interesting performance, but very differently by him showing is his \"origin\" before he becomes a bald foe to the Man of Steel. He shows that his love of \"god vs man\" terrorises mankind when he ultimately creates Doomsday, and Batman realises Superman's inner heroism.It packs so many great \"out of nowhere\" excitement, including a first-look of the fearful Wonder Woman a.k.a. Diana Prince, played by Gal Gadot, and a fresh-new glimpse of the superhero DC canon: The Justice League.WATCH THIS MOVIE! The critics are out of their mind. It's a fun-packed action adventure which still keeps the movie enjoyable until it's final minutes of the movie. It's a FANTASTIC MOVIE! BEN AFFLECK AS BATMAN... is Incredible!A 10/10 overall!"
"I want to go on record as saying that this is a truly thrilling cinematic experience in so many ways. If pressed, I guess I could acknowledge that there were a couple ... let's say \"clumsy\" moments. And in a film that runs to three hours, that hardly seems like a significant issue, certainly not enough to rate it with fewer than 9 stars.This film has everything. There is dramatic tension right from the start. There is a magnificent story arc that picks up quite seamlessly from 'Man of Steel' and propels the viewer not only into the life of Clark Kent/Superman but also of Bruce Wayne/Batman.The villain is no mere cartoon of a villain; he is truly thoroughly (and apparently irrevocably) diabolical. He is a psychopath, and you wish for his death over and over and over. You want Superman to reduce him to ash with the power of his eyes.I have read a number of viewers' reviews, and it seems that the people who disliked the film / gave it a low rating had rather unfair and unrealistic expectations of it. That is, their own prejudices about how the plot could/should unfold or what the character development could/should be, etc. ruined the film for them. And that is a shame.My thought is: I settle into my seat, wait for the lights to dim, and then I wait to be transported by the film. I accept it, lock, stock, and barrel.As another reviewer remarked, I love how the film begins from the point of view of Bruce Wayne as he is among people on the ground who have fallen victim to the attack of Zod and the other Kryptonians.Why would Bruce Wayne not like Superman? Why would the good people of Earth hurl insults at Superman and burn him in effigy (on the news)? Because the good people of Earth just got catapulted into a new reality in which there are not only extraterrestrial beings (surprise!) but they are also superman! And a group of them are hell-bent on destroying humankind and taking the planet for themselves.It is difficult to see Superman as separate from the whole Kryptonian Krew.It seems that many moviegoers forgot that Bruce Wayne is also human. Sure, he's a hero, but he is flawed.. Just like the rest of us. He is a vigilante, after all.He has let his vigilantism get the better of him. HE is actually the one working outside the boundaries of the law, not Superman. It is the clear head of Alfred that shows us that he has gone into a rather dark place, that he has not seen what is really going on (in Luthor's scheme), and so he chooses to embark on his own scheme scheme to take out the alien invader. He is (allegedly) thinking of the future: if he wipes out the all-powerful alien, then it can't turn on humankind in the future. At least, he convinces himself of that.A philosophical question is raised in the film: should Clark Kent have remained a simple man from Kansas and never have become the Superman? Should he just let people die and let calamities happen? The question is answered for us in the character of Diana Prince/Wonder Woman. She withdrew from mankind (her exact words) and just sat around watching. Watching while people died horrible deaths all around her. So, should Superman have done the same? Do these special beings, these 'metahumans', have some kind of moral imperative to intervene, or should they be allowed to be regular people, too? It seems that humans want it both ways.It seems that humans are saying: \"Don't be a superalien ... except when I and my friends and family are in trouble. Then come save us.\""

"Batman v Superman: Ultimate Edition: If your looking for a quick, cheap thrill then you might not enjoy this film at the time. This movies theatrical version was butchered by WB and in doing so reshaped the story leaving numerous plot holes. So the Ultimate Edition is the full story and the one worth seeing. Watch 'Man of Steel' before seeing this movie. There is much to claw through here, so much so that the audience might easily find themselves exhausted from the overall aggression of the film. However, a lot of the story does work. The action is good, and the emotion feels real most of the time.This film is about Superman trying to become Superman. Trying to help the world, save people, find a place in this world not as an outcast, and yet is looked at has a threat by many. Superman is not from this world, yet He is trying to be human, find a place in this world, be excepted by earths people, and come into his destiny.This film is also about Batman being Batman for 20 years and losing faith in humanity, and fearing Superman, what Superman can do with his powers. Great film, great plot, great visuals. ---Yidioo"
"I didn't see the film in the theaters and just bought the \"Extended Edition \" on Amazon. I never properly saw Man of Steel- i think I rented it and watched it when already exhausted and fell asleep. I saw the mediocre user reviews and horrible reviews from critics of this film.They really have it wrong. This is the very best either Batman or Superman. It has a different take, on things. Much darker then earlier films even darker then the Christopher Nolan Batman films.First of all Christopher Nolan is an Executive Producer. So how bad could it be? I loved Sucker Punch and Zack Snyder was involved with that. So how bad could this be? Hans Zimmer did the music, so how bad could it be?I remember watching the old Superman TV shows and reading the Superman and Batman comics as a little kid and loved them, but i wouldn't call myself a \"fan boy\" of comic universes, like so many younger people today. As an older adult I will admit my favorite TV show of all time was Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but watched it on DVD only after it had finished. I saw the second of the Dark Knight series in the theater, but the other two, I watched on DVD. They were great, but not my favorite films like so many people. i also loved the first couple Superman and Batman films in the older series. Regardless, i was not waiting with baited breath to see Man of Steel or this one.I'm more of a serious film fan, who can watch Stanley Kubrick films over and over and my favorite films in the last twenty years, are Eyes Wide Shut and Intersteller, both of which i've watched multiple times.So, with that said, take it from me, the critics have this film very wrong, just as critics hated 2001: A Space Odyssey when it first came out. This film will have lasting appreciation.Surprised how much I liked Ben Afleck's Batman. it was hard to get into Henry Cavil's scrawnier looking Superman, but it grew on me. Amy Adams was great as Lois Lane, The Gal Gadol Wonder Women was amazing. Lex Luther was terrific, like Nolan's Joker. Jeremy Irons was the best Alfred ever. Holly Hunter and Diane Lane was good too. The movie had bad reviews but made a billion dollars. Hopefully everyone buys the Ultimate Edition and it breaks sales records and the film is re-appreciated. I have no idea what scenes this Ultimate Edition added, but it is pretty perfect. Now I can't wait for Wonder Woman and the Justice League and as soon as I finish writing this am going to watch Man of Steal. I'm into it now!I can only surmise that the bad reviews stem from too much expectations of the rigid fan boy types and the radical changes in tone, we see in this film.Total masterpiece of cinema, but I have a few criticisms. There are a few hollow scenes of typical Idiot cops and authorities getting everything wrong in a cliché type way and it has a few filler scenes of that type and a few moments here and there that felt rushed and cheesy. Maybe not everything restored into the Ultimate Edition should have been. I wish there had been more Kevin Costner scenes."

"The whole entire Batman V Superman movie was great and yes even though it felt slow to the majority of the people who watched it but to me I enjoyed every part and every scene of Batman V Superman and when it got to the fight scenes both batman VS Superman and the Doomsday fight it brought so much drama, intensity, and epic performances. So with that being said I give this movie a good 10/10 because it really did go to my expectations and it brought a powerful performance and a powerful yet epic introduction to the upcoming Justice League."

"When I first wrote a review for this movie a year ago exclaiming my excitement for the film, I had been high off a fresh dose of live-action DC superheroes playing out the beloved comic book stories that I had grown up on. It was all playing out before my eyes and coming to life. After a few months had passed, I began to notice things about the movie that I disliked: little gaps in the story, things that didn't add up, etc. My original rating of a 10 / 10 dropped to an 8 /10. But today it has gone back up to a 10. The extended version of the film not only rectifies the gaps but also silences critics.Many claimed that the movie was too dark or that it just didn't make sense. To those people, I say: \"Pick up a comic book!\" Many of the critics of this particular film were part of the superhero bandwagon that formed when Marvel began its spree of Avengers-related films. In fact, its estimated that over 60% of people who go to see 'superhero' genre films have never picked up a comic book in their life. I would argue that similar numbers could figure to those which view the CW televised DC Universe shows. People complain that DC comics is just too dark but the fact is that these movies are based upon actual comics which are meant to be dark (ex: The Dark Knight Returns, Injustice, etc.). Its like complaining that Game of Thrones (the TV series) sucks because they kill off too many characters. Read the books! Its frustrating to see such a beautiful work of art like Batman V Superman criticized by those ignorant to its universe and its meaning. This movie is in fact a catalyst that opens numerous doorways and leaves true fans in awe of the possibilities for future movies. But regardless of whether or not people choose to educate themselves, this film's DVD/Blu-ray extended version puts the theater release to shame. All of the plot holes and gaps are filled in 30 minutes of extended footage scattered throughout the film. The movie ultimately becomes more complete and people will wish that the movie had shown the full 3 hours of footage in its theatrical debut. As a major DC comics fan, I will of course pick up on things that a comics fan would not, but someone who does not read comics would learn to appreciate this film in its entirety with the extended version. Get your hands on a copy today or find it on Netflix or the internet somewhere!"

"I ignored the bad reviews and watched anyways. This film had a lot to live up to after Civil War was released and I went into this film expecting the worst. It ended up to be the best Superhero film of 2016 to me. One complaint was that this film was more concerned about universe building than telling a great story than Civil War but for me it was the other way around; Civil War felt like a build up to something else and to be honest, I felt that way when I saw the other MCU films. Batman vs Superman however not only had a great story, but it also felt a lot more consistent than Civil War. This film was way more diverse with the cast than the MCU but unlike the MCU, I felt like this film doesn't go overboard with the SJW stuff like the MCU films or The Star Wars Sequel films do. The Visuals were AMAZING, The Score by Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL was AMAZING as well, The Tone is just right as I actually felt for the characters emotionally, The Cinematography kept my eyes glued to the screen, and the script felt really Intelligent and Complex and despite people calling the writing confusing, I was able to piece it together with no problem whatsoever. This film is similar to Empire Strikes back in terms of popularity so over time after the other movies are released, this movie would probably be more popular.This film was way better than I Expected and deserves another chance.

"Its shame to see what critics and marvel fans did to this movie and targeted Zack Snyder for it. I have seen this movie more than 25 times till date. And i enjoy this movie as much as i enjoyed the first time. The fans who have read DC comics, wouldn't be disappointed in this movie. Its dark movie, yes it is. Because the title shows the intense situation at hand. Two superheroes about to rip each other apart for whatever reasons that brought them to this stage. Yes it had to be dark and intense.Only marvel can be stupid enough to show an alien invasion where humans are loosing the battle and the super heroes are cracking jokes while battles as if they are playing ping pong. a person playing Call of Duty game is more serious while playing than the marvel heroes fighting aliens."

"Last week some news came out from somebody online who had claimed to have seen a finished version of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. If you were like me, you've been leery of checking it out because you weren't sure how much might actually be true. Now Zack Snyder has spoken out about the spoiler-filled post, although his response doesn't really clear anything up.In a word, to MTV, he called the post \"hilarious,which might imply that he's saying that it's mostly, if not entirely, untrue. That might be the case, but then again he could have just said it was untrue and he didn't say that. What he did say, however, is that he doesn't like spoilers. While this may seem odd for the director who's most recent trailer appeared to give away the entire movie, Snyder says that's not the case. Even if you've seen the trailer, you can rest easy, as there is much more we have not seen in then finished film. Says Snyder I have the benefit of seeing the movie. It's cool that think it's too much, and I appreciate people not wanting to know, but there's plenty that they don't know. There's a lot of movie that's not in the trailer. In the process of calling the Batman v Superman Reddit review hilarious, Snyder goes on to talk about how he hates it when spoilers come out. The director would much rather that fans see the movie mostly blind. While he understands that some fans may wish to find the answers before hand, he wants his movies to be mysteries going in. If you're, as an audience member, exploring these articles, looking for answers to questions that you have, maybe you're okay with knowing before you go. It's like an individual taste. But like I said, I want people to see the movie without knowing.Spoilers are a topic that mean different things to different people. While most try to avoid them to some degree, the need to solve the mystery is a nearly universal human experience. We have an inclination to want to know the truth, even while also wanting to be surprised. For most of us getting some information is good, but getting all the information is bad, of course, only getting the details that you want can be difficult."
"The theatrical is choppy, poorly edited, hard to follow, with some really good moments mixed in their. The extended is much more fluent and is much easier to follow, it does have a long runtime, which might make it seem a bit dragging on, but if you like long films done right, like Lord of the Rings, you will like this movie as long as you get into the characters and story. Speaking of which, the story starts out perfectly showing Bruce Wayne as a character, and it is very powerful. There are several moments in this movie that are powerful, emotional, and shocking. Characters. Batman is my favorite fictional character of all time, and believe me when I say, Ben Affleck as Batman was perfect, he had the charisma, the anger, and the look of being through some bad stuff Gal Gadot also does perfect as Wonder Woman, but if you want to really see how good she does, go watch the Wonder Woman movie. Henry Call as Superman. I really don't like it when people say Christopher Reeves is better. Don't get me wrong, Reeves does great, but can you imagine him as Superman in this movie? I wouldn't like it. It would be like Adam West playing Batman in The Dark Knight. Henry Cavill does great in this role, I can say everything about him as I said with Ben Affleck. Jesse Eisenberg as Luthor. I thought it was different in a good way. I've heard a criticism for him as being too much like Joker, but is that a bad thing? Joker is my favorite villain, so to see Superman have an enemy that crazy, but still hold the values Luthor needs to be Luthor, I think it is great. The thing I thought this movie was lacking in the first and second acts was humor, at least good humor. If there was more humor, I would've given this movie a ten because it would give a more relaxing feel to the parts that needed it. All in all though, this movie was awesome, it had powerful moments, it was badass, and just plain fun. It had a great story arc and does its job very well."

"*I will be talking about the Ultimate Edition of the film* This was one of the most anticipated CBM of all time. Ever since the arrival and subsequent success of Marvel's The Avengers people have wondered when will DC launch its own cinematic universe, one of the main reasons being the opportunity to finally see titans such as Batman and Superman share the screen together: the ultimate nerd dream. On 2016, the moment finally came for BvS to be released AND.. it performed poorly. Not only did critical reception left a lot to be desired, but fan reactions where surprisingly split after its cinematic debut. People either loved it and called Zack a genius, or hated it and called him a hack. Me, personally, I found myself with middle of the road feelings, for sure, but more leaning towards the negative side with subsequent viewings. The theatrical cut of the film showcased amazing performances, incredible visuals, and action set pieces that seemed like comic book panels come to life, in a good way. However, when it comes to its narrative structure and more technical aspects like editing, the film was seriously flawed. More plot holes than Age of Ultron, questionable character decisions, random editing that lacked cohesion and focus, and forced dramatic moments that lacked any impact because the attempts at character development ranged from limited to nonexistent, especially when it comes to Superman's character. I thought it was a 5/10 movie at best. As such, I was kind of skeptical about the idea of a 30 minute longer version. I say kind of because I know how Zack works. I remember Watchmen being vastly improved with its director's cut, so in a way I was expecting BvS to perform in a similar manner, but I also feared those 30 minutes wold be just there to amplify action and discredit storytelling issues. Oh boy, I'm so glad I was proved wrong. The ultimate cut of the film was infuriating, but not because it was awful, but because it questions the sanity of WB executives and editors and makes you wonder what were they thinking during the editing process. What I got out of the Ultimate Edition was a thought-provoking deconstruction of two very iconic superheroes that gave spotlight to the struggles both of them face when they aren't fighting crime. What I got was an extremely well produced character study on both Batman and Superman in a cynical world, a world dangerously close to our own. We meet Batman as a ruthless, worn out hero that has seen the failure behind his ideals and witnessed some truly horrifying things in his life. Superman, on the other hand, is portrayed as a godlike figure that seeks to do good in the world, but finds himself emotionally conflicted once he realized that every good deed he does leaves behind a trail of destruction (most of it due to Luthor's antics). In my opinion, this is a hugely original approach, one that distances itself from the rest of the competition and delivers a dark, somber, yet relevant superhero movie that understands both characters and gives them real human struggles to deal with. I felt invested in both of them, and hoped that by the end of the film both could find a way to redeem themselves. Their character arcs were very well established during the first two acts of the movie, and by the time we get to the titular climactic battle the emotion behind the jaw-dropping action is intensified. Lex Luthor as a villain was also given more time to develop with this new edition. One of the main criticisms with the original version was the fact that his plan relied too much on conveniences, and the character's mannerisms and mad-scientist attitude was annoying, and that goes without saying his motivations were unclear. Not only do we spend more time understanding his hate for any godlike figure and thus his hatred for Superman, but the added scenes allowed us to witness his entire plan come to fruition. It sells the cold, manipulative, calculating attributes of his comic counterpart. The acting is spot on. Every actor owns his/her role, from Cavill's Superman, to Ben Affleck as Batman, Eisenberg as Luthor, and Gadot as Wonder Woman, whose scenes are brief, but are more than enough to sell the strong and ferocious warrior that she is. Cinematography is stunning, and miles above that of Man of Steel's. And the soundtrack by Zimmer and Junkie XL? Perfect, just perfect. When it comes to flaws, the film still has some of those. The Martha moment, while serving as a pivotal character moment for Batman, felt off in execution, and its understandable that many people got mad at it. If your main complaint about BvS the first time around was its bleak tone and subject matter, this film is still not for you. I understand most were expecting to see the heroes being the most iconic versions of themselves, clashing in an elongated battle and evoking the same feelings The Avengers gave audiences back in 2012. In that sense, the film will remain divisive, but at least I have the comfort of saying that, at the very least, the film is competently made."

"This film was amazing. Ben Affleck was easily the best part of this movie, he brought his a-game as Batman. The chemistry between Affleck & Irons was outstanding. Gal Gadot did a great job as Wonder Woman. The fight between Batman & Superman was awesome. The final fight with Doomsday was outstanding in every way possible. However, there is only one problem with this film and that's Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor. He was sadly missed cast in this role, but then again it's really the fault of Warner Bros. Studios. Overall, this film deliver on almost every level. I highly recommend that you watch the extended version of this film."

"I know I know. I saw it in theaters too, and felt like it could've been so much better. While the Batman element was good, the narrative felt fractured, and the third act was just one long stunt scene. Superman was relegated to a supporting character, and other characters didn't get a chance to shine. And then I chanced on the ultimate cut. Calling it 30 mins of \"extra\" footage is unfair to Zack Snyder because it's exactly these 30 mins that makes the movie a worthy one. What I can say about the theatrical cut is this - It had the blockbuster elements - music, visuals, stunts, CGI. But, it lacked the human elements. The first 20 mins of the movie had it, but not after that. The extended cut in comparison has a flow to the narrative. There are no disjointed scenes, everything flows smoothly, and there's connective tissue. Superman gets to spend some time with his father, and mother. Clark Kent does some investigative journalism. Superman helps the people after the blast. Lois Lane doesn't jump to conclusions, she gets to the bottom of the crime. Lex Luthor apparently had a coherent plan - everything is explained pretty well. Wonder Woman was already good, so there's no change there :) Also, the \"Martha\" scene seems better executed, because it is a few seconds longer, and there's time to breathe it in. So, here's my take on this movie - The theatrical cut was junk. Get the Bluray for ultimate edition, and you shall not be disappointed. I've seen it so many more times now, and it's the definitive cut. It is the movie we deserve. It's a unique take on Batman, and Superman. It's a gritty take on the superhero movie genre, and definitely the best DCEU movie, and the best DC movie since The Dark Knight.P.S. Yes it's dark. We're adults, and we should appreciate mature film making without intentionally silly moments. It attempts to be philosophical, and something deep instead of just trying to make you chuckle."

"This is one of the best superhero movies ever made. Zack Snyder is a magician behind the camera.The reason behind so many complaints is the fact that Warner Bros. marketed this movie as a fight between Batman and Superman. That's not what it is. It's a movie about the origins of the Justice League.The cinematography, the acting and the score are all second to none. This film is phenomenal.P.S: watch the 3 hour extended cut that Snyder intended you to see, not the 2 and a half hour movie that Warner Bros. decided would be better for theaters."

"I don't care what the critics say, this is a very well-done movie. I'll start my review by listing what I like about the movie.1.) Ben Affleck is the best batman to me and it is not close. He pulls off the role of an aging batman extremely well. Also, Zack Snyder's vision of batman is legit. I have always hated batman up until this adaptation of him. Instead of being a conflicted and idealistic batman, this batman is dark, gritty, and 100% a badass. His equipment is decked out with machine guns and he has no aversion to killing people. In fact, he probably kills about 50 criminal by the time this movie is over. The warehouse scene is the coolest batman scene in any movie.2.) The development of a grudge between batman and superman is pulled off flawlessly. It actually makes sense why batman dislikes superman. Then, when they do fight it is about the coolest thing you can expect to see from a superhero film. 3.) I disagree with a lot of people about Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor. In my opinion, he played his role to perfection. 4.) B v S sets up Wonder Woman and Justice League with Gal Gadot's cameo as Wonder Woman and short clips of Aquaman, the Flash, and Cyborg. B v S is one of my favorite superhero films and rewatching it never gets old."

"The theatrical cut of this film is garbage which is why I rated it eight stars instead of nine. The first time I watched this film I didn't like it (not straight out hate but didn't like). Character motivations didn't make any sense, Lex was annoying as s***, editing was sloppy, and it was overly dark and broody for an action superhero movie. A year + a half, five Marvel films, a ton of bad reviews and a Justice League later a thought popped into my head: \"what if I watched BVS again\". This time I didn't have trailers ruining the best moments, I only vaguely remembered the film, and I was conditioned to look at it negatively but something unexpected happened: I actually loved it. Superman was just a normal person that tried to make a difference cause he could that others imposed their own beliefs on. Lex Luthor was a genius that couldn't stand his powerlessness compared to Superman or more accurately a super being. As Alfred said \"The fever, the rage, the feeling of powerlessness that turns good men... cruel\" and you see the same thought process in Batman. Batman, just like Lex Luthor feels powerless in the midst of a god-being and just like Lex he attempts to destroy him so he can get his sense of power back but unlike Lex, Batman learns something. I what is one of the corniest lines of the movie Superman says, \"Martha\" when he knows he can't win against Batman in a late desperate attempt to save his mother. Not only does this name connect with Bruce Wayne but it also shows what really matters to a man of steel: it isn't power, it isn't fame or anything else, it is his Mother and on a broader scale it is people. Lex (who doesn't care about people at all) knows he doesn't have the power so he creates something from his blood and the remains of Zod: A Doomsday for Superman. Not only does this film have depth but it also doesn't always explain it to you which is rare in a blockbuster action superhero flick normally cater to semi-comic book fans and people that want to shove popcorn in their mouths. This film rewards you for really noticing the details while still having massive explosions. One of my favorites is how Lex has all of Batman's branded killed which is why he isn't afraid of the branding at the end or Grandma's Peach Tea as a way of scaring the s*** out of someone. Of course, this film isn't perfect and I do have personal dislikes. The Batman V Superman fight was slow and pretty boring especially after watching such an amazing fight in Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 2 (If you haven't watched the animated Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 1 and 2 you are sorely missing out on something fantastic). Also, the addition of Wonder Woman who pretty much steals a hacker thing, gives it back and then suits up and fights against a giant monster thing. Not to say I don't like Wonder Woman (She is one of my favorite Superheroes of all time who showed not only can woman kick a** but they also don't need to be ashamed of their sexuality or gender) but she wasn't really that helpful to the plot and just brought in to expand the universe which was well done through Lex's superhuman hunting files. Also, the post-apocalyptic scene that was just a dream could have been cut but nothing is perfect except movies like Citizen Kane which isn't a lot of fun to watch cause it is too perfect. So to summarize, the theatrical cut is bad, the ultimate cut is Amazing and the other cut is meh. Please give it a second chance because it deserves it and save a good director from losing grace because of something he didn't do."
"I really liked it, don't know what all the hate is about. I'm actually a Marvel fan from when I was 7 or so, but Superman and Batman together in 1 movie? Just great. And personally I like Ben Affleck even better than Christian Bale as Batman. So just watch and enjoy, I know I did!"

"That's right. We have been waiting for these two heroes to finally meet and fight against each other. This movie is so good in both plot and special effects.Henry Cavill and Ben Affleck have performed well in their acting stages. They are the best superhero actors and they have filmed their fighting scenes very well. The movie starts to show the conflict between the lives of the heroes and now they have blamed each other for it. This movie is amazing and sets up a good plot for Dawn Justice."

"Actually...I didn't know what to expect. When you see Wonder Woman, you know it will be off of Wonder Woman and off of a Wonder Woman story, but with Batman V Superman, I was like, \"hmmmm, so who is this about?\" It was pretty obvious that it would feature many characters, but I thought the introduction to Batman was amazing. Ben Affleck nailed the part, not only as Batman but also as Bruce Wayne. He is my Batman. Henry Cavill continued to be super as the Man of Steel. And he is my Super - Man. A dark story? Yes, without a doubt. Could it have had a few more jokes? Sure. But not all movies or stories need to have jokes when certain events are serious. I really hope people can see this review and take another look at the movie, because, I loved it. I really hope the ratings can go up, eventually. And P.S, this movie is the perfect set up to Justice League."

"I'll start by making it clear I have only ever seen the Ultimate Edition. I'm aware of what was cut out for the theatrical release, so I will concede up front that most of the criticisms about pacing, editing, and missing bits of plot at release were merited.With that caveat out of the way, I must reiterate that this was bar-none the boldest superhero movie I have ever seen. To me, it was arguably the best as well, though \"best\" shouldn't be taken to mean \"most enjoyable.\" That honor easily goes to \"Thor: Ragnarok.\" What makes BvS stand out among other films in the genre is that it takes two characters who have been done to death since the 1970s and brings them up to date. I recently tried to watch \"Superman: The Movie\" for the first time in a number of years, and while it was still good and Reeves will always be iconic, I just couldn't take it seriously. I'll put it this way: If the story in BvS was \"stupid\" in your view but Superman turning back time by spinning the earth backward on its axis didn't seem like one of the dumbest things you have ever seen -in any movie from any genre- to the extent that it outright ruins the movie for you, then your opinion about BvS isn't worth much. Nostalgic bias was always going to be a problem for this movie, and the way people reacted to and reviewed \"Man of Steel\" was telling in this regard.That brings me to Zack Snyder's take on Superman. You know, that guy whose status as the first extraterrestrial ever encountered by humanity was a total non-issue in the old movies. Apparently, Snyder has a similar view to my own in that his take on the Man of Steel makes his being an alien a core piece of his identity. He may look like any other (absurdly attractive) person, but he knows what he is, and that makes him perpetually uncertain of where he fits in this world. He is essentially good and really does care about people, but he struggles to truly empathize with the likes of us. To be human is to be frail, and that is not something he can easily relate to. This is the root of his conflict with Batman.Just as Clark struggles to genuinely relate to most people, Snyder's Batman either refuses to or otherwise just can't relate to Superman. He doesn't see him as anything but a threat regardless of Superman's clear good intentions. Remember, a small group of Kryptonians were able to bring humanity to the brink of extinction in less than a day, and Bruce Wayne is nothing if not a realist. He didn't know the guy from Kansas. He only knew the god from another world.While Batman's anger toward and fear of Superman are readily apparent from the start, Superman's inability to imagine things from Bruce Wayne's perspective only becomes truly apparent during their first real interaction. This reminded me of the animated version of the \"world's finest\" storyline, where Superman judges Batman harshly for using fear tactics and threats of violence (also, actual violence) to get the job done. Superman wasn't willing to consider what it would take for a human man to fight criminals and save innocents, or what that life would do to him over time. Just as Batman didn't see the guy from Kansas, Superman didn't see the man who lives his life trapped in one brutal, unthinkably traumatic moment (this was beautifully conveyed during the film's opening moments), and had spent his whole adult life bearing witness to humanity at its absolute worst.The conflict between these two characters is as old as human history. They want the same things, but they can't understand one another. So they fight. And what a fight it was.Watching a fight between, say, Captain America and Iron Man was, to me, more frustrating than anything because each understood the other's perspective perfectly. The fight between Batman and Superman in BvS was genuinely gut-wrenching, as intended, because they would have understood one another if either had tried. The whole sequence hilighted Batman's tactical prowess and ability to control a situation. Maybe the most badass thing about the fight was that it ended exactly where Batman planned. That brings me to the big elephant in the room named \"Martha.\"I can't recall exactly which YouTuber put it this way, but if you thought the \"save Martha\" exchange was about their mothers having the same name, you had your brain turned off. The brain-on people have explained this to death, but it bears repeating. This was the moment when Superman became humanized to Batman. He was about to die, and his only concern was for his adoptive human mother. He still believed that the man about to take his life would do the right thing. Even with the cowl on, there was no mistaking the look on Batman's face. It was the look of shame, guilt, and sudden uncertainty that says \"What am I doing?\" Turns out even the most brutal, angry version of Bruce Wayne is better than Tony Stark at knowing right from wrong. At knowing that he had gone too far.From there, the third act was a series of truly impressive (albeit mostly CGI) fight sequences, beginning with what I regard as the undisputed champion of Batman fights. Nothing in the Nolan movies (and especially nothing in the Burton movies) even came close. Go ahead, try to convince yourself that Batman and Bane taking turns punching one another in the face until Bane's mask broke was a good fight sequence. No, this was a fight straight out of \"Arkham Knight,\" and it was glorious. The battle against Doomsday really was one for the books. From the moment Wonder Woman arrived accompanied by the intense sounds of Tina Guo's electric cello to Superman's tragic, heroic death at the hands of Doomsday, I was glued to the screen. Sure, the mere presence of Doomsday spoiled the end to a degree, but watching the Man of Steel laboring to carry that kryptonite spear towards certain death was no less impactful. A brief word on Jesse Eisenberg's take on Lex Luthor. At least one other reviewer on this site already said it best when they pointed out that this was his origin story. If you consider his scheme objectively, he is actually one of the more formidable incarnations of the character. If we're lucky, we'll eventually get to see a Snyder Cut of \"Justice League\" and find out where this story was actually meant to go. For the record, Joss Whedon and Danny Elfman both should have said \"no\" to taking a dump on someone else's art."
"BATMAN V SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE brings a fantastic surprise to a smash-hit team-up with one of the worlds most beloved DC Comics' icons of all time. The movie delivers spectacular casting, and fantastic acting with different characters having their shine in each scenes.The story follows Clark Kent/Superman who becomes a threat, after the destruction in Metropolis in Man Of Steel.(2013). Batman/Bruce Wayne sees him as a threat and begins his war on Superman.The movie brings spectacular storytelling, it tells the complications of human against alien who are on the same side, and the first meeting of Batman and Superman. The story of Bruce Wayne, with his many years of The Caped Crusader, sends him on a spiral of \"out of control\", sheer anger, and builds tension to wanting to defeat the Man of Steel. Snyder has fantastically gave this storytelling an exciting nod to the comics.Lex Luthor, played by Jesse Einsberg, delivers a very interesting performance, but very differently by him showing is his \"origin\" before he becomes a bald foe to the Man of Steel. He shows that his love of \"god vs man\" terrorises mankind when he ultimately creates Doomsday, and Batman realises Superman's inner heroism.It packs so many great \"out of nowhere\" excitement, including a first-look of the fearful Wonder Woman a.k.a. Diana Prince, played by Gal Gadot, and a fresh-new glimpse of the superhero DC canon: The Justice League.WATCH THIS MOVIE! The critics are out of their mind. It's a fun-packed action adventure which still keeps the movie enjoyable until it's final minutes of the movie. It's a FANTASTIC MOVIE! BEN AFFLECK AS BATMAN... is Incredible!A 10/10 overall!"
"I want to go on record as saying that this is a truly thrilling cinematic experience in so many ways. If pressed, I guess I could acknowledge that there were a couple ... let's say \"clumsy\" moments. And in a film that runs to three hours, that hardly seems like a significant issue, certainly not enough to rate it with fewer than 9 stars.This film has everything. There is dramatic tension right from the start. There is a magnificent story arc that picks up quite seamlessly from 'Man of Steel' and propels the viewer not only into the life of Clark Kent/Superman but also of Bruce Wayne/Batman.The villain is no mere cartoon of a villain; he is truly thoroughly (and apparently irrevocably) diabolical. He is a psychopath, and you wish for his death over and over and over. You want Superman to reduce him to ash with the power of his eyes.I have read a number of viewers' reviews, and it seems that the people who disliked the film / gave it a low rating had rather unfair and unrealistic expectations of it. That is, their own prejudices about how the plot could/should unfold or what the character development could/should be, etc. ruined the film for them. And that is a shame.My thought is: I settle into my seat, wait for the lights to dim, and then I wait to be transported by the film. I accept it, lock, stock, and barrel.As another reviewer remarked, I love how the film begins from the point of view of Bruce Wayne as he is among people on the ground who have fallen victim to the attack of Zod and the other Kryptonians.Why would Bruce Wayne not like Superman? Why would the good people of Earth hurl insults at Superman and burn him in effigy (on the news)? Because the good people of Earth just got catapulted into a new reality in which there are not only extraterrestrial beings (surprise!) but they are also superman! And a group of them are hell-bent on destroying humankind and taking the planet for themselves.It is difficult to see Superman as separate from the whole Kryptonian Krew.It seems that many moviegoers forgot that Bruce Wayne is also human. Sure, he's a hero, but he is flawed.. Just like the rest of us. He is a vigilante, after all.He has let his vigilantism get the better of him. HE is actually the one working outside the boundaries of the law, not Superman. It is the clear head of Alfred that shows us that he has gone into a rather dark place, that he has not seen what is really going on (in Luthor's scheme), and so he chooses to embark on his own scheme scheme to take out the alien invader. He is (allegedly) thinking of the future: if he wipes out the all-powerful alien, then it can't turn on humankind in the future. At least, he convinces himself of that.A philosophical question is raised in the film: should Clark Kent have remained a simple man from Kansas and never have become the Superman? Should he just let people die and let calamities happen? The question is answered for us in the character of Diana Prince/Wonder Woman. She withdrew from mankind (her exact words) and just sat around watching. Watching while people died horrible deaths all around her. So, should Superman have done the same? Do these special beings, these 'metahumans', have some kind of moral imperative to intervene, or should they be allowed to be regular people, too? It seems that humans want it both ways.It seems that humans are saying: \"Don't be a superalien ... except when I and my friends and family are in trouble. Then come save us.\""

"Batman v Superman: Ultimate Edition: If your looking for a quick, cheap thrill then you might not enjoy this film at the time. This movies theatrical version was butchered by WB and in doing so reshaped the story leaving numerous plot holes. So the Ultimate Edition is the full story and the one worth seeing. Watch 'Man of Steel' before seeing this movie. There is much to claw through here, so much so that the audience might easily find themselves exhausted from the overall aggression of the film. However, a lot of the story does work. The action is good, and the emotion feels real most of the time.This film is about Superman trying to become Superman. Trying to help the world, save people, find a place in this world not as an outcast, and yet is looked at has a threat by many. Superman is not from this world, yet He is trying to be human, find a place in this world, be excepted by earths people, and come into his destiny.This film is also about Batman being Batman for 20 years and losing faith in humanity, and fearing Superman, what Superman can do with his powers. Great film, great plot, great visuals. ---Yidioo"
"I didn't see the film in the theaters and just bought the \"Extended Edition \" on Amazon. I never properly saw Man of Steel- i think I rented it and watched it when already exhausted and fell asleep. I saw the mediocre user reviews and horrible reviews from critics of this film.They really have it wrong. This is the very best either Batman or Superman. It has a different take, on things. Much darker then earlier films even darker then the Christopher Nolan Batman films.First of all Christopher Nolan is an Executive Producer. So how bad could it be? I loved Sucker Punch and Zack Snyder was involved with that. So how bad could this be? Hans Zimmer did the music, so how bad could it be?I remember watching the old Superman TV shows and reading the Superman and Batman comics as a little kid and loved them, but i wouldn't call myself a \"fan boy\" of comic universes, like so many younger people today. As an older adult I will admit my favorite TV show of all time was Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but watched it on DVD only after it had finished. I saw the second of the Dark Knight series in the theater, but the other two, I watched on DVD. They were great, but not my favorite films like so many people. i also loved the first couple Superman and Batman films in the older series. Regardless, i was not waiting with baited breath to see Man of Steel or this one.I'm more of a serious film fan, who can watch Stanley Kubrick films over and over and my favorite films in the last twenty years, are Eyes Wide Shut and Intersteller, both of which i've watched multiple times.So, with that said, take it from me, the critics have this film very wrong, just as critics hated 2001: A Space Odyssey when it first came out. This film will have lasting appreciation.Surprised how much I liked Ben Afleck's Batman. it was hard to get into Henry Cavil's scrawnier looking Superman, but it grew on me. Amy Adams was great as Lois Lane, The Gal Gadol Wonder Women was amazing. Lex Luther was terrific, like Nolan's Joker. Jeremy Irons was the best Alfred ever. Holly Hunter and Diane Lane was good too. The movie had bad reviews but made a billion dollars. Hopefully everyone buys the Ultimate Edition and it breaks sales records and the film is re-appreciated. I have no idea what scenes this Ultimate Edition added, but it is pretty perfect. Now I can't wait for Wonder Woman and the Justice League and as soon as I finish writing this am going to watch Man of Steal. I'm into it now!I can only surmise that the bad reviews stem from too much expectations of the rigid fan boy types and the radical changes in tone, we see in this film.Total masterpiece of cinema, but I have a few criticisms. There are a few hollow scenes of typical Idiot cops and authorities getting everything wrong in a cliché type way and it has a few filler scenes of that type and a few moments here and there that felt rushed and cheesy. Maybe not everything restored into the Ultimate Edition should have been. I wish there had been more Kevin Costner scenes."

"The whole entire Batman V Superman movie was great and yes even though it felt slow to the majority of the people who watched it but to me I enjoyed every part and every scene of Batman V Superman and when it got to the fight scenes both batman VS Superman and the Doomsday fight it brought so much drama, intensity, and epic performances. So with that being said I give this movie a good 10/10 because it really did go to my expectations and it brought a powerful performance and a powerful yet epic introduction to the upcoming Justice League."

"Zack Snyder not only understands the characters but he also understands how to craft a real amazing movie for fans - honestly blew me away (extended cut) Brilliant!Don't believe what the internet is telling you to think - take this from a person who has worked in the comic book industry - this is amazing!"

"When I first wrote a review for this movie a year ago exclaiming my excitement for the film, I had been high off a fresh dose of live-action DC superheroes playing out the beloved comic book stories that I had grown up on. It was all playing out before my eyes and coming to life. After a few months had passed, I began to notice things about the movie that I disliked: little gaps in the story, things that didn't add up, etc. My original rating of a 10 / 10 dropped to an 8 /10. But today it has gone back up to a 10. The extended version of the film not only rectifies the gaps but also silences critics.Many claimed that the movie was too dark or that it just didn't make sense. To those people, I say: \"Pick up a comic book!\" Many of the critics of this particular film were part of the superhero bandwagon that formed when Marvel began its spree of Avengers-related films. In fact, its estimated that over 60% of people who go to see 'superhero' genre films have never picked up a comic book in their life. I would argue that similar numbers could figure to those which view the CW televised DC Universe shows. People complain that DC comics is just too dark but the fact is that these movies are based upon actual comics which are meant to be dark (ex: The Dark Knight Returns, Injustice, etc.). Its like complaining that Game of Thrones (the TV series) sucks because they kill off too many characters. Read the books! Its frustrating to see such a beautiful work of art like Batman V Superman criticized by those ignorant to its universe and its meaning. This movie is in fact a catalyst that opens numerous doorways and leaves true fans in awe of the possibilities for future movies. But regardless of whether or not people choose to educate themselves, this film's DVD/Blu-ray extended version puts the theater release to shame. All of the plot holes and gaps are filled in 30 minutes of extended footage scattered throughout the film. The movie ultimately becomes more complete and people will wish that the movie had shown the full 3 hours of footage in its theatrical debut. As a major DC comics fan, I will of course pick up on things that a comics fan would not, but someone who does not read comics would learn to appreciate this film in its entirety with the extended version. Get your hands on a copy today or find it on Netflix or the internet somewhere!"

"I ignored the bad reviews and watched anyways. This film had a lot to live up to after Civil War was released and I went into this film expecting the worst. It ended up to be the best Superhero film of 2016 to me. One complaint was that this film was more concerned about universe building than telling a great story than Civil War but for me it was the other way around; Civil War felt like a build up to something else and to be honest, I felt that way when I saw the other MCU films. Batman vs Superman however not only had a great story, but it also felt a lot more consistent than Civil War. This film was way more diverse with the cast than the MCU but unlike the MCU, I felt like this film doesn't go overboard with the SJW stuff like the MCU films or The Star Wars Sequel films do. The Visuals were AMAZING, The Score by Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL was AMAZING as well, The Tone is just right as I actually felt for the characters emotionally, The Cinematography kept my eyes glued to the screen, and the script felt really Intelligent and Complex and despite people calling the writing confusing, I was able to piece it together with no problem whatsoever. This film is similar to Empire Strikes back in terms of popularity so over time after the other movies are released, this movie would probably be more popular.This film was way better than I Expected and deserves another chance.

"Its shame to see what critics and marvel fans did to this movie and targeted Zack Snyder for it. I have seen this movie more than 25 times till date. And i enjoy this movie as much as i enjoyed the first time. The fans who have read DC comics, wouldn't be disappointed in this movie. Its dark movie, yes it is. Because the title shows the intense situation at hand. Two superheroes about to rip each other apart for whatever reasons that brought them to this stage. Yes it had to be dark and intense.Only marvel can be stupid enough to show an alien invasion where humans are loosing the battle and the super heroes are cracking jokes while battles as if they are playing ping pong. a person playing Call of Duty game is more serious while playing than the marvel heroes fighting aliens."

"Last week some news came out from somebody online who had claimed to have seen a finished version of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. If you were like me, you've been leery of checking it out because you weren't sure how much might actually be true. Now Zack Snyder has spoken out about the spoiler-filled post, although his response doesn't really clear anything up.In a word, to MTV, he called the post \"hilarious,which might imply that he's saying that it's mostly, if not entirely, untrue. That might be the case, but then again he could have just said it was untrue and he didn't say that. What he did say, however, is that he doesn't like spoilers. While this may seem odd for the director who's most recent trailer appeared to give away the entire movie, Snyder says that's not the case. Even if you've seen the trailer, you can rest easy, as there is much more we have not seen in then finished film. Says Snyder I have the benefit of seeing the movie. It's cool that think it's too much, and I appreciate people not wanting to know, but there's plenty that they don't know. There's a lot of movie that's not in the trailer. In the process of calling the Batman v Superman Reddit review hilarious, Snyder goes on to talk about how he hates it when spoilers come out. The director would much rather that fans see the movie mostly blind. While he understands that some fans may wish to find the answers before hand, he wants his movies to be mysteries going in. If you're, as an audience member, exploring these articles, looking for answers to questions that you have, maybe you're okay with knowing before you go. It's like an individual taste. But like I said, I want people to see the movie without knowing.Spoilers are a topic that mean different things to different people. While most try to avoid them to some degree, the need to solve the mystery is a nearly universal human experience. We have an inclination to want to know the truth, even while also wanting to be surprised. For most of us getting some information is good, but getting all the information is bad, of course, only getting the details that you want can be difficult."
"The theatrical is choppy, poorly edited, hard to follow, with some really good moments mixed in their. The extended is much more fluent and is much easier to follow, it does have a long runtime, which might make it seem a bit dragging on, but if you like long films done right, like Lord of the Rings, you will like this movie as long as you get into the characters and story. Speaking of which, the story starts out perfectly showing Bruce Wayne as a character, and it is very powerful. There are several moments in this movie that are powerful, emotional, and shocking. Characters. Batman is my favorite fictional character of all time, and believe me when I say, Ben Affleck as Batman was perfect, he had the charisma, the anger, and the look of being through some bad stuff Gal Gadot also does perfect as Wonder Woman, but if you want to really see how good she does, go watch the Wonder Woman movie. Henry Call as Superman. I really don't like it when people say Christopher Reeves is better. Don't get me wrong, Reeves does great, but can you imagine him as Superman in this movie? I wouldn't like it. It would be like Adam West playing Batman in The Dark Knight. Henry Cavill does great in this role, I can say everything about him as I said with Ben Affleck. Jesse Eisenberg as Luthor. I thought it was different in a good way. I've heard a criticism for him as being too much like Joker, but is that a bad thing? Joker is my favorite villain, so to see Superman have an enemy that crazy, but still hold the values Luthor needs to be Luthor, I think it is great. The thing I thought this movie was lacking in the first and second acts was humor, at least good humor. If there was more humor, I would've given this movie a ten because it would give a more relaxing feel to the parts that needed it. All in all though, this movie was awesome, it had powerful moments, it was badass, and just plain fun. It had a great story arc and does its job very well."

"*I will be talking about the Ultimate Edition of the film* This was one of the most anticipated CBM of all time. Ever since the arrival and subsequent success of Marvel's The Avengers people have wondered when will DC launch its own cinematic universe, one of the main reasons being the opportunity to finally see titans such as Batman and Superman share the screen together: the ultimate nerd dream. On 2016, the moment finally came for BvS to be released AND.. it performed poorly. Not only did critical reception left a lot to be desired, but fan reactions where surprisingly split after its cinematic debut. People either loved it and called Zack a genius, or hated it and called him a hack. Me, personally, I found myself with middle of the road feelings, for sure, but more leaning towards the negative side with subsequent viewings. The theatrical cut of the film showcased amazing performances, incredible visuals, and action set pieces that seemed like comic book panels come to life, in a good way. However, when it comes to its narrative structure and more technical aspects like editing, the film was seriously flawed. More plot holes than Age of Ultron, questionable character decisions, random editing that lacked cohesion and focus, and forced dramatic moments that lacked any impact because the attempts at character development ranged from limited to nonexistent, especially when it comes to Superman's character. I thought it was a 5/10 movie at best. As such, I was kind of skeptical about the idea of a 30 minute longer version. I say kind of because I know how Zack works. I remember Watchmen being vastly improved with its director's cut, so in a way I was expecting BvS to perform in a similar manner, but I also feared those 30 minutes wold be just there to amplify action and discredit storytelling issues. Oh boy, I'm so glad I was proved wrong. The ultimate cut of the film was infuriating, but not because it was awful, but because it questions the sanity of WB executives and editors and makes you wonder what were they thinking during the editing process. What I got out of the Ultimate Edition was a thought-provoking deconstruction of two very iconic superheroes that gave spotlight to the struggles both of them face when they aren't fighting crime. What I got was an extremely well produced character study on both Batman and Superman in a cynical world, a world dangerously close to our own. We meet Batman as a ruthless, worn out hero that has seen the failure behind his ideals and witnessed some truly horrifying things in his life. Superman, on the other hand, is portrayed as a godlike figure that seeks to do good in the world, but finds himself emotionally conflicted once he realized that every good deed he does leaves behind a trail of destruction (most of it due to Luthor's antics). In my opinion, this is a hugely original approach, one that distances itself from the rest of the competition and delivers a dark, somber, yet relevant superhero movie that understands both characters and gives them real human struggles to deal with. I felt invested in both of them, and hoped that by the end of the film both could find a way to redeem themselves. Their character arcs were very well established during the first two acts of the movie, and by the time we get to the titular climactic battle the emotion behind the jaw-dropping action is intensified. Lex Luthor as a villain was also given more time to develop with this new edition. One of the main criticisms with the original version was the fact that his plan relied too much on conveniences, and the character's mannerisms and mad-scientist attitude was annoying, and that goes without saying his motivations were unclear. Not only do we spend more time understanding his hate for any godlike figure and thus his hatred for Superman, but the added scenes allowed us to witness his entire plan come to fruition. It sells the cold, manipulative, calculating attributes of his comic counterpart. The acting is spot on. Every actor owns his/her role, from Cavill's Superman, to Ben Affleck as Batman, Eisenberg as Luthor, and Gadot as Wonder Woman, whose scenes are brief, but are more than enough to sell the strong and ferocious warrior that she is. Cinematography is stunning, and miles above that of Man of Steel's. And the soundtrack by Zimmer and Junkie XL? Perfect, just perfect. When it comes to flaws, the film still has some of those. The Martha moment, while serving as a pivotal character moment for Batman, felt off in execution, and its understandable that many people got mad at it. If your main complaint about BvS the first time around was its bleak tone and subject matter, this film is still not for you. I understand most were expecting to see the heroes being the most iconic versions of themselves, clashing in an elongated battle and evoking the same feelings The Avengers gave audiences back in 2012. In that sense, the film will remain divisive, but at least I have the comfort of saying that, at the very least, the film is competently made."

"This film was amazing. Ben Affleck was easily the best part of this movie, he brought his a-game as Batman. The chemistry between Affleck & Irons was outstanding. Gal Gadot did a great job as Wonder Woman. The fight between Batman & Superman was awesome. The final fight with Doomsday was outstanding in every way possible. However, there is only one problem with this film and that's Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor. He was sadly missed cast in this role, but then again it's really the fault of Warner Bros. Studios. Overall, this film deliver on almost every level. I highly recommend that you watch the extended version of this film."

"I know I know. I saw it in theaters too, and felt like it could've been so much better. While the Batman element was good, the narrative felt fractured, and the third act was just one long stunt scene. Superman was relegated to a supporting character, and other characters didn't get a chance to shine. And then I chanced on the ultimate cut. Calling it 30 mins of \"extra\" footage is unfair to Zack Snyder because it's exactly these 30 mins that makes the movie a worthy one. What I can say about the theatrical cut is this - It had the blockbuster elements - music, visuals, stunts, CGI. But, it lacked the human elements. The first 20 mins of the movie had it, but not after that. The extended cut in comparison has a flow to the narrative. There are no disjointed scenes, everything flows smoothly, and there's connective tissue. Superman gets to spend some time with his father, and mother. Clark Kent does some investigative journalism. Superman helps the people after the blast. Lois Lane doesn't jump to conclusions, she gets to the bottom of the crime. Lex Luthor apparently had a coherent plan - everything is explained pretty well. Wonder Woman was already good, so there's no change there :) Also, the \"Martha\" scene seems better executed, because it is a few seconds longer, and there's time to breathe it in. So, here's my take on this movie - The theatrical cut was junk. Get the Bluray for ultimate edition, and you shall not be disappointed. I've seen it so many more times now, and it's the definitive cut. It is the movie we deserve. It's a unique take on Batman, and Superman. It's a gritty take on the superhero movie genre, and definitely the best DCEU movie, and the best DC movie since The Dark Knight.P.S. Yes it's dark. We're adults, and we should appreciate mature film making without intentionally silly moments. It attempts to be philosophical, and something deep instead of just trying to make you chuckle."

"This is one of the best superhero movies ever made. Zack Snyder is a magician behind the camera.The reason behind so many complaints is the fact that Warner Bros. marketed this movie as a fight between Batman and Superman. That's not what it is. It's a movie about the origins of the Justice League.The cinematography, the acting and the score are all second to none. This film is phenomenal.P.S: watch the 3 hour extended cut that Snyder intended you to see, not the 2 and a half hour movie that Warner Bros. decided would be better for theaters."

"I don't care what the critics say, this is a very well-done movie. I'll start my review by listing what I like about the movie.1.) Ben Affleck is the best batman to me and it is not close. He pulls off the role of an aging batman extremely well. Also, Zack Snyder's vision of batman is legit. I have always hated batman up until this adaptation of him. Instead of being a conflicted and idealistic batman, this batman is dark, gritty, and 100% a badass. His equipment is decked out with machine guns and he has no aversion to killing people. In fact, he probably kills about 50 criminal by the time this movie is over. The warehouse scene is the coolest batman scene in any movie.2.) The development of a grudge between batman and superman is pulled off flawlessly. It actually makes sense why batman dislikes superman. Then, when they do fight it is about the coolest thing you can expect to see from a superhero film. 3.) I disagree with a lot of people about Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor. In my opinion, he played his role to perfection. 4.) B v S sets up Wonder Woman and Justice League with Gal Gadot's cameo as Wonder Woman and short clips of Aquaman, the Flash, and Cyborg. B v S is one of my favorite superhero films and rewatching it never gets old."

"The theatrical cut of this film is garbage which is why I rated it eight stars instead of nine. The first time I watched this film I didn't like it (not straight out hate but didn't like). Character motivations didn't make any sense, Lex was annoying as s***, editing was sloppy, and it was overly dark and broody for an action superhero movie. A year + a half, five Marvel films, a ton of bad reviews and a Justice League later a thought popped into my head: \"what if I watched BVS again\". This time I didn't have trailers ruining the best moments, I only vaguely remembered the film, and I was conditioned to look at it negatively but something unexpected happened: I actually loved it. Superman was just a normal person that tried to make a difference cause he could that others imposed their own beliefs on. Lex Luthor was a genius that couldn't stand his powerlessness compared to Superman or more accurately a super being. As Alfred said \"The fever, the rage, the feeling of powerlessness that turns good men... cruel\" and you see the same thought process in Batman. Batman, just like Lex Luthor feels powerless in the midst of a god-being and just like Lex he attempts to destroy him so he can get his sense of power back but unlike Lex, Batman learns something. I what is one of the corniest lines of the movie Superman says, \"Martha\" when he knows he can't win against Batman in a late desperate attempt to save his mother. Not only does this name connect with Bruce Wayne but it also shows what really matters to a man of steel: it isn't power, it isn't fame or anything else, it is his Mother and on a broader scale it is people. Lex (who doesn't care about people at all) knows he doesn't have the power so he creates something from his blood and the remains of Zod: A Doomsday for Superman. Not only does this film have depth but it also doesn't always explain it to you which is rare in a blockbuster action superhero flick normally cater to semi-comic book fans and people that want to shove popcorn in their mouths. This film rewards you for really noticing the details while still having massive explosions. One of my favorites is how Lex has all of Batman's branded killed which is why he isn't afraid of the branding at the end or Grandma's Peach Tea as a way of scaring the s*** out of someone. Of course, this film isn't perfect and I do have personal dislikes. The Batman V Superman fight was slow and pretty boring especially after watching such an amazing fight in Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 2 (If you haven't watched the animated Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 1 and 2 you are sorely missing out on something fantastic). Also, the addition of Wonder Woman who pretty much steals a hacker thing, gives it back and then suits up and fights against a giant monster thing. Not to say I don't like Wonder Woman (She is one of my favorite Superheroes of all time who showed not only can woman kick a** but they also don't need to be ashamed of their sexuality or gender) but she wasn't really that helpful to the plot and just brought in to expand the universe which was well done through Lex's superhuman hunting files. Also, the post-apocalyptic scene that was just a dream could have been cut but nothing is perfect except movies like Citizen Kane which isn't a lot of fun to watch cause it is too perfect. So to summarize, the theatrical cut is bad, the ultimate cut is Amazing and the other cut is meh. Please give it a second chance because it deserves it and save a good director from losing grace because of something he didn't do."
"I really liked it, don't know what all the hate is about. I'm actually a Marvel fan from when I was 7 or so, but Superman and Batman together in 1 movie? Just great. And personally I like Ben Affleck even better than Christian Bale as Batman. So just watch and enjoy, I know I did!"

"That's right. We have been waiting for these two heroes to finally meet and fight against each other. This movie is so good in both plot and special effects.Henry Cavill and Ben Affleck have performed well in their acting stages. They are the best superhero actors and they have filmed their fighting scenes very well. The movie starts to show the conflict between the lives of the heroes and now they have blamed each other for it. This movie is amazing and sets up a good plot for Dawn Justice."

"Actually...I didn't know what to expect. When you see Wonder Woman, you know it will be off of Wonder Woman and off of a Wonder Woman story, but with Batman V Superman, I was like, \"hmmmm, so who is this about?\" It was pretty obvious that it would feature many characters, but I thought the introduction to Batman was amazing. Ben Affleck nailed the part, not only as Batman but also as Bruce Wayne. He is my Batman. Henry Cavill continued to be super as the Man of Steel. And he is my Super - Man. A dark story? Yes, without a doubt. Could it have had a few more jokes? Sure. But not all movies or stories need to have jokes when certain events are serious. I really hope people can see this review and take another look at the movie, because, I loved it. I really hope the ratings can go up, eventually. And P.S, this movie is the perfect set up to Justice League."

"I'll start by making it clear I have only ever seen the Ultimate Edition. I'm aware of what was cut out for the theatrical release, so I will concede up front that most of the criticisms about pacing, editing, and missing bits of plot at release were merited.With that caveat out of the way, I must reiterate that this was bar-none the boldest superhero movie I have ever seen. To me, it was arguably the best as well, though \"best\" shouldn't be taken to mean \"most enjoyable.\" That honor easily goes to \"Thor: Ragnarok.\" What makes BvS stand out among other films in the genre is that it takes two characters who have been done to death since the 1970s and brings them up to date. I recently tried to watch \"Superman: The Movie\" for the first time in a number of years, and while it was still good and Reeves will always be iconic, I just couldn't take it seriously. I'll put it this way: If the story in BvS was \"stupid\" in your view but Superman turning back time by spinning the earth backward on its axis didn't seem like one of the dumbest things you have ever seen -in any movie from any genre- to the extent that it outright ruins the movie for you, then your opinion about BvS isn't worth much. Nostalgic bias was always going to be a problem for this movie, and the way people reacted to and reviewed \"Man of Steel\" was telling in this regard.That brings me to Zack Snyder's take on Superman. You know, that guy whose status as the first extraterrestrial ever encountered by humanity was a total non-issue in the old movies. Apparently, Snyder has a similar view to my own in that his take on the Man of Steel makes his being an alien a core piece of his identity. He may look like any other (absurdly attractive) person, but he knows what he is, and that makes him perpetually uncertain of where he fits in this world. He is essentially good and really does care about people, but he struggles to truly empathize with the likes of us. To be human is to be frail, and that is not something he can easily relate to. This is the root of his conflict with Batman.Just as Clark struggles to genuinely relate to most people, Snyder's Batman either refuses to or otherwise just can't relate to Superman. He doesn't see him as anything but a threat regardless of Superman's clear good intentions. Remember, a small group of Kryptonians were able to bring humanity to the brink of extinction in less than a day, and Bruce Wayne is nothing if not a realist. He didn't know the guy from Kansas. He only knew the god from another world.While Batman's anger toward and fear of Superman are readily apparent from the start, Superman's inability to imagine things from Bruce Wayne's perspective only becomes truly apparent during their first real interaction. This reminded me of the animated version of the \"world's finest\" storyline, where Superman judges Batman harshly for using fear tactics and threats of violence (also, actual violence) to get the job done. Superman wasn't willing to consider what it would take for a human man to fight criminals and save innocents, or what that life would do to him over time. Just as Batman didn't see the guy from Kansas, Superman didn't see the man who lives his life trapped in one brutal, unthinkably traumatic moment (this was beautifully conveyed during the film's opening moments), and had spent his whole adult life bearing witness to humanity at its absolute worst.The conflict between these two characters is as old as human history. They want the same things, but they can't understand one another. So they fight. And what a fight it was.Watching a fight between, say, Captain America and Iron Man was, to me, more frustrating than anything because each understood the other's perspective perfectly. The fight between Batman and Superman in BvS was genuinely gut-wrenching, as intended, because they would have understood one another if either had tried. The whole sequence hilighted Batman's tactical prowess and ability to control a situation. Maybe the most badass thing about the fight was that it ended exactly where Batman planned. That brings me to the big elephant in the room named \"Martha.\"I can't recall exactly which YouTuber put it this way, but if you thought the \"save Martha\" exchange was about their mothers having the same name, you had your brain turned off. The brain-on people have explained this to death, but it bears repeating. This was the moment when Superman became humanized to Batman. He was about to die, and his only concern was for his adoptive human mother. He still believed that the man about to take his life would do the right thing. Even with the cowl on, there was no mistaking the look on Batman's face. It was the look of shame, guilt, and sudden uncertainty that says \"What am I doing?\" Turns out even the most brutal, angry version of Bruce Wayne is better than Tony Stark at knowing right from wrong. At knowing that he had gone too far.From there, the third act was a series of truly impressive (albeit mostly CGI) fight sequences, beginning with what I regard as the undisputed champion of Batman fights. Nothing in the Nolan movies (and especially nothing in the Burton movies) even came close. Go ahead, try to convince yourself that Batman and Bane taking turns punching one another in the face until Bane's mask broke was a good fight sequence. No, this was a fight straight out of \"Arkham Knight,\" and it was glorious. The battle against Doomsday really was one for the books. From the moment Wonder Woman arrived accompanied by the intense sounds of Tina Guo's electric cello to Superman's tragic, heroic death at the hands of Doomsday, I was glued to the screen. Sure, the mere presence of Doomsday spoiled the end to a degree, but watching the Man of Steel laboring to carry that kryptonite spear towards certain death was no less impactful. A brief word on Jesse Eisenberg's take on Lex Luthor. At least one other reviewer on this site already said it best when they pointed out that this was his origin story. If you consider his scheme objectively, he is actually one of the more formidable incarnations of the character. If we're lucky, we'll eventually get to see a Snyder Cut of \"Justice League\" and find out where this story was actually meant to go. For the record, Joss Whedon and Danny Elfman both should have said \"no\" to taking a dump on someone else's art."
"BATMAN V SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE brings a fantastic surprise to a smash-hit team-up with one of the worlds most beloved DC Comics' icons of all time. The movie delivers spectacular casting, and fantastic acting with different characters having their shine in each scenes.The story follows Clark Kent/Superman who becomes a threat, after the destruction in Metropolis in Man Of Steel.(2013). Batman/Bruce Wayne sees him as a threat and begins his war on Superman.The movie brings spectacular storytelling, it tells the complications of human against alien who are on the same side, and the first meeting of Batman and Superman. The story of Bruce Wayne, with his many years of The Caped Crusader, sends him on a spiral of \"out of control\", sheer anger, and builds tension to wanting to defeat the Man of Steel. Snyder has fantastically gave this storytelling an exciting nod to the comics.Lex Luthor, played by Jesse Einsberg, delivers a very interesting performance, but very differently by him showing is his \"origin\" before he becomes a bald foe to the Man of Steel. He shows that his love of \"god vs man\" terrorises mankind when he ultimately creates Doomsday, and Batman realises Superman's inner heroism.It packs so many great \"out of nowhere\" excitement, including a first-look of the fearful Wonder Woman a.k.a. Diana Prince, played by Gal Gadot, and a fresh-new glimpse of the superhero DC canon: The Justice League.WATCH THIS MOVIE! The critics are out of their mind. It's a fun-packed action adventure which still keeps the movie enjoyable until it's final minutes of the movie. It's a FANTASTIC MOVIE! BEN AFFLECK AS BATMAN... is Incredible!A 10/10 overall!"
"I want to go on record as saying that this is a truly thrilling cinematic experience in so many ways. If pressed, I guess I could acknowledge that there were a couple ... let's say \"clumsy\" moments. And in a film that runs to three hours, that hardly seems like a significant issue, certainly not enough to rate it with fewer than 9 stars.This film has everything. There is dramatic tension right from the start. There is a magnificent story arc that picks up quite seamlessly from 'Man of Steel' and propels the viewer not only into the life of Clark Kent/Superman but also of Bruce Wayne/Batman.The villain is no mere cartoon of a villain; he is truly thoroughly (and apparently irrevocably) diabolical. He is a psychopath, and you wish for his death over and over and over. You want Superman to reduce him to ash with the power of his eyes.I have read a number of viewers' reviews, and it seems that the people who disliked the film / gave it a low rating had rather unfair and unrealistic expectations of it. That is, their own prejudices about how the plot could/should unfold or what the character development could/should be, etc. ruined the film for them. And that is a shame.My thought is: I settle into my seat, wait for the lights to dim, and then I wait to be transported by the film. I accept it, lock, stock, and barrel.As another reviewer remarked, I love how the film begins from the point of view of Bruce Wayne as he is among people on the ground who have fallen victim to the attack of Zod and the other Kryptonians.Why would Bruce Wayne not like Superman? Why would the good people of Earth hurl insults at Superman and burn him in effigy (on the news)? Because the good people of Earth just got catapulted into a new reality in which there are not only extraterrestrial beings (surprise!) but they are also superman! And a group of them are hell-bent on destroying humankind and taking the planet for themselves.It is difficult to see Superman as separate from the whole Kryptonian Krew.It seems that many moviegoers forgot that Bruce Wayne is also human. Sure, he's a hero, but he is flawed.. Just like the rest of us. He is a vigilante, after all.He has let his vigilantism get the better of him. HE is actually the one working outside the boundaries of the law, not Superman. It is the clear head of Alfred that shows us that he has gone into a rather dark place, that he has not seen what is really going on (in Luthor's scheme), and so he chooses to embark on his own scheme scheme to take out the alien invader. He is (allegedly) thinking of the future: if he wipes out the all-powerful alien, then it can't turn on humankind in the future. At least, he convinces himself of that.A philosophical question is raised in the film: should Clark Kent have remained a simple man from Kansas and never have become the Superman? Should he just let people die and let calamities happen? The question is answered for us in the character of Diana Prince/Wonder Woman. She withdrew from mankind (her exact words) and just sat around watching. Watching while people died horrible deaths all around her. So, should Superman have done the same? Do these special beings, these 'metahumans', have some kind of moral imperative to intervene, or should they be allowed to be regular people, too? It seems that humans want it both ways.It seems that humans are saying: \"Don't be a superalien ... except when I and my friends and family are in trouble. Then come save us.\""

"Batman v Superman: Ultimate Edition: If your looking for a quick, cheap thrill then you might not enjoy this film at the time. This movies theatrical version was butchered by WB and in doing so reshaped the story leaving numerous plot holes. So the Ultimate Edition is the full story and the one worth seeing. Watch 'Man of Steel' before seeing this movie. There is much to claw through here, so much so that the audience might easily find themselves exhausted from the overall aggression of the film. However, a lot of the story does work. The action is good, and the emotion feels real most of the time.This film is about Superman trying to become Superman. Trying to help the world, save people, find a place in this world not as an outcast, and yet is looked at has a threat by many. Superman is not from this world, yet He is trying to be human, find a place in this world, be excepted by earths people, and come into his destiny.This film is also about Batman being Batman for 20 years and losing faith in humanity, and fearing Superman, what Superman can do with his powers. Great film, great plot, great visuals. ---Yidioo"
"I didn't see the film in the theaters and just bought the \"Extended Edition \" on Amazon. I never properly saw Man of Steel- i think I rented it and watched it when already exhausted and fell asleep. I saw the mediocre user reviews and horrible reviews from critics of this film.They really have it wrong. This is the very best either Batman or Superman. It has a different take, on things. Much darker then earlier films even darker then the Christopher Nolan Batman films.First of all Christopher Nolan is an Executive Producer. So how bad could it be? I loved Sucker Punch and Zack Snyder was involved with that. So how bad could this be? Hans Zimmer did the music, so how bad could it be?I remember watching the old Superman TV shows and reading the Superman and Batman comics as a little kid and loved them, but i wouldn't call myself a \"fan boy\" of comic universes, like so many younger people today. As an older adult I will admit my favorite TV show of all time was Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but watched it on DVD only after it had finished. I saw the second of the Dark Knight series in the theater, but the other two, I watched on DVD. They were great, but not my favorite films like so many people. i also loved the first couple Superman and Batman films in the older series. Regardless, i was not waiting with baited breath to see Man of Steel or this one.I'm more of a serious film fan, who can watch Stanley Kubrick films over and over and my favorite films in the last twenty years, are Eyes Wide Shut and Intersteller, both of which i've watched multiple times.So, with that said, take it from me, the critics have this film very wrong, just as critics hated 2001: A Space Odyssey when it first came out. This film will have lasting appreciation.Surprised how much I liked Ben Afleck's Batman. it was hard to get into Henry Cavil's scrawnier looking Superman, but it grew on me. Amy Adams was great as Lois Lane, The Gal Gadol Wonder Women was amazing. Lex Luther was terrific, like Nolan's Joker. Jeremy Irons was the best Alfred ever. Holly Hunter and Diane Lane was good too. The movie had bad reviews but made a billion dollars. Hopefully everyone buys the Ultimate Edition and it breaks sales records and the film is re-appreciated. I have no idea what scenes this Ultimate Edition added, but it is pretty perfect. Now I can't wait for Wonder Woman and the Justice League and as soon as I finish writing this am going to watch Man of Steal. I'm into it now!I can only surmise that the bad reviews stem from too much expectations of the rigid fan boy types and the radical changes in tone, we see in this film.Total masterpiece of cinema, but I have a few criticisms. There are a few hollow scenes of typical Idiot cops and authorities getting everything wrong in a cliché type way and it has a few filler scenes of that type and a few moments here and there that felt rushed and cheesy. Maybe not everything restored into the Ultimate Edition should have been. I wish there had been more Kevin Costner scenes."

"The whole entire Batman V Superman movie was great and yes even though it felt slow to the majority of the people who watched it but to me I enjoyed every part and every scene of Batman V Superman and when it got to the fight scenes both batman VS Superman and the Doomsday fight it brought so much drama, intensity, and epic performances. So with that being said I give this movie a good 10/10 because it really did go to my expectations and it brought a powerful performance and a powerful yet epic introduction to the upcoming Justice League."

"Zack Snyder not only understands the characters but he also understands how to craft a real amazing movie for fans - honestly blew me away (extended cut) Brilliant!Don't believe what the internet is telling you to think - take this from a person who has worked in the comic book industry - this is amazing!"

"When I first wrote a review for this movie a year ago exclaiming my excitement for the film, I had been high off a fresh dose of live-action DC superheroes playing out the beloved comic book stories that I had grown up on. It was all playing out before my eyes and coming to life. After a few months had passed, I began to notice things about the movie that I disliked: little gaps in the story, things that didn't add up, etc. My original rating of a 10 / 10 dropped to an 8 /10. But today it has gone back up to a 10. The extended version of the film not only rectifies the gaps but also silences critics.Many claimed that the movie was too dark or that it just didn't make sense. To those people, I say: \"Pick up a comic book!\" Many of the critics of this particular film were part of the superhero bandwagon that formed when Marvel began its spree of Avengers-related films. In fact, its estimated that over 60% of people who go to see 'superhero' genre films have never picked up a comic book in their life. I would argue that similar numbers could figure to those which view the CW televised DC Universe shows. People complain that DC comics is just too dark but the fact is that these movies are based upon actual comics which are meant to be dark (ex: The Dark Knight Returns, Injustice, etc.). Its like complaining that Game of Thrones (the TV series) sucks because they kill off too many characters. Read the books! Its frustrating to see such a beautiful work of art like Batman V Superman criticized by those ignorant to its universe and its meaning. This movie is in fact a catalyst that opens numerous doorways and leaves true fans in awe of the possibilities for future movies. But regardless of whether or not people choose to educate themselves, this film's DVD/Blu-ray extended version puts the theater release to shame. All of the plot holes and gaps are filled in 30 minutes of extended footage scattered throughout the film. The movie ultimately becomes more complete and people will wish that the movie had shown the full 3 hours of footage in its theatrical debut. As a major DC comics fan, I will of course pick up on things that a comics fan would not, but someone who does not read comics would learn to appreciate this film in its entirety with the extended version. Get your hands on a copy today or find it on Netflix or the internet somewhere!"

"I ignored the bad reviews and watched anyways. This film had a lot to live up to after Civil War was released and I went into this film expecting the worst. It ended up to be the best Superhero film of 2016 to me. One complaint was that this film was more concerned about universe building than telling a great story than Civil War but for me it was the other way around; Civil War felt like a build up to something else and to be honest, I felt that way when I saw the other MCU films. Batman vs Superman however not only had a great story, but it also felt a lot more consistent than Civil War. This film was way more diverse with the cast than the MCU but unlike the MCU, I felt like this film doesn't go overboard with the SJW stuff like the MCU films or The Star Wars Sequel films do. The Visuals were AMAZING, The Score by Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL was AMAZING as well, The Tone is just right as I actually felt for the characters emotionally, The Cinematography kept my eyes glued to the screen, and the script felt really Intelligent and Complex and despite people calling the writing confusing, I was able to piece it together with no problem whatsoever. This film is similar to Empire Strikes back in terms of popularity so over time after the other movies are released, this movie would probably be more popular.This film was way better than I Expected and deserves another chance.

"Its shame to see what critics and marvel fans did to this movie and targeted Zack Snyder for it. I have seen this movie more than 25 times till date. And i enjoy this movie as much as i enjoyed the first time. The fans who have read DC comics, wouldn't be disappointed in this movie. Its dark movie, yes it is. Because the title shows the intense situation at hand. Two superheroes about to rip each other apart for whatever reasons that brought them to this stage. Yes it had to be dark and intense.Only marvel can be stupid enough to show an alien invasion where humans are loosing the battle and the super heroes are cracking jokes while battles as if they are playing ping pong. a person playing Call of Duty game is more serious while playing than the marvel heroes fighting aliens."

"Last week some news came out from somebody online who had claimed to have seen a finished version of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. If you were like me, you've been leery of checking it out because you weren't sure how much might actually be true. Now Zack Snyder has spoken out about the spoiler-filled post, although his response doesn't really clear anything up.In a word, to MTV, he called the post \"hilarious,which might imply that he's saying that it's mostly, if not entirely, untrue. That might be the case, but then again he could have just said it was untrue and he didn't say that. What he did say, however, is that he doesn't like spoilers. While this may seem odd for the director who's most recent trailer appeared to give away the entire movie, Snyder says that's not the case. Even if you've seen the trailer, you can rest easy, as there is much more we have not seen in then finished film. Says Snyder I have the benefit of seeing the movie. It's cool that think it's too much, and I appreciate people not wanting to know, but there's plenty that they don't know. There's a lot of movie that's not in the trailer. In the process of calling the Batman v Superman Reddit review hilarious, Snyder goes on to talk about how he hates it when spoilers come out. The director would much rather that fans see the movie mostly blind. While he understands that some fans may wish to find the answers before hand, he wants his movies to be mysteries going in. If you're, as an audience member, exploring these articles, looking for answers to questions that you have, maybe you're okay with knowing before you go. It's like an individual taste. But like I said, I want people to see the movie without knowing.Spoilers are a topic that mean different things to different people. While most try to avoid them to some degree, the need to solve the mystery is a nearly universal human experience. We have an inclination to want to know the truth, even while also wanting to be surprised. For most of us getting some information is good, but getting all the information is bad, of course, only getting the details that you want can be difficult."
"The theatrical is choppy, poorly edited, hard to follow, with some really good moments mixed in their. The extended is much more fluent and is much easier to follow, it does have a long runtime, which might make it seem a bit dragging on, but if you like long films done right, like Lord of the Rings, you will like this movie as long as you get into the characters and story. Speaking of which, the story starts out perfectly showing Bruce Wayne as a character, and it is very powerful. There are several moments in this movie that are powerful, emotional, and shocking. Characters. Batman is my favorite fictional character of all time, and believe me when I say, Ben Affleck as Batman was perfect, he had the charisma, the anger, and the look of being through some bad stuff Gal Gadot also does perfect as Wonder Woman, but if you want to really see how good she does, go watch the Wonder Woman movie. Henry Call as Superman. I really don't like it when people say Christopher Reeves is better. Don't get me wrong, Reeves does great, but can you imagine him as Superman in this movie? I wouldn't like it. It would be like Adam West playing Batman in The Dark Knight. Henry Cavill does great in this role, I can say everything about him as I said with Ben Affleck. Jesse Eisenberg as Luthor. I thought it was different in a good way. I've heard a criticism for him as being too much like Joker, but is that a bad thing? Joker is my favorite villain, so to see Superman have an enemy that crazy, but still hold the values Luthor needs to be Luthor, I think it is great. The thing I thought this movie was lacking in the first and second acts was humor, at least good humor. If there was more humor, I would've given this movie a ten because it would give a more relaxing feel to the parts that needed it. All in all though, this movie was awesome, it had powerful moments, it was badass, and just plain fun. It had a great story arc and does its job very well."

"*I will be talking about the Ultimate Edition of the film* This was one of the most anticipated CBM of all time. Ever since the arrival and subsequent success of Marvel's The Avengers people have wondered when will DC launch its own cinematic universe, one of the main reasons being the opportunity to finally see titans such as Batman and Superman share the screen together: the ultimate nerd dream. On 2016, the moment finally came for BvS to be released AND.. it performed poorly. Not only did critical reception left a lot to be desired, but fan reactions where surprisingly split after its cinematic debut. People either loved it and called Zack a genius, or hated it and called him a hack. Me, personally, I found myself with middle of the road feelings, for sure, but more leaning towards the negative side with subsequent viewings. The theatrical cut of the film showcased amazing performances, incredible visuals, and action set pieces that seemed like comic book panels come to life, in a good way. However, when it comes to its narrative structure and more technical aspects like editing, the film was seriously flawed. More plot holes than Age of Ultron, questionable character decisions, random editing that lacked cohesion and focus, and forced dramatic moments that lacked any impact because the attempts at character development ranged from limited to nonexistent, especially when it comes to Superman's character. I thought it was a 5/10 movie at best. As such, I was kind of skeptical about the idea of a 30 minute longer version. I say kind of because I know how Zack works. I remember Watchmen being vastly improved with its director's cut, so in a way I was expecting BvS to perform in a similar manner, but I also feared those 30 minutes wold be just there to amplify action and discredit storytelling issues. Oh boy, I'm so glad I was proved wrong. The ultimate cut of the film was infuriating, but not because it was awful, but because it questions the sanity of WB executives and editors and makes you wonder what were they thinking during the editing process. What I got out of the Ultimate Edition was a thought-provoking deconstruction of two very iconic superheroes that gave spotlight to the struggles both of them face when they aren't fighting crime. What I got was an extremely well produced character study on both Batman and Superman in a cynical world, a world dangerously close to our own. We meet Batman as a ruthless, worn out hero that has seen the failure behind his ideals and witnessed some truly horrifying things in his life. Superman, on the other hand, is portrayed as a godlike figure that seeks to do good in the world, but finds himself emotionally conflicted once he realized that every good deed he does leaves behind a trail of destruction (most of it due to Luthor's antics). In my opinion, this is a hugely original approach, one that distances itself from the rest of the competition and delivers a dark, somber, yet relevant superhero movie that understands both characters and gives them real human struggles to deal with. I felt invested in both of them, and hoped that by the end of the film both could find a way to redeem themselves. Their character arcs were very well established during the first two acts of the movie, and by the time we get to the titular climactic battle the emotion behind the jaw-dropping action is intensified. Lex Luthor as a villain was also given more time to develop with this new edition. One of the main criticisms with the original version was the fact that his plan relied too much on conveniences, and the character's mannerisms and mad-scientist attitude was annoying, and that goes without saying his motivations were unclear. Not only do we spend more time understanding his hate for any godlike figure and thus his hatred for Superman, but the added scenes allowed us to witness his entire plan come to fruition. It sells the cold, manipulative, calculating attributes of his comic counterpart. The acting is spot on. Every actor owns his/her role, from Cavill's Superman, to Ben Affleck as Batman, Eisenberg as Luthor, and Gadot as Wonder Woman, whose scenes are brief, but are more than enough to sell the strong and ferocious warrior that she is. Cinematography is stunning, and miles above that of Man of Steel's. And the soundtrack by Zimmer and Junkie XL? Perfect, just perfect. When it comes to flaws, the film still has some of those. The Martha moment, while serving as a pivotal character moment for Batman, felt off in execution, and its understandable that many people got mad at it. If your main complaint about BvS the first time around was its bleak tone and subject matter, this film is still not for you. I understand most were expecting to see the heroes being the most iconic versions of themselves, clashing in an elongated battle and evoking the same feelings The Avengers gave audiences back in 2012. In that sense, the film will remain divisive, but at least I have the comfort of saying that, at the very least, the film is competently made."

"This film was amazing. Ben Affleck was easily the best part of this movie, he brought his a-game as Batman. The chemistry between Affleck & Irons was outstanding. Gal Gadot did a great job as Wonder Woman. The fight between Batman & Superman was awesome. The final fight with Doomsday was outstanding in every way possible. However, there is only one problem with this film and that's Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor. He was sadly missed cast in this role, but then again it's really the fault of Warner Bros. Studios. Overall, this film deliver on almost every level. I highly recommend that you watch the extended version of this film."

"I know I know. I saw it in theaters too, and felt like it could've been so much better. While the Batman element was good, the narrative felt fractured, and the third act was just one long stunt scene. Superman was relegated to a supporting character, and other characters didn't get a chance to shine. And then I chanced on the ultimate cut. Calling it 30 mins of \"extra\" footage is unfair to Zack Snyder because it's exactly these 30 mins that makes the movie a worthy one. What I can say about the theatrical cut is this - It had the blockbuster elements - music, visuals, stunts, CGI. But, it lacked the human elements. The first 20 mins of the movie had it, but not after that. The extended cut in comparison has a flow to the narrative. There are no disjointed scenes, everything flows smoothly, and there's connective tissue. Superman gets to spend some time with his father, and mother. Clark Kent does some investigative journalism. Superman helps the people after the blast. Lois Lane doesn't jump to conclusions, she gets to the bottom of the crime. Lex Luthor apparently had a coherent plan - everything is explained pretty well. Wonder Woman was already good, so there's no change there :) Also, the \"Martha\" scene seems better executed, because it is a few seconds longer, and there's time to breathe it in. So, here's my take on this movie - The theatrical cut was junk. Get the Bluray for ultimate edition, and you shall not be disappointed. I've seen it so many more times now, and it's the definitive cut. It is the movie we deserve. It's a unique take on Batman, and Superman. It's a gritty take on the superhero movie genre, and definitely the best DCEU movie, and the best DC movie since The Dark Knight.P.S. Yes it's dark. We're adults, and we should appreciate mature film making without intentionally silly moments. It attempts to be philosophical, and something deep instead of just trying to make you chuckle."

"This is one of the best superhero movies ever made. Zack Snyder is a magician behind the camera.The reason behind so many complaints is the fact that Warner Bros. marketed this movie as a fight between Batman and Superman. That's not what it is. It's a movie about the origins of the Justice League.The cinematography, the acting and the score are all second to none. This film is phenomenal.P.S: watch the 3 hour extended cut that Snyder intended you to see, not the 2 and a half hour movie that Warner Bros. decided would be better for theaters."

"I don't care what the critics say, this is a very well-done movie. I'll start my review by listing what I like about the movie.1.) Ben Affleck is the best batman to me and it is not close. He pulls off the role of an aging batman extremely well. Also, Zack Snyder's vision of batman is legit. I have always hated batman up until this adaptation of him. Instead of being a conflicted and idealistic batman, this batman is dark, gritty, and 100% a badass. His equipment is decked out with machine guns and he has no aversion to killing people. In fact, he probably kills about 50 criminal by the time this movie is over. The warehouse scene is the coolest batman scene in any movie.2.) The development of a grudge between batman and superman is pulled off flawlessly. It actually makes sense why batman dislikes superman. Then, when they do fight it is about the coolest thing you can expect to see from a superhero film. 3.) I disagree with a lot of people about Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor. In my opinion, he played his role to perfection. 4.) B v S sets up Wonder Woman and Justice League with Gal Gadot's cameo as Wonder Woman and short clips of Aquaman, the Flash, and Cyborg. B v S is one of my favorite superhero films and rewatching it never gets old."

"The theatrical cut of this film is garbage which is why I rated it eight stars instead of nine. The first time I watched this film I didn't like it (not straight out hate but didn't like). Character motivations didn't make any sense, Lex was annoying as s***, editing was sloppy, and it was overly dark and broody for an action superhero movie. A year + a half, five Marvel films, a ton of bad reviews and a Justice League later a thought popped into my head: \"what if I watched BVS again\". This time I didn't have trailers ruining the best moments, I only vaguely remembered the film, and I was conditioned to look at it negatively but something unexpected happened: I actually loved it. Superman was just a normal person that tried to make a difference cause he could that others imposed their own beliefs on. Lex Luthor was a genius that couldn't stand his powerlessness compared to Superman or more accurately a super being. As Alfred said \"The fever, the rage, the feeling of powerlessness that turns good men... cruel\" and you see the same thought process in Batman. Batman, just like Lex Luthor feels powerless in the midst of a god-being and just like Lex he attempts to destroy him so he can get his sense of power back but unlike Lex, Batman learns something. I what is one of the corniest lines of the movie Superman says, \"Martha\" when he knows he can't win against Batman in a late desperate attempt to save his mother. Not only does this name connect with Bruce Wayne but it also shows what really matters to a man of steel: it isn't power, it isn't fame or anything else, it is his Mother and on a broader scale it is people. Lex (who doesn't care about people at all) knows he doesn't have the power so he creates something from his blood and the remains of Zod: A Doomsday for Superman. Not only does this film have depth but it also doesn't always explain it to you which is rare in a blockbuster action superhero flick normally cater to semi-comic book fans and people that want to shove popcorn in their mouths. This film rewards you for really noticing the details while still having massive explosions. One of my favorites is how Lex has all of Batman's branded killed which is why he isn't afraid of the branding at the end or Grandma's Peach Tea as a way of scaring the s*** out of someone. Of course, this film isn't perfect and I do have personal dislikes. The Batman V Superman fight was slow and pretty boring especially after watching such an amazing fight in Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 2 (If you haven't watched the animated Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 1 and 2 you are sorely missing out on something fantastic). Also, the addition of Wonder Woman who pretty much steals a hacker thing, gives it back and then suits up and fights against a giant monster thing. Not to say I don't like Wonder Woman (She is one of my favorite Superheroes of all time who showed not only can woman kick a** but they also don't need to be ashamed of their sexuality or gender) but she wasn't really that helpful to the plot and just brought in to expand the universe which was well done through Lex's superhuman hunting files. Also, the post-apocalyptic scene that was just a dream could have been cut but nothing is perfect except movies like Citizen Kane which isn't a lot of fun to watch cause it is too perfect. So to summarize, the theatrical cut is bad, the ultimate cut is Amazing and the other cut is meh. Please give it a second chance because it deserves it and save a good director from losing grace because of something he didn't do."
"I really liked it, don't know what all the hate is about. I'm actually a Marvel fan from when I was 7 or so, but Superman and Batman together in 1 movie? Just great. And personally I like Ben Affleck even better than Christian Bale as Batman. So just watch and enjoy, I know I did!"

"That's right. We have been waiting for these two heroes to finally meet and fight against each other. This movie is so good in both plot and special effects.Henry Cavill and Ben Affleck have performed well in their acting stages. They are the best superhero actors and they have filmed their fighting scenes very well. The movie starts to show the conflict between the lives of the heroes and now they have blamed each other for it. This movie is amazing and sets up a good plot for Dawn Justice."

"Actually...I didn't know what to expect. When you see Wonder Woman, you know it will be off of Wonder Woman and off of a Wonder Woman story, but with Batman V Superman, I was like, \"hmmmm, so who is this about?\" It was pretty obvious that it would feature many characters, but I thought the introduction to Batman was amazing. Ben Affleck nailed the part, not only as Batman but also as Bruce Wayne. He is my Batman. Henry Cavill continued to be super as the Man of Steel. And he is my Super - Man. A dark story? Yes, without a doubt. Could it have had a few more jokes? Sure. But not all movies or stories need to have jokes when certain events are serious. I really hope people can see this review and take another look at the movie, because, I loved it. I really hope the ratings can go up, eventually. And P.S, this movie is the perfect set up to Justice League."

"This film is crucial to the extended universe that DC is trying to build, but it feels highly derivative of better stories and continues to demonstrate the misuse of the iconic characters mentioned in the title. Plus Jesse Eisenberg feels wildly mis-casted."

"I'll start by making it clear I have only ever seen the Ultimate Edition. I'm aware of what was cut out for the theatrical release, so I will concede up front that most of the criticisms about pacing, editing, and missing bits of plot at release were merited.With that caveat out of the way, I must reiterate that this was bar-none the boldest superhero movie I have ever seen. To me, it was arguably the best as well, though \"best\" shouldn't be taken to mean \"most enjoyable.\" That honor easily goes to \"Thor: Ragnarok.\" What makes BvS stand out among other films in the genre is that it takes two characters who have been done to death since the 1970s and brings them up to date. I recently tried to watch \"Superman: The Movie\" for the first time in a number of years, and while it was still good and Reeves will always be iconic, I just couldn't take it seriously. I'll put it this way: If the story in BvS was \"stupid\" in your view but Superman turning back time by spinning the earth backward on its axis didn't seem like one of the dumbest things you have ever seen -in any movie from any genre- to the extent that it outright ruins the movie for you, then your opinion about BvS isn't worth much. Nostalgic bias was always going to be a problem for this movie, and the way people reacted to and reviewed \"Man of Steel\" was telling in this regard.That brings me to Zack Snyder's take on Superman. You know, that guy whose status as the first extraterrestrial ever encountered by humanity was a total non-issue in the old movies. Apparently, Snyder has a similar view to my own in that his take on the Man of Steel makes his being an alien a core piece of his identity. He may look like any other (absurdly attractive) person, but he knows what he is, and that makes him perpetually uncertain of where he fits in this world. He is essentially good and really does care about people, but he struggles to truly empathize with the likes of us. To be human is to be frail, and that is not something he can easily relate to. This is the root of his conflict with Batman.Just as Clark struggles to genuinely relate to most people, Snyder's Batman either refuses to or otherwise just can't relate to Superman. He doesn't see him as anything but a threat regardless of Superman's clear good intentions. Remember, a small group of Kryptonians were able to bring humanity to the brink of extinction in less than a day, and Bruce Wayne is nothing if not a realist. He didn't know the guy from Kansas. He only knew the god from another world.While Batman's anger toward and fear of Superman are readily apparent from the start, Superman's inability to imagine things from Bruce Wayne's perspective only becomes truly apparent during their first real interaction. This reminded me of the animated version of the \"world's finest\" storyline, where Superman judges Batman harshly for using fear tactics and threats of violence (also, actual violence) to get the job done. Superman wasn't willing to consider what it would take for a human man to fight criminals and save innocents, or what that life would do to him over time. Just as Batman didn't see the guy from Kansas, Superman didn't see the man who lives his life trapped in one brutal, unthinkably traumatic moment (this was beautifully conveyed during the film's opening moments), and had spent his whole adult life bearing witness to humanity at its absolute worst.The conflict between these two characters is as old as human history. They want the same things, but they can't understand one another. So they fight. And what a fight it was.Watching a fight between, say, Captain America and Iron Man was, to me, more frustrating than anything because each understood the other's perspective perfectly. The fight between Batman and Superman in BvS was genuinely gut-wrenching, as intended, because they would have understood one another if either had tried. The whole sequence hilighted Batman's tactical prowess and ability to control a situation. Maybe the most badass thing about the fight was that it ended exactly where Batman planned. That brings me to the big elephant in the room named \"Martha.\"I can't recall exactly which YouTuber put it this way, but if you thought the \"save Martha\" exchange was about their mothers having the same name, you had your brain turned off. The brain-on people have explained this to death, but it bears repeating. This was the moment when Superman became humanized to Batman. He was about to die, and his only concern was for his adoptive human mother. He still believed that the man about to take his life would do the right thing. Even with the cowl on, there was no mistaking the look on Batman's face. It was the look of shame, guilt, and sudden uncertainty that says \"What am I doing?\" Turns out even the most brutal, angry version of Bruce Wayne is better than Tony Stark at knowing right from wrong. At knowing that he had gone too far.From there, the third act was a series of truly impressive (albeit mostly CGI) fight sequences, beginning with what I regard as the undisputed champion of Batman fights. Nothing in the Nolan movies (and especially nothing in the Burton movies) even came close. Go ahead, try to convince yourself that Batman and Bane taking turns punching one another in the face until Bane's mask broke was a good fight sequence. No, this was a fight straight out of \"Arkham Knight,\" and it was glorious. The battle against Doomsday really was one for the books. From the moment Wonder Woman arrived accompanied by the intense sounds of Tina Guo's electric cello to Superman's tragic, heroic death at the hands of Doomsday, I was glued to the screen. Sure, the mere presence of Doomsday spoiled the end to a degree, but watching the Man of Steel laboring to carry that kryptonite spear towards certain death was no less impactful. A brief word on Jesse Eisenberg's take on Lex Luthor. At least one other reviewer on this site already said it best when they pointed out that this was his origin story. If you consider his scheme objectively, he is actually one of the more formidable incarnations of the character. If we're lucky, we'll eventually get to see a Snyder Cut of \"Justice League\" and find out where this story was actually meant to go. For the record, Joss Whedon and Danny Elfman both should have said \"no\" to taking a dump on someone else's art."
"BATMAN V SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE brings a fantastic surprise to a smash-hit team-up with one of the worlds most beloved DC Comics' icons of all time. The movie delivers spectacular casting, and fantastic acting with different characters having their shine in each scenes.The story follows Clark Kent/Superman who becomes a threat, after the destruction in Metropolis in Man Of Steel.(2013). Batman/Bruce Wayne sees him as a threat and begins his war on Superman.The movie brings spectacular storytelling, it tells the complications of human against alien who are on the same side, and the first meeting of Batman and Superman. The story of Bruce Wayne, with his many years of The Caped Crusader, sends him on a spiral of \"out of control\", sheer anger, and builds tension to wanting to defeat the Man of Steel. Snyder has fantastically gave this storytelling an exciting nod to the comics.Lex Luthor, played by Jesse Einsberg, delivers a very interesting performance, but very differently by him showing is his \"origin\" before he becomes a bald foe to the Man of Steel. He shows that his love of \"god vs man\" terrorises mankind when he ultimately creates Doomsday, and Batman realises Superman's inner heroism.It packs so many great \"out of nowhere\" excitement, including a first-look of the fearful Wonder Woman a.k.a. Diana Prince, played by Gal Gadot, and a fresh-new glimpse of the superhero DC canon: The Justice League.WATCH THIS MOVIE! The critics are out of their mind. It's a fun-packed action adventure which still keeps the movie enjoyable until it's final minutes of the movie. It's a FANTASTIC MOVIE! BEN AFFLECK AS BATMAN... is Incredible!A 10/10 overall!"
"I want to go on record as saying that this is a truly thrilling cinematic experience in so many ways. If pressed, I guess I could acknowledge that there were a couple ... let's say \"clumsy\" moments. And in a film that runs to three hours, that hardly seems like a significant issue, certainly not enough to rate it with fewer than 9 stars.This film has everything. There is dramatic tension right from the start. There is a magnificent story arc that picks up quite seamlessly from 'Man of Steel' and propels the viewer not only into the life of Clark Kent/Superman but also of Bruce Wayne/Batman.The villain is no mere cartoon of a villain; he is truly thoroughly (and apparently irrevocably) diabolical. He is a psychopath, and you wish for his death over and over and over. You want Superman to reduce him to ash with the power of his eyes.I have read a number of viewers' reviews, and it seems that the people who disliked the film / gave it a low rating had rather unfair and unrealistic expectations of it. That is, their own prejudices about how the plot could/should unfold or what the character development could/should be, etc. ruined the film for them. And that is a shame.My thought is: I settle into my seat, wait for the lights to dim, and then I wait to be transported by the film. I accept it, lock, stock, and barrel.As another reviewer remarked, I love how the film begins from the point of view of Bruce Wayne as he is among people on the ground who have fallen victim to the attack of Zod and the other Kryptonians.Why would Bruce Wayne not like Superman? Why would the good people of Earth hurl insults at Superman and burn him in effigy (on the news)? Because the good people of Earth just got catapulted into a new reality in which there are not only extraterrestrial beings (surprise!) but they are also superman! And a group of them are hell-bent on destroying humankind and taking the planet for themselves.It is difficult to see Superman as separate from the whole Kryptonian Krew.It seems that many moviegoers forgot that Bruce Wayne is also human. Sure, he's a hero, but he is flawed.. Just like the rest of us. He is a vigilante, after all.He has let his vigilantism get the better of him. HE is actually the one working outside the boundaries of the law, not Superman. It is the clear head of Alfred that shows us that he has gone into a rather dark place, that he has not seen what is really going on (in Luthor's scheme), and so he chooses to embark on his own scheme scheme to take out the alien invader. He is (allegedly) thinking of the future: if he wipes out the all-powerful alien, then it can't turn on humankind in the future. At least, he convinces himself of that.A philosophical question is raised in the film: should Clark Kent have remained a simple man from Kansas and never have become the Superman? Should he just let people die and let calamities happen? The question is answered for us in the character of Diana Prince/Wonder Woman. She withdrew from mankind (her exact words) and just sat around watching. Watching while people died horrible deaths all around her. So, should Superman have done the same? Do these special beings, these 'metahumans', have some kind of moral imperative to intervene, or should they be allowed to be regular people, too? It seems that humans want it both ways.It seems that humans are saying: \"Don't be a superalien ... except when I and my friends and family are in trouble. Then come save us.\""

"Batman v Superman: Ultimate Edition: If your looking for a quick, cheap thrill then you might not enjoy this film at the time. This movies theatrical version was butchered by WB and in doing so reshaped the story leaving numerous plot holes. So the Ultimate Edition is the full story and the one worth seeing. Watch 'Man of Steel' before seeing this movie. There is much to claw through here, so much so that the audience might easily find themselves exhausted from the overall aggression of the film. However, a lot of the story does work. The action is good, and the emotion feels real most of the time.This film is about Superman trying to become Superman. Trying to help the world, save people, find a place in this world not as an outcast, and yet is looked at has a threat by many. Superman is not from this world, yet He is trying to be human, find a place in this world, be excepted by earths people, and come into his destiny.This film is also about Batman being Batman for 20 years and losing faith in humanity, and fearing Superman, what Superman can do with his powers. Great film, great plot, great visuals. ---Yidioo"
"I didn't see the film in the theaters and just bought the \"Extended Edition \" on Amazon. I never properly saw Man of Steel- i think I rented it and watched it when already exhausted and fell asleep. I saw the mediocre user reviews and horrible reviews from critics of this film.They really have it wrong. This is the very best either Batman or Superman. It has a different take, on things. Much darker then earlier films even darker then the Christopher Nolan Batman films.First of all Christopher Nolan is an Executive Producer. So how bad could it be? I loved Sucker Punch and Zack Snyder was involved with that. So how bad could this be? Hans Zimmer did the music, so how bad could it be?I remember watching the old Superman TV shows and reading the Superman and Batman comics as a little kid and loved them, but i wouldn't call myself a \"fan boy\" of comic universes, like so many younger people today. As an older adult I will admit my favorite TV show of all time was Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but watched it on DVD only after it had finished. I saw the second of the Dark Knight series in the theater, but the other two, I watched on DVD. They were great, but not my favorite films like so many people. i also loved the first couple Superman and Batman films in the older series. Regardless, i was not waiting with baited breath to see Man of Steel or this one.I'm more of a serious film fan, who can watch Stanley Kubrick films over and over and my favorite films in the last twenty years, are Eyes Wide Shut and Intersteller, both of which i've watched multiple times.So, with that said, take it from me, the critics have this film very wrong, just as critics hated 2001: A Space Odyssey when it first came out. This film will have lasting appreciation.Surprised how much I liked Ben Afleck's Batman. it was hard to get into Henry Cavil's scrawnier looking Superman, but it grew on me. Amy Adams was great as Lois Lane, The Gal Gadol Wonder Women was amazing. Lex Luther was terrific, like Nolan's Joker. Jeremy Irons was the best Alfred ever. Holly Hunter and Diane Lane was good too. The movie had bad reviews but made a billion dollars. Hopefully everyone buys the Ultimate Edition and it breaks sales records and the film is re-appreciated. I have no idea what scenes this Ultimate Edition added, but it is pretty perfect. Now I can't wait for Wonder Woman and the Justice League and as soon as I finish writing this am going to watch Man of Steal. I'm into it now!I can only surmise that the bad reviews stem from too much expectations of the rigid fan boy types and the radical changes in tone, we see in this film.Total masterpiece of cinema, but I have a few criticisms. There are a few hollow scenes of typical Idiot cops and authorities getting everything wrong in a cliché type way and it has a few filler scenes of that type and a few moments here and there that felt rushed and cheesy. Maybe not everything restored into the Ultimate Edition should have been. I wish there had been more Kevin Costner scenes."

"The whole entire Batman V Superman movie was great and yes even though it felt slow to the majority of the people who watched it but to me I enjoyed every part and every scene of Batman V Superman and when it got to the fight scenes both batman VS Superman and the Doomsday fight it brought so much drama, intensity, and epic performances. So with that being said I give this movie a good 10/10 because it really did go to my expectations and it brought a powerful performance and a powerful yet epic introduction to the upcoming Justice League."

"When I first wrote a review for this movie a year ago exclaiming my excitement for the film, I had been high off a fresh dose of live-action DC superheroes playing out the beloved comic book stories that I had grown up on. It was all playing out before my eyes and coming to life. After a few months had passed, I began to notice things about the movie that I disliked: little gaps in the story, things that didn't add up, etc. My original rating of a 10 / 10 dropped to an 8 /10. But today it has gone back up to a 10. The extended version of the film not only rectifies the gaps but also silences critics.Many claimed that the movie was too dark or that it just didn't make sense. To those people, I say: \"Pick up a comic book!\" Many of the critics of this particular film were part of the superhero bandwagon that formed when Marvel began its spree of Avengers-related films. In fact, its estimated that over 60% of people who go to see 'superhero' genre films have never picked up a comic book in their life. I would argue that similar numbers could figure to those which view the CW televised DC Universe shows. People complain that DC comics is just too dark but the fact is that these movies are based upon actual comics which are meant to be dark (ex: The Dark Knight Returns, Injustice, etc.). Its like complaining that Game of Thrones (the TV series) sucks because they kill off too many characters. Read the books! Its frustrating to see such a beautiful work of art like Batman V Superman criticized by those ignorant to its universe and its meaning. This movie is in fact a catalyst that opens numerous doorways and leaves true fans in awe of the possibilities for future movies. But regardless of whether or not people choose to educate themselves, this film's DVD/Blu-ray extended version puts the theater release to shame. All of the plot holes and gaps are filled in 30 minutes of extended footage scattered throughout the film. The movie ultimately becomes more complete and people will wish that the movie had shown the full 3 hours of footage in its theatrical debut. As a major DC comics fan, I will of course pick up on things that a comics fan would not, but someone who does not read comics would learn to appreciate this film in its entirety with the extended version. Get your hands on a copy today or find it on Netflix or the internet somewhere!"

"I ignored the bad reviews and watched anyways. This film had a lot to live up to after Civil War was released and I went into this film expecting the worst. It ended up to be the best Superhero film of 2016 to me. One complaint was that this film was more concerned about universe building than telling a great story than Civil War but for me it was the other way around; Civil War felt like a build up to something else and to be honest, I felt that way when I saw the other MCU films. Batman vs Superman however not only had a great story, but it also felt a lot more consistent than Civil War. This film was way more diverse with the cast than the MCU but unlike the MCU, I felt like this film doesn't go overboard with the SJW stuff like the MCU films or The Star Wars Sequel films do. The Visuals were AMAZING, The Score by Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL was AMAZING as well, The Tone is just right as I actually felt for the characters emotionally, The Cinematography kept my eyes glued to the screen, and the script felt really Intelligent and Complex and despite people calling the writing confusing, I was able to piece it together with no problem whatsoever. This film is similar to Empire Strikes back in terms of popularity so over time after the other movies are released, this movie would probably be more popular.This film was way better than I Expected and deserves another chance.

"Its shame to see what critics and marvel fans did to this movie and targeted Zack Snyder for it. I have seen this movie more than 25 times till date. And i enjoy this movie as much as i enjoyed the first time. The fans who have read DC comics, wouldn't be disappointed in this movie. Its dark movie, yes it is. Because the title shows the intense situation at hand. Two superheroes about to rip each other apart for whatever reasons that brought them to this stage. Yes it had to be dark and intense.Only marvel can be stupid enough to show an alien invasion where humans are loosing the battle and the super heroes are cracking jokes while battles as if they are playing ping pong. a person playing Call of Duty game is more serious while playing than the marvel heroes fighting aliens."

"Last week some news came out from somebody online who had claimed to have seen a finished version of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. If you were like me, you've been leery of checking it out because you weren't sure how much might actually be true. Now Zack Snyder has spoken out about the spoiler-filled post, although his response doesn't really clear anything up.In a word, to MTV, he called the post \"hilarious,which might imply that he's saying that it's mostly, if not entirely, untrue. That might be the case, but then again he could have just said it was untrue and he didn't say that. What he did say, however, is that he doesn't like spoilers. While this may seem odd for the director who's most recent trailer appeared to give away the entire movie, Snyder says that's not the case. Even if you've seen the trailer, you can rest easy, as there is much more we have not seen in then finished film. Says Snyder I have the benefit of seeing the movie. It's cool that think it's too much, and I appreciate people not wanting to know, but there's plenty that they don't know. There's a lot of movie that's not in the trailer. In the process of calling the Batman v Superman Reddit review hilarious, Snyder goes on to talk about how he hates it when spoilers come out. The director would much rather that fans see the movie mostly blind. While he understands that some fans may wish to find the answers before hand, he wants his movies to be mysteries going in. If you're, as an audience member, exploring these articles, looking for answers to questions that you have, maybe you're okay with knowing before you go. It's like an individual taste. But like I said, I want people to see the movie without knowing.Spoilers are a topic that mean different things to different people. While most try to avoid them to some degree, the need to solve the mystery is a nearly universal human experience. We have an inclination to want to know the truth, even while also wanting to be surprised. For most of us getting some information is good, but getting all the information is bad, of course, only getting the details that you want can be difficult."
"The theatrical is choppy, poorly edited, hard to follow, with some really good moments mixed in their. The extended is much more fluent and is much easier to follow, it does have a long runtime, which might make it seem a bit dragging on, but if you like long films done right, like Lord of the Rings, you will like this movie as long as you get into the characters and story. Speaking of which, the story starts out perfectly showing Bruce Wayne as a character, and it is very powerful. There are several moments in this movie that are powerful, emotional, and shocking. Characters. Batman is my favorite fictional character of all time, and believe me when I say, Ben Affleck as Batman was perfect, he had the charisma, the anger, and the look of being through some bad stuff Gal Gadot also does perfect as Wonder Woman, but if you want to really see how good she does, go watch the Wonder Woman movie. Henry Call as Superman. I really don't like it when people say Christopher Reeves is better. Don't get me wrong, Reeves does great, but can you imagine him as Superman in this movie? I wouldn't like it. It would be like Adam West playing Batman in The Dark Knight. Henry Cavill does great in this role, I can say everything about him as I said with Ben Affleck. Jesse Eisenberg as Luthor. I thought it was different in a good way. I've heard a criticism for him as being too much like Joker, but is that a bad thing? Joker is my favorite villain, so to see Superman have an enemy that crazy, but still hold the values Luthor needs to be Luthor, I think it is great. The thing I thought this movie was lacking in the first and second acts was humor, at least good humor. If there was more humor, I would've given this movie a ten because it would give a more relaxing feel to the parts that needed it. All in all though, this movie was awesome, it had powerful moments, it was badass, and just plain fun. It had a great story arc and does its job very well."

"*I will be talking about the Ultimate Edition of the film* This was one of the most anticipated CBM of all time. Ever since the arrival and subsequent success of Marvel's The Avengers people have wondered when will DC launch its own cinematic universe, one of the main reasons being the opportunity to finally see titans such as Batman and Superman share the screen together: the ultimate nerd dream. On 2016, the moment finally came for BvS to be released AND.. it performed poorly. Not only did critical reception left a lot to be desired, but fan reactions where surprisingly split after its cinematic debut. People either loved it and called Zack a genius, or hated it and called him a hack. Me, personally, I found myself with middle of the road feelings, for sure, but more leaning towards the negative side with subsequent viewings. The theatrical cut of the film showcased amazing performances, incredible visuals, and action set pieces that seemed like comic book panels come to life, in a good way. However, when it comes to its narrative structure and more technical aspects like editing, the film was seriously flawed. More plot holes than Age of Ultron, questionable character decisions, random editing that lacked cohesion and focus, and forced dramatic moments that lacked any impact because the attempts at character development ranged from limited to nonexistent, especially when it comes to Superman's character. I thought it was a 5/10 movie at best. As such, I was kind of skeptical about the idea of a 30 minute longer version. I say kind of because I know how Zack works. I remember Watchmen being vastly improved with its director's cut, so in a way I was expecting BvS to perform in a similar manner, but I also feared those 30 minutes wold be just there to amplify action and discredit storytelling issues. Oh boy, I'm so glad I was proved wrong. The ultimate cut of the film was infuriating, but not because it was awful, but because it questions the sanity of WB executives and editors and makes you wonder what were they thinking during the editing process. What I got out of the Ultimate Edition was a thought-provoking deconstruction of two very iconic superheroes that gave spotlight to the struggles both of them face when they aren't fighting crime. What I got was an extremely well produced character study on both Batman and Superman in a cynical world, a world dangerously close to our own. We meet Batman as a ruthless, worn out hero that has seen the failure behind his ideals and witnessed some truly horrifying things in his life. Superman, on the other hand, is portrayed as a godlike figure that seeks to do good in the world, but finds himself emotionally conflicted once he realized that every good deed he does leaves behind a trail of destruction (most of it due to Luthor's antics). In my opinion, this is a hugely original approach, one that distances itself from the rest of the competition and delivers a dark, somber, yet relevant superhero movie that understands both characters and gives them real human struggles to deal with. I felt invested in both of them, and hoped that by the end of the film both could find a way to redeem themselves. Their character arcs were very well established during the first two acts of the movie, and by the time we get to the titular climactic battle the emotion behind the jaw-dropping action is intensified. Lex Luthor as a villain was also given more time to develop with this new edition. One of the main criticisms with the original version was the fact that his plan relied too much on conveniences, and the character's mannerisms and mad-scientist attitude was annoying, and that goes without saying his motivations were unclear. Not only do we spend more time understanding his hate for any godlike figure and thus his hatred for Superman, but the added scenes allowed us to witness his entire plan come to fruition. It sells the cold, manipulative, calculating attributes of his comic counterpart. The acting is spot on. Every actor owns his/her role, from Cavill's Superman, to Ben Affleck as Batman, Eisenberg as Luthor, and Gadot as Wonder Woman, whose scenes are brief, but are more than enough to sell the strong and ferocious warrior that she is. Cinematography is stunning, and miles above that of Man of Steel's. And the soundtrack by Zimmer and Junkie XL? Perfect, just perfect. When it comes to flaws, the film still has some of those. The Martha moment, while serving as a pivotal character moment for Batman, felt off in execution, and its understandable that many people got mad at it. If your main complaint about BvS the first time around was its bleak tone and subject matter, this film is still not for you. I understand most were expecting to see the heroes being the most iconic versions of themselves, clashing in an elongated battle and evoking the same feelings The Avengers gave audiences back in 2012. In that sense, the film will remain divisive, but at least I have the comfort of saying that, at the very least, the film is competently made."

"This film was amazing. Ben Affleck was easily the best part of this movie, he brought his a-game as Batman. The chemistry between Affleck & Irons was outstanding. Gal Gadot did a great job as Wonder Woman. The fight between Batman & Superman was awesome. The final fight with Doomsday was outstanding in every way possible. However, there is only one problem with this film and that's Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor. He was sadly missed cast in this role, but then again it's really the fault of Warner Bros. Studios. Overall, this film deliver on almost every level. I highly recommend that you watch the extended version of this film."

"I know I know. I saw it in theaters too, and felt like it could've been so much better. While the Batman element was good, the narrative felt fractured, and the third act was just one long stunt scene. Superman was relegated to a supporting character, and other characters didn't get a chance to shine. And then I chanced on the ultimate cut. Calling it 30 mins of \"extra\" footage is unfair to Zack Snyder because it's exactly these 30 mins that makes the movie a worthy one. What I can say about the theatrical cut is this - It had the blockbuster elements - music, visuals, stunts, CGI. But, it lacked the human elements. The first 20 mins of the movie had it, but not after that. The extended cut in comparison has a flow to the narrative. There are no disjointed scenes, everything flows smoothly, and there's connective tissue. Superman gets to spend some time with his father, and mother. Clark Kent does some investigative journalism. Superman helps the people after the blast. Lois Lane doesn't jump to conclusions, she gets to the bottom of the crime. Lex Luthor apparently had a coherent plan - everything is explained pretty well. Wonder Woman was already good, so there's no change there :) Also, the \"Martha\" scene seems better executed, because it is a few seconds longer, and there's time to breathe it in. So, here's my take on this movie - The theatrical cut was junk. Get the Bluray for ultimate edition, and you shall not be disappointed. I've seen it so many more times now, and it's the definitive cut. It is the movie we deserve. It's a unique take on Batman, and Superman. It's a gritty take on the superhero movie genre, and definitely the best DCEU movie, and the best DC movie since The Dark Knight.P.S. Yes it's dark. We're adults, and we should appreciate mature film making without intentionally silly moments. It attempts to be philosophical, and something deep instead of just trying to make you chuckle."

"This is one of the best superhero movies ever made. Zack Snyder is a magician behind the camera.The reason behind so many complaints is the fact that Warner Bros. marketed this movie as a fight between Batman and Superman. That's not what it is. It's a movie about the origins of the Justice League.The cinematography, the acting and the score are all second to none. This film is phenomenal.P.S: watch the 3 hour extended cut that Snyder intended you to see, not the 2 and a half hour movie that Warner Bros. decided would be better for theaters."

"I don't care what the critics say, this is a very well-done movie. I'll start my review by listing what I like about the movie.1.) Ben Affleck is the best batman to me and it is not close. He pulls off the role of an aging batman extremely well. Also, Zack Snyder's vision of batman is legit. I have always hated batman up until this adaptation of him. Instead of being a conflicted and idealistic batman, this batman is dark, gritty, and 100% a badass. His equipment is decked out with machine guns and he has no aversion to killing people. In fact, he probably kills about 50 criminal by the time this movie is over. The warehouse scene is the coolest batman scene in any movie.2.) The development of a grudge between batman and superman is pulled off flawlessly. It actually makes sense why batman dislikes superman. Then, when they do fight it is about the coolest thing you can expect to see from a superhero film. 3.) I disagree with a lot of people about Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor. In my opinion, he played his role to perfection. 4.) B v S sets up Wonder Woman and Justice League with Gal Gadot's cameo as Wonder Woman and short clips of Aquaman, the Flash, and Cyborg. B v S is one of my favorite superhero films and rewatching it never gets old."

"The theatrical cut of this film is garbage which is why I rated it eight stars instead of nine. The first time I watched this film I didn't like it (not straight out hate but didn't like). Character motivations didn't make any sense, Lex was annoying as s***, editing was sloppy, and it was overly dark and broody for an action superhero movie. A year + a half, five Marvel films, a ton of bad reviews and a Justice League later a thought popped into my head: \"what if I watched BVS again\". This time I didn't have trailers ruining the best moments, I only vaguely remembered the film, and I was conditioned to look at it negatively but something unexpected happened: I actually loved it. Superman was just a normal person that tried to make a difference cause he could that others imposed their own beliefs on. Lex Luthor was a genius that couldn't stand his powerlessness compared to Superman or more accurately a super being. As Alfred said \"The fever, the rage, the feeling of powerlessness that turns good men... cruel\" and you see the same thought process in Batman. Batman, just like Lex Luthor feels powerless in the midst of a god-being and just like Lex he attempts to destroy him so he can get his sense of power back but unlike Lex, Batman learns something. I what is one of the corniest lines of the movie Superman says, \"Martha\" when he knows he can't win against Batman in a late desperate attempt to save his mother. Not only does this name connect with Bruce Wayne but it also shows what really matters to a man of steel: it isn't power, it isn't fame or anything else, it is his Mother and on a broader scale it is people. Lex (who doesn't care about people at all) knows he doesn't have the power so he creates something from his blood and the remains of Zod: A Doomsday for Superman. Not only does this film have depth but it also doesn't always explain it to you which is rare in a blockbuster action superhero flick normally cater to semi-comic book fans and people that want to shove popcorn in their mouths. This film rewards you for really noticing the details while still having massive explosions. One of my favorites is how Lex has all of Batman's branded killed which is why he isn't afraid of the branding at the end or Grandma's Peach Tea as a way of scaring the s*** out of someone. Of course, this film isn't perfect and I do have personal dislikes. The Batman V Superman fight was slow and pretty boring especially after watching such an amazing fight in Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 2 (If you haven't watched the animated Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 1 and 2 you are sorely missing out on something fantastic). Also, the addition of Wonder Woman who pretty much steals a hacker thing, gives it back and then suits up and fights against a giant monster thing. Not to say I don't like Wonder Woman (She is one of my favorite Superheroes of all time who showed not only can woman kick a** but they also don't need to be ashamed of their sexuality or gender) but she wasn't really that helpful to the plot and just brought in to expand the universe which was well done through Lex's superhuman hunting files. Also, the post-apocalyptic scene that was just a dream could have been cut but nothing is perfect except movies like Citizen Kane which isn't a lot of fun to watch cause it is too perfect. So to summarize, the theatrical cut is bad, the ultimate cut is Amazing and the other cut is meh. Please give it a second chance because it deserves it and save a good director from losing grace because of something he didn't do."
"I really liked it, don't know what all the hate is about. I'm actually a Marvel fan from when I was 7 or so, but Superman and Batman together in 1 movie? Just great. And personally I like Ben Affleck even better than Christian Bale as Batman. So just watch and enjoy, I know I did!"

"That's right. We have been waiting for these two heroes to finally meet and fight against each other. This movie is so good in both plot and special effects.Henry Cavill and Ben Affleck have performed well in their acting stages. They are the best superhero actors and they have filmed their fighting scenes very well. The movie starts to show the conflict between the lives of the heroes and now they have blamed each other for it. This movie is amazing and sets up a good plot for Dawn Justice."

"Actually...I didn't know what to expect. When you see Wonder Woman, you know it will be off of Wonder Woman and off of a Wonder Woman story, but with Batman V Superman, I was like, \"hmmmm, so who is this about?\" It was pretty obvious that it would feature many characters, but I thought the introduction to Batman was amazing. Ben Affleck nailed the part, not only as Batman but also as Bruce Wayne. He is my Batman. Henry Cavill continued to be super as the Man of Steel. And he is my Super - Man. A dark story? Yes, without a doubt. Could it have had a few more jokes? Sure. But not all movies or stories need to have jokes when certain events are serious. I really hope people can see this review and take another look at the movie, because, I loved it. I really hope the ratings can go up, eventually. And P.S, this movie is the perfect set up to Justice League."

"I'll start by making it clear I have only ever seen the Ultimate Edition. I'm aware of what was cut out for the theatrical release, so I will concede up front that most of the criticisms about pacing, editing, and missing bits of plot at release were merited.With that caveat out of the way, I must reiterate that this was bar-none the boldest superhero movie I have ever seen. To me, it was arguably the best as well, though \"best\" shouldn't be taken to mean \"most enjoyable.\" That honor easily goes to \"Thor: Ragnarok.\" What makes BvS stand out among other films in the genre is that it takes two characters who have been done to death since the 1970s and brings them up to date. I recently tried to watch \"Superman: The Movie\" for the first time in a number of years, and while it was still good and Reeves will always be iconic, I just couldn't take it seriously. I'll put it this way: If the story in BvS was \"stupid\" in your view but Superman turning back time by spinning the earth backward on its axis didn't seem like one of the dumbest things you have ever seen -in any movie from any genre- to the extent that it outright ruins the movie for you, then your opinion about BvS isn't worth much. Nostalgic bias was always going to be a problem for this movie, and the way people reacted to and reviewed \"Man of Steel\" was telling in this regard.That brings me to Zack Snyder's take on Superman. You know, that guy whose status as the first extraterrestrial ever encountered by humanity was a total non-issue in the old movies. Apparently, Snyder has a similar view to my own in that his take on the Man of Steel makes his being an alien a core piece of his identity. He may look like any other (absurdly attractive) person, but he knows what he is, and that makes him perpetually uncertain of where he fits in this world. He is essentially good and really does care about people, but he struggles to truly empathize with the likes of us. To be human is to be frail, and that is not something he can easily relate to. This is the root of his conflict with Batman.Just as Clark struggles to genuinely relate to most people, Snyder's Batman either refuses to or otherwise just can't relate to Superman. He doesn't see him as anything but a threat regardless of Superman's clear good intentions. Remember, a small group of Kryptonians were able to bring humanity to the brink of extinction in less than a day, and Bruce Wayne is nothing if not a realist. He didn't know the guy from Kansas. He only knew the god from another world.While Batman's anger toward and fear of Superman are readily apparent from the start, Superman's inability to imagine things from Bruce Wayne's perspective only becomes truly apparent during their first real interaction. This reminded me of the animated version of the \"world's finest\" storyline, where Superman judges Batman harshly for using fear tactics and threats of violence (also, actual violence) to get the job done. Superman wasn't willing to consider what it would take for a human man to fight criminals and save innocents, or what that life would do to him over time. Just as Batman didn't see the guy from Kansas, Superman didn't see the man who lives his life trapped in one brutal, unthinkably traumatic moment (this was beautifully conveyed during the film's opening moments), and had spent his whole adult life bearing witness to humanity at its absolute worst.The conflict between these two characters is as old as human history. They want the same things, but they can't understand one another. So they fight. And what a fight it was.Watching a fight between, say, Captain America and Iron Man was, to me, more frustrating than anything because each understood the other's perspective perfectly. The fight between Batman and Superman in BvS was genuinely gut-wrenching, as intended, because they would have understood one another if either had tried. The whole sequence hilighted Batman's tactical prowess and ability to control a situation. Maybe the most badass thing about the fight was that it ended exactly where Batman planned. That brings me to the big elephant in the room named \"Martha.\"I can't recall exactly which YouTuber put it this way, but if you thought the \"save Martha\" exchange was about their mothers having the same name, you had your brain turned off. The brain-on people have explained this to death, but it bears repeating. This was the moment when Superman became humanized to Batman. He was about to die, and his only concern was for his adoptive human mother. He still believed that the man about to take his life would do the right thing. Even with the cowl on, there was no mistaking the look on Batman's face. It was the look of shame, guilt, and sudden uncertainty that says \"What am I doing?\" Turns out even the most brutal, angry version of Bruce Wayne is better than Tony Stark at knowing right from wrong. At knowing that he had gone too far.From there, the third act was a series of truly impressive (albeit mostly CGI) fight sequences, beginning with what I regard as the undisputed champion of Batman fights. Nothing in the Nolan movies (and especially nothing in the Burton movies) even came close. Go ahead, try to convince yourself that Batman and Bane taking turns punching one another in the face until Bane's mask broke was a good fight sequence. No, this was a fight straight out of \"Arkham Knight,\" and it was glorious. The battle against Doomsday really was one for the books. From the moment Wonder Woman arrived accompanied by the intense sounds of Tina Guo's electric cello to Superman's tragic, heroic death at the hands of Doomsday, I was glued to the screen. Sure, the mere presence of Doomsday spoiled the end to a degree, but watching the Man of Steel laboring to carry that kryptonite spear towards certain death was no less impactful. A brief word on Jesse Eisenberg's take on Lex Luthor. At least one other reviewer on this site already said it best when they pointed out that this was his origin story. If you consider his scheme objectively, he is actually one of the more formidable incarnations of the character. If we're lucky, we'll eventually get to see a Snyder Cut of \"Justice League\" and find out where this story was actually meant to go. For the record, Joss Whedon and Danny Elfman both should have said \"no\" to taking a dump on someone else's art."
"BATMAN V SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE brings a fantastic surprise to a smash-hit team-up with one of the worlds most beloved DC Comics' icons of all time. The movie delivers spectacular casting, and fantastic acting with different characters having their shine in each scenes.The story follows Clark Kent/Superman who becomes a threat, after the destruction in Metropolis in Man Of Steel.(2013). Batman/Bruce Wayne sees him as a threat and begins his war on Superman.The movie brings spectacular storytelling, it tells the complications of human against alien who are on the same side, and the first meeting of Batman and Superman. The story of Bruce Wayne, with his many years of The Caped Crusader, sends him on a spiral of \"out of control\", sheer anger, and builds tension to wanting to defeat the Man of Steel. Snyder has fantastically gave this storytelling an exciting nod to the comics.Lex Luthor, played by Jesse Einsberg, delivers a very interesting performance, but very differently by him showing is his \"origin\" before he becomes a bald foe to the Man of Steel. He shows that his love of \"god vs man\" terrorises mankind when he ultimately creates Doomsday, and Batman realises Superman's inner heroism.It packs so many great \"out of nowhere\" excitement, including a first-look of the fearful Wonder Woman a.k.a. Diana Prince, played by Gal Gadot, and a fresh-new glimpse of the superhero DC canon: The Justice League.WATCH THIS MOVIE! The critics are out of their mind. It's a fun-packed action adventure which still keeps the movie enjoyable until it's final minutes of the movie. It's a FANTASTIC MOVIE! BEN AFFLECK AS BATMAN... is Incredible!A 10/10 overall!"
"I want to go on record as saying that this is a truly thrilling cinematic experience in so many ways. If pressed, I guess I could acknowledge that there were a couple ... let's say \"clumsy\" moments. And in a film that runs to three hours, that hardly seems like a significant issue, certainly not enough to rate it with fewer than 9 stars.This film has everything. There is dramatic tension right from the start. There is a magnificent story arc that picks up quite seamlessly from 'Man of Steel' and propels the viewer not only into the life of Clark Kent/Superman but also of Bruce Wayne/Batman.The villain is no mere cartoon of a villain; he is truly thoroughly (and apparently irrevocably) diabolical. He is a psychopath, and you wish for his death over and over and over. You want Superman to reduce him to ash with the power of his eyes.I have read a number of viewers' reviews, and it seems that the people who disliked the film / gave it a low rating had rather unfair and unrealistic expectations of it. That is, their own prejudices about how the plot could/should unfold or what the character development could/should be, etc. ruined the film for them. And that is a shame.My thought is: I settle into my seat, wait for the lights to dim, and then I wait to be transported by the film. I accept it, lock, stock, and barrel.As another reviewer remarked, I love how the film begins from the point of view of Bruce Wayne as he is among people on the ground who have fallen victim to the attack of Zod and the other Kryptonians.Why would Bruce Wayne not like Superman? Why would the good people of Earth hurl insults at Superman and burn him in effigy (on the news)? Because the good people of Earth just got catapulted into a new reality in which there are not only extraterrestrial beings (surprise!) but they are also superman! And a group of them are hell-bent on destroying humankind and taking the planet for themselves.It is difficult to see Superman as separate from the whole Kryptonian Krew.It seems that many moviegoers forgot that Bruce Wayne is also human. Sure, he's a hero, but he is flawed.. Just like the rest of us. He is a vigilante, after all.He has let his vigilantism get the better of him. HE is actually the one working outside the boundaries of the law, not Superman. It is the clear head of Alfred that shows us that he has gone into a rather dark place, that he has not seen what is really going on (in Luthor's scheme), and so he chooses to embark on his own scheme scheme to take out the alien invader. He is (allegedly) thinking of the future: if he wipes out the all-powerful alien, then it can't turn on humankind in the future. At least, he convinces himself of that.A philosophical question is raised in the film: should Clark Kent have remained a simple man from Kansas and never have become the Superman? Should he just let people die and let calamities happen? The question is answered for us in the character of Diana Prince/Wonder Woman. She withdrew from mankind (her exact words) and just sat around watching. Watching while people died horrible deaths all around her. So, should Superman have done the same? Do these special beings, these 'metahumans', have some kind of moral imperative to intervene, or should they be allowed to be regular people, too? It seems that humans want it both ways.It seems that humans are saying: \"Don't be a superalien ... except when I and my friends and family are in trouble. Then come save us.\""

"Batman v Superman: Ultimate Edition: If your looking for a quick, cheap thrill then you might not enjoy this film at the time. This movies theatrical version was butchered by WB and in doing so reshaped the story leaving numerous plot holes. So the Ultimate Edition is the full story and the one worth seeing. Watch 'Man of Steel' before seeing this movie. There is much to claw through here, so much so that the audience might easily find themselves exhausted from the overall aggression of the film. However, a lot of the story does work. The action is good, and the emotion feels real most of the time.This film is about Superman trying to become Superman. Trying to help the world, save people, find a place in this world not as an outcast, and yet is looked at has a threat by many. Superman is not from this world, yet He is trying to be human, find a place in this world, be excepted by earths people, and come into his destiny.This film is also about Batman being Batman for 20 years and losing faith in humanity, and fearing Superman, what Superman can do with his powers. Great film, great plot, great visuals. ---Yidioo"
"I didn't see the film in the theaters and just bought the \"Extended Edition \" on Amazon. I never properly saw Man of Steel- i think I rented it and watched it when already exhausted and fell asleep. I saw the mediocre user reviews and horrible reviews from critics of this film.They really have it wrong. This is the very best either Batman or Superman. It has a different take, on things. Much darker then earlier films even darker then the Christopher Nolan Batman films.First of all Christopher Nolan is an Executive Producer. So how bad could it be? I loved Sucker Punch and Zack Snyder was involved with that. So how bad could this be? Hans Zimmer did the music, so how bad could it be?I remember watching the old Superman TV shows and reading the Superman and Batman comics as a little kid and loved them, but i wouldn't call myself a \"fan boy\" of comic universes, like so many younger people today. As an older adult I will admit my favorite TV show of all time was Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but watched it on DVD only after it had finished. I saw the second of the Dark Knight series in the theater, but the other two, I watched on DVD. They were great, but not my favorite films like so many people. i also loved the first couple Superman and Batman films in the older series. Regardless, i was not waiting with baited breath to see Man of Steel or this one.I'm more of a serious film fan, who can watch Stanley Kubrick films over and over and my favorite films in the last twenty years, are Eyes Wide Shut and Intersteller, both of which i've watched multiple times.So, with that said, take it from me, the critics have this film very wrong, just as critics hated 2001: A Space Odyssey when it first came out. This film will have lasting appreciation.Surprised how much I liked Ben Afleck's Batman. it was hard to get into Henry Cavil's scrawnier looking Superman, but it grew on me. Amy Adams was great as Lois Lane, The Gal Gadol Wonder Women was amazing. Lex Luther was terrific, like Nolan's Joker. Jeremy Irons was the best Alfred ever. Holly Hunter and Diane Lane was good too. The movie had bad reviews but made a billion dollars. Hopefully everyone buys the Ultimate Edition and it breaks sales records and the film is re-appreciated. I have no idea what scenes this Ultimate Edition added, but it is pretty perfect. Now I can't wait for Wonder Woman and the Justice League and as soon as I finish writing this am going to watch Man of Steal. I'm into it now!I can only surmise that the bad reviews stem from too much expectations of the rigid fan boy types and the radical changes in tone, we see in this film.Total masterpiece of cinema, but I have a few criticisms. There are a few hollow scenes of typical Idiot cops and authorities getting everything wrong in a cliché type way and it has a few filler scenes of that type and a few moments here and there that felt rushed and cheesy. Maybe not everything restored into the Ultimate Edition should have been. I wish there had been more Kevin Costner scenes."

"The whole entire Batman V Superman movie was great and yes even though it felt slow to the majority of the people who watched it but to me I enjoyed every part and every scene of Batman V Superman and when it got to the fight scenes both batman VS Superman and the Doomsday fight it brought so much drama, intensity, and epic performances. So with that being said I give this movie a good 10/10 because it really did go to my expectations and it brought a powerful performance and a powerful yet epic introduction to the upcoming Justice League."

"When I first wrote a review for this movie a year ago exclaiming my excitement for the film, I had been high off a fresh dose of live-action DC superheroes playing out the beloved comic book stories that I had grown up on. It was all playing out before my eyes and coming to life. After a few months had passed, I began to notice things about the movie that I disliked: little gaps in the story, things that didn't add up, etc. My original rating of a 10 / 10 dropped to an 8 /10. But today it has gone back up to a 10. The extended version of the film not only rectifies the gaps but also silences critics.Many claimed that the movie was too dark or that it just didn't make sense. To those people, I say: \"Pick up a comic book!\" Many of the critics of this particular film were part of the superhero bandwagon that formed when Marvel began its spree of Avengers-related films. In fact, its estimated that over 60% of people who go to see 'superhero' genre films have never picked up a comic book in their life. I would argue that similar numbers could figure to those which view the CW televised DC Universe shows. People complain that DC comics is just too dark but the fact is that these movies are based upon actual comics which are meant to be dark (ex: The Dark Knight Returns, Injustice, etc.). Its like complaining that Game of Thrones (the TV series) sucks because they kill off too many characters. Read the books! Its frustrating to see such a beautiful work of art like Batman V Superman criticized by those ignorant to its universe and its meaning. This movie is in fact a catalyst that opens numerous doorways and leaves true fans in awe of the possibilities for future movies. But regardless of whether or not people choose to educate themselves, this film's DVD/Blu-ray extended version puts the theater release to shame. All of the plot holes and gaps are filled in 30 minutes of extended footage scattered throughout the film. The movie ultimately becomes more complete and people will wish that the movie had shown the full 3 hours of footage in its theatrical debut. As a major DC comics fan, I will of course pick up on things that a comics fan would not, but someone who does not read comics would learn to appreciate this film in its entirety with the extended version. Get your hands on a copy today or find it on Netflix or the internet somewhere!"

"I ignored the bad reviews and watched anyways. This film had a lot to live up to after Civil War was released and I went into this film expecting the worst. It ended up to be the best Superhero film of 2016 to me. One complaint was that this film was more concerned about universe building than telling a great story than Civil War but for me it was the other way around; Civil War felt like a build up to something else and to be honest, I felt that way when I saw the other MCU films. Batman vs Superman however not only had a great story, but it also felt a lot more consistent than Civil War. This film was way more diverse with the cast than the MCU but unlike the MCU, I felt like this film doesn't go overboard with the SJW stuff like the MCU films or The Star Wars Sequel films do. The Visuals were AMAZING, The Score by Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL was AMAZING as well, The Tone is just right as I actually felt for the characters emotionally, The Cinematography kept my eyes glued to the screen, and the script felt really Intelligent and Complex and despite people calling the writing confusing, I was able to piece it together with no problem whatsoever. This film is similar to Empire Strikes back in terms of popularity so over time after the other movies are released, this movie would probably be more popular.This film was way better than I Expected and deserves another chance.

"Its shame to see what critics and marvel fans did to this movie and targeted Zack Snyder for it. I have seen this movie more than 25 times till date. And i enjoy this movie as much as i enjoyed the first time. The fans who have read DC comics, wouldn't be disappointed in this movie. Its dark movie, yes it is. Because the title shows the intense situation at hand. Two superheroes about to rip each other apart for whatever reasons that brought them to this stage. Yes it had to be dark and intense.Only marvel can be stupid enough to show an alien invasion where humans are loosing the battle and the super heroes are cracking jokes while battles as if they are playing ping pong. a person playing Call of Duty game is more serious while playing than the marvel heroes fighting aliens."

"Last week some news came out from somebody online who had claimed to have seen a finished version of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. If you were like me, you've been leery of checking it out because you weren't sure how much might actually be true. Now Zack Snyder has spoken out about the spoiler-filled post, although his response doesn't really clear anything up.In a word, to MTV, he called the post \"hilarious,which might imply that he's saying that it's mostly, if not entirely, untrue. That might be the case, but then again he could have just said it was untrue and he didn't say that. What he did say, however, is that he doesn't like spoilers. While this may seem odd for the director who's most recent trailer appeared to give away the entire movie, Snyder says that's not the case. Even if you've seen the trailer, you can rest easy, as there is much more we have not seen in then finished film. Says Snyder I have the benefit of seeing the movie. It's cool that think it's too much, and I appreciate people not wanting to know, but there's plenty that they don't know. There's a lot of movie that's not in the trailer. In the process of calling the Batman v Superman Reddit review hilarious, Snyder goes on to talk about how he hates it when spoilers come out. The director would much rather that fans see the movie mostly blind. While he understands that some fans may wish to find the answers before hand, he wants his movies to be mysteries going in. If you're, as an audience member, exploring these articles, looking for answers to questions that you have, maybe you're okay with knowing before you go. It's like an individual taste. But like I said, I want people to see the movie without knowing.Spoilers are a topic that mean different things to different people. While most try to avoid them to some degree, the need to solve the mystery is a nearly universal human experience. We have an inclination to want to know the truth, even while also wanting to be surprised. For most of us getting some information is good, but getting all the information is bad, of course, only getting the details that you want can be difficult."
"The theatrical is choppy, poorly edited, hard to follow, with some really good moments mixed in their. The extended is much more fluent and is much easier to follow, it does have a long runtime, which might make it seem a bit dragging on, but if you like long films done right, like Lord of the Rings, you will like this movie as long as you get into the characters and story. Speaking of which, the story starts out perfectly showing Bruce Wayne as a character, and it is very powerful. There are several moments in this movie that are powerful, emotional, and shocking. Characters. Batman is my favorite fictional character of all time, and believe me when I say, Ben Affleck as Batman was perfect, he had the charisma, the anger, and the look of being through some bad stuff Gal Gadot also does perfect as Wonder Woman, but if you want to really see how good she does, go watch the Wonder Woman movie. Henry Call as Superman. I really don't like it when people say Christopher Reeves is better. Don't get me wrong, Reeves does great, but can you imagine him as Superman in this movie? I wouldn't like it. It would be like Adam West playing Batman in The Dark Knight. Henry Cavill does great in this role, I can say everything about him as I said with Ben Affleck. Jesse Eisenberg as Luthor. I thought it was different in a good way. I've heard a criticism for him as being too much like Joker, but is that a bad thing? Joker is my favorite villain, so to see Superman have an enemy that crazy, but still hold the values Luthor needs to be Luthor, I think it is great. The thing I thought this movie was lacking in the first and second acts was humor, at least good humor. If there was more humor, I would've given this movie a ten because it would give a more relaxing feel to the parts that needed it. All in all though, this movie was awesome, it had powerful moments, it was badass, and just plain fun. It had a great story arc and does its job very well."

"*I will be talking about the Ultimate Edition of the film* This was one of the most anticipated CBM of all time. Ever since the arrival and subsequent success of Marvel's The Avengers people have wondered when will DC launch its own cinematic universe, one of the main reasons being the opportunity to finally see titans such as Batman and Superman share the screen together: the ultimate nerd dream. On 2016, the moment finally came for BvS to be released AND.. it performed poorly. Not only did critical reception left a lot to be desired, but fan reactions where surprisingly split after its cinematic debut. People either loved it and called Zack a genius, or hated it and called him a hack. Me, personally, I found myself with middle of the road feelings, for sure, but more leaning towards the negative side with subsequent viewings. The theatrical cut of the film showcased amazing performances, incredible visuals, and action set pieces that seemed like comic book panels come to life, in a good way. However, when it comes to its narrative structure and more technical aspects like editing, the film was seriously flawed. More plot holes than Age of Ultron, questionable character decisions, random editing that lacked cohesion and focus, and forced dramatic moments that lacked any impact because the attempts at character development ranged from limited to nonexistent, especially when it comes to Superman's character. I thought it was a 5/10 movie at best. As such, I was kind of skeptical about the idea of a 30 minute longer version. I say kind of because I know how Zack works. I remember Watchmen being vastly improved with its director's cut, so in a way I was expecting BvS to perform in a similar manner, but I also feared those 30 minutes wold be just there to amplify action and discredit storytelling issues. Oh boy, I'm so glad I was proved wrong. The ultimate cut of the film was infuriating, but not because it was awful, but because it questions the sanity of WB executives and editors and makes you wonder what were they thinking during the editing process. What I got out of the Ultimate Edition was a thought-provoking deconstruction of two very iconic superheroes that gave spotlight to the struggles both of them face when they aren't fighting crime. What I got was an extremely well produced character study on both Batman and Superman in a cynical world, a world dangerously close to our own. We meet Batman as a ruthless, worn out hero that has seen the failure behind his ideals and witnessed some truly horrifying things in his life. Superman, on the other hand, is portrayed as a godlike figure that seeks to do good in the world, but finds himself emotionally conflicted once he realized that every good deed he does leaves behind a trail of destruction (most of it due to Luthor's antics). In my opinion, this is a hugely original approach, one that distances itself from the rest of the competition and delivers a dark, somber, yet relevant superhero movie that understands both characters and gives them real human struggles to deal with. I felt invested in both of them, and hoped that by the end of the film both could find a way to redeem themselves. Their character arcs were very well established during the first two acts of the movie, and by the time we get to the titular climactic battle the emotion behind the jaw-dropping action is intensified. Lex Luthor as a villain was also given more time to develop with this new edition. One of the main criticisms with the original version was the fact that his plan relied too much on conveniences, and the character's mannerisms and mad-scientist attitude was annoying, and that goes without saying his motivations were unclear. Not only do we spend more time understanding his hate for any godlike figure and thus his hatred for Superman, but the added scenes allowed us to witness his entire plan come to fruition. It sells the cold, manipulative, calculating attributes of his comic counterpart. The acting is spot on. Every actor owns his/her role, from Cavill's Superman, to Ben Affleck as Batman, Eisenberg as Luthor, and Gadot as Wonder Woman, whose scenes are brief, but are more than enough to sell the strong and ferocious warrior that she is. Cinematography is stunning, and miles above that of Man of Steel's. And the soundtrack by Zimmer and Junkie XL? Perfect, just perfect. When it comes to flaws, the film still has some of those. The Martha moment, while serving as a pivotal character moment for Batman, felt off in execution, and its understandable that many people got mad at it. If your main complaint about BvS the first time around was its bleak tone and subject matter, this film is still not for you. I understand most were expecting to see the heroes being the most iconic versions of themselves, clashing in an elongated battle and evoking the same feelings The Avengers gave audiences back in 2012. In that sense, the film will remain divisive, but at least I have the comfort of saying that, at the very least, the film is competently made."

"This film was amazing. Ben Affleck was easily the best part of this movie, he brought his a-game as Batman. The chemistry between Affleck & Irons was outstanding. Gal Gadot did a great job as Wonder Woman. The fight between Batman & Superman was awesome. The final fight with Doomsday was outstanding in every way possible. However, there is only one problem with this film and that's Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor. He was sadly missed cast in this role, but then again it's really the fault of Warner Bros. Studios. Overall, this film deliver on almost every level. I highly recommend that you watch the extended version of this film."

"I know I know. I saw it in theaters too, and felt like it could've been so much better. While the Batman element was good, the narrative felt fractured, and the third act was just one long stunt scene. Superman was relegated to a supporting character, and other characters didn't get a chance to shine. And then I chanced on the ultimate cut. Calling it 30 mins of \"extra\" footage is unfair to Zack Snyder because it's exactly these 30 mins that makes the movie a worthy one. What I can say about the theatrical cut is this - It had the blockbuster elements - music, visuals, stunts, CGI. But, it lacked the human elements. The first 20 mins of the movie had it, but not after that. The extended cut in comparison has a flow to the narrative. There are no disjointed scenes, everything flows smoothly, and there's connective tissue. Superman gets to spend some time with his father, and mother. Clark Kent does some investigative journalism. Superman helps the people after the blast. Lois Lane doesn't jump to conclusions, she gets to the bottom of the crime. Lex Luthor apparently had a coherent plan - everything is explained pretty well. Wonder Woman was already good, so there's no change there :) Also, the \"Martha\" scene seems better executed, because it is a few seconds longer, and there's time to breathe it in. So, here's my take on this movie - The theatrical cut was junk. Get the Bluray for ultimate edition, and you shall not be disappointed. I've seen it so many more times now, and it's the definitive cut. It is the movie we deserve. It's a unique take on Batman, and Superman. It's a gritty take on the superhero movie genre, and definitely the best DCEU movie, and the best DC movie since The Dark Knight.P.S. Yes it's dark. We're adults, and we should appreciate mature film making without intentionally silly moments. It attempts to be philosophical, and something deep instead of just trying to make you chuckle."

"This is one of the best superhero movies ever made. Zack Snyder is a magician behind the camera.The reason behind so many complaints is the fact that Warner Bros. marketed this movie as a fight between Batman and Superman. That's not what it is. It's a movie about the origins of the Justice League.The cinematography, the acting and the score are all second to none. This film is phenomenal.P.S: watch the 3 hour extended cut that Snyder intended you to see, not the 2 and a half hour movie that Warner Bros. decided would be better for theaters."

"I don't care what the critics say, this is a very well-done movie. I'll start my review by listing what I like about the movie.1.) Ben Affleck is the best batman to me and it is not close. He pulls off the role of an aging batman extremely well. Also, Zack Snyder's vision of batman is legit. I have always hated batman up until this adaptation of him. Instead of being a conflicted and idealistic batman, this batman is dark, gritty, and 100% a badass. His equipment is decked out with machine guns and he has no aversion to killing people. In fact, he probably kills about 50 criminal by the time this movie is over. The warehouse scene is the coolest batman scene in any movie.2.) The development of a grudge between batman and superman is pulled off flawlessly. It actually makes sense why batman dislikes superman. Then, when they do fight it is about the coolest thing you can expect to see from a superhero film. 3.) I disagree with a lot of people about Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor. In my opinion, he played his role to perfection. 4.) B v S sets up Wonder Woman and Justice League with Gal Gadot's cameo as Wonder Woman and short clips of Aquaman, the Flash, and Cyborg. B v S is one of my favorite superhero films and rewatching it never gets old."

"The theatrical cut of this film is garbage which is why I rated it eight stars instead of nine. The first time I watched this film I didn't like it (not straight out hate but didn't like). Character motivations didn't make any sense, Lex was annoying as s***, editing was sloppy, and it was overly dark and broody for an action superhero movie. A year + a half, five Marvel films, a ton of bad reviews and a Justice League later a thought popped into my head: \"what if I watched BVS again\". This time I didn't have trailers ruining the best moments, I only vaguely remembered the film, and I was conditioned to look at it negatively but something unexpected happened: I actually loved it. Superman was just a normal person that tried to make a difference cause he could that others imposed their own beliefs on. Lex Luthor was a genius that couldn't stand his powerlessness compared to Superman or more accurately a super being. As Alfred said \"The fever, the rage, the feeling of powerlessness that turns good men... cruel\" and you see the same thought process in Batman. Batman, just like Lex Luthor feels powerless in the midst of a god-being and just like Lex he attempts to destroy him so he can get his sense of power back but unlike Lex, Batman learns something. I what is one of the corniest lines of the movie Superman says, \"Martha\" when he knows he can't win against Batman in a late desperate attempt to save his mother. Not only does this name connect with Bruce Wayne but it also shows what really matters to a man of steel: it isn't power, it isn't fame or anything else, it is his Mother and on a broader scale it is people. Lex (who doesn't care about people at all) knows he doesn't have the power so he creates something from his blood and the remains of Zod: A Doomsday for Superman. Not only does this film have depth but it also doesn't always explain it to you which is rare in a blockbuster action superhero flick normally cater to semi-comic book fans and people that want to shove popcorn in their mouths. This film rewards you for really noticing the details while still having massive explosions. One of my favorites is how Lex has all of Batman's branded killed which is why he isn't afraid of the branding at the end or Grandma's Peach Tea as a way of scaring the s*** out of someone. Of course, this film isn't perfect and I do have personal dislikes. The Batman V Superman fight was slow and pretty boring especially after watching such an amazing fight in Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 2 (If you haven't watched the animated Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 1 and 2 you are sorely missing out on something fantastic). Also, the addition of Wonder Woman who pretty much steals a hacker thing, gives it back and then suits up and fights against a giant monster thing. Not to say I don't like Wonder Woman (She is one of my favorite Superheroes of all time who showed not only can woman kick a** but they also don't need to be ashamed of their sexuality or gender) but she wasn't really that helpful to the plot and just brought in to expand the universe which was well done through Lex's superhuman hunting files. Also, the post-apocalyptic scene that was just a dream could have been cut but nothing is perfect except movies like Citizen Kane which isn't a lot of fun to watch cause it is too perfect. So to summarize, the theatrical cut is bad, the ultimate cut is Amazing and the other cut is meh. Please give it a second chance because it deserves it and save a good director from losing grace because of something he didn't do."
"I really liked it, don't know what all the hate is about. I'm actually a Marvel fan from when I was 7 or so, but Superman and Batman together in 1 movie? Just great. And personally I like Ben Affleck even better than Christian Bale as Batman. So just watch and enjoy, I know I did!"

"That's right. We have been waiting for these two heroes to finally meet and fight against each other. This movie is so good in both plot and special effects.Henry Cavill and Ben Affleck have performed well in their acting stages. They are the best superhero actors and they have filmed their fighting scenes very well. The movie starts to show the conflict between the lives of the heroes and now they have blamed each other for it. This movie is amazing and sets up a good plot for Dawn Justice."

"Actually...I didn't know what to expect. When you see Wonder Woman, you know it will be off of Wonder Woman and off of a Wonder Woman story, but with Batman V Superman, I was like, \"hmmmm, so who is this about?\" It was pretty obvious that it would feature many characters, but I thought the introduction to Batman was amazing. Ben Affleck nailed the part, not only as Batman but also as Bruce Wayne. He is my Batman. Henry Cavill continued to be super as the Man of Steel. And he is my Super - Man. A dark story? Yes, without a doubt. Could it have had a few more jokes? Sure. But not all movies or stories need to have jokes when certain events are serious. I really hope people can see this review and take another look at the movie, because, I loved it. I really hope the ratings can go up, eventually. And P.S, this movie is the perfect set up to Justice League."

"I'll start by making it clear I have only ever seen the Ultimate Edition. I'm aware of what was cut out for the theatrical release, so I will concede up front that most of the criticisms about pacing, editing, and missing bits of plot at release were merited.With that caveat out of the way, I must reiterate that this was bar-none the boldest superhero movie I have ever seen. To me, it was arguably the best as well, though \"best\" shouldn't be taken to mean \"most enjoyable.\" That honor easily goes to \"Thor: Ragnarok.\" What makes BvS stand out among other films in the genre is that it takes two characters who have been done to death since the 1970s and brings them up to date. I recently tried to watch \"Superman: The Movie\" for the first time in a number of years, and while it was still good and Reeves will always be iconic, I just couldn't take it seriously. I'll put it this way: If the story in BvS was \"stupid\" in your view but Superman turning back time by spinning the earth backward on its axis didn't seem like one of the dumbest things you have ever seen -in any movie from any genre- to the extent that it outright ruins the movie for you, then your opinion about BvS isn't worth much. Nostalgic bias was always going to be a problem for this movie, and the way people reacted to and reviewed \"Man of Steel\" was telling in this regard.That brings me to Zack Snyder's take on Superman. You know, that guy whose status as the first extraterrestrial ever encountered by humanity was a total non-issue in the old movies. Apparently, Snyder has a similar view to my own in that his take on the Man of Steel makes his being an alien a core piece of his identity. He may look like any other (absurdly attractive) person, but he knows what he is, and that makes him perpetually uncertain of where he fits in this world. He is essentially good and really does care about people, but he struggles to truly empathize with the likes of us. To be human is to be frail, and that is not something he can easily relate to. This is the root of his conflict with Batman.Just as Clark struggles to genuinely relate to most people, Snyder's Batman either refuses to or otherwise just can't relate to Superman. He doesn't see him as anything but a threat regardless of Superman's clear good intentions. Remember, a small group of Kryptonians were able to bring humanity to the brink of extinction in less than a day, and Bruce Wayne is nothing if not a realist. He didn't know the guy from Kansas. He only knew the god from another world.While Batman's anger toward and fear of Superman are readily apparent from the start, Superman's inability to imagine things from Bruce Wayne's perspective only becomes truly apparent during their first real interaction. This reminded me of the animated version of the \"world's finest\" storyline, where Superman judges Batman harshly for using fear tactics and threats of violence (also, actual violence) to get the job done. Superman wasn't willing to consider what it would take for a human man to fight criminals and save innocents, or what that life would do to him over time. Just as Batman didn't see the guy from Kansas, Superman didn't see the man who lives his life trapped in one brutal, unthinkably traumatic moment (this was beautifully conveyed during the film's opening moments), and had spent his whole adult life bearing witness to humanity at its absolute worst.The conflict between these two characters is as old as human history. They want the same things, but they can't understand one another. So they fight. And what a fight it was.Watching a fight between, say, Captain America and Iron Man was, to me, more frustrating than anything because each understood the other's perspective perfectly. The fight between Batman and Superman in BvS was genuinely gut-wrenching, as intended, because they would have understood one another if either had tried. The whole sequence hilighted Batman's tactical prowess and ability to control a situation. Maybe the most badass thing about the fight was that it ended exactly where Batman planned. That brings me to the big elephant in the room named \"Martha.\"I can't recall exactly which YouTuber put it this way, but if you thought the \"save Martha\" exchange was about their mothers having the same name, you had your brain turned off. The brain-on people have explained this to death, but it bears repeating. This was the moment when Superman became humanized to Batman. He was about to die, and his only concern was for his adoptive human mother. He still believed that the man about to take his life would do the right thing. Even with the cowl on, there was no mistaking the look on Batman's face. It was the look of shame, guilt, and sudden uncertainty that says \"What am I doing?\" Turns out even the most brutal, angry version of Bruce Wayne is better than Tony Stark at knowing right from wrong. At knowing that he had gone too far.From there, the third act was a series of truly impressive (albeit mostly CGI) fight sequences, beginning with what I regard as the undisputed champion of Batman fights. Nothing in the Nolan movies (and especially nothing in the Burton movies) even came close. Go ahead, try to convince yourself that Batman and Bane taking turns punching one another in the face until Bane's mask broke was a good fight sequence. No, this was a fight straight out of \"Arkham Knight,\" and it was glorious. The battle against Doomsday really was one for the books. From the moment Wonder Woman arrived accompanied by the intense sounds of Tina Guo's electric cello to Superman's tragic, heroic death at the hands of Doomsday, I was glued to the screen. Sure, the mere presence of Doomsday spoiled the end to a degree, but watching the Man of Steel laboring to carry that kryptonite spear towards certain death was no less impactful. A brief word on Jesse Eisenberg's take on Lex Luthor. At least one other reviewer on this site already said it best when they pointed out that this was his origin story. If you consider his scheme objectively, he is actually one of the more formidable incarnations of the character. If we're lucky, we'll eventually get to see a Snyder Cut of \"Justice League\" and find out where this story was actually meant to go. For the record, Joss Whedon and Danny Elfman both should have said \"no\" to taking a dump on someone else's art."
"BATMAN V SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE brings a fantastic surprise to a smash-hit team-up with one of the worlds most beloved DC Comics' icons of all time. The movie delivers spectacular casting, and fantastic acting with different characters having their shine in each scenes.The story follows Clark Kent/Superman who becomes a threat, after the destruction in Metropolis in Man Of Steel.(2013). Batman/Bruce Wayne sees him as a threat and begins his war on Superman.The movie brings spectacular storytelling, it tells the complications of human against alien who are on the same side, and the first meeting of Batman and Superman. The story of Bruce Wayne, with his many years of The Caped Crusader, sends him on a spiral of \"out of control\", sheer anger, and builds tension to wanting to defeat the Man of Steel. Snyder has fantastically gave this storytelling an exciting nod to the comics.Lex Luthor, played by Jesse Einsberg, delivers a very interesting performance, but very differently by him showing is his \"origin\" before he becomes a bald foe to the Man of Steel. He shows that his love of \"god vs man\" terrorises mankind when he ultimately creates Doomsday, and Batman realises Superman's inner heroism.It packs so many great \"out of nowhere\" excitement, including a first-look of the fearful Wonder Woman a.k.a. Diana Prince, played by Gal Gadot, and a fresh-new glimpse of the superhero DC canon: The Justice League.WATCH THIS MOVIE! The critics are out of their mind. It's a fun-packed action adventure which still keeps the movie enjoyable until it's final minutes of the movie. It's a FANTASTIC MOVIE! BEN AFFLECK AS BATMAN... is Incredible!A 10/10 overall!"
"I want to go on record as saying that this is a truly thrilling cinematic experience in so many ways. If pressed, I guess I could acknowledge that there were a couple ... let's say \"clumsy\" moments. And in a film that runs to three hours, that hardly seems like a significant issue, certainly not enough to rate it with fewer than 9 stars.This film has everything. There is dramatic tension right from the start. There is a magnificent story arc that picks up quite seamlessly from 'Man of Steel' and propels the viewer not only into the life of Clark Kent/Superman but also of Bruce Wayne/Batman.The villain is no mere cartoon of a villain; he is truly thoroughly (and apparently irrevocably) diabolical. He is a psychopath, and you wish for his death over and over and over. You want Superman to reduce him to ash with the power of his eyes.I have read a number of viewers' reviews, and it seems that the people who disliked the film / gave it a low rating had rather unfair and unrealistic expectations of it. That is, their own prejudices about how the plot could/should unfold or what the character development could/should be, etc. ruined the film for them. And that is a shame.My thought is: I settle into my seat, wait for the lights to dim, and then I wait to be transported by the film. I accept it, lock, stock, and barrel.As another reviewer remarked, I love how the film begins from the point of view of Bruce Wayne as he is among people on the ground who have fallen victim to the attack of Zod and the other Kryptonians.Why would Bruce Wayne not like Superman? Why would the good people of Earth hurl insults at Superman and burn him in effigy (on the news)? Because the good people of Earth just got catapulted into a new reality in which there are not only extraterrestrial beings (surprise!) but they are also superman! And a group of them are hell-bent on destroying humankind and taking the planet for themselves.It is difficult to see Superman as separate from the whole Kryptonian Krew.It seems that many moviegoers forgot that Bruce Wayne is also human. Sure, he's a hero, but he is flawed.. Just like the rest of us. He is a vigilante, after all.He has let his vigilantism get the better of him. HE is actually the one working outside the boundaries of the law, not Superman. It is the clear head of Alfred that shows us that he has gone into a rather dark place, that he has not seen what is really going on (in Luthor's scheme), and so he chooses to embark on his own scheme scheme to take out the alien invader. He is (allegedly) thinking of the future: if he wipes out the all-powerful alien, then it can't turn on humankind in the future. At least, he convinces himself of that.A philosophical question is raised in the film: should Clark Kent have remained a simple man from Kansas and never have become the Superman? Should he just let people die and let calamities happen? The question is answered for us in the character of Diana Prince/Wonder Woman. She withdrew from mankind (her exact words) and just sat around watching. Watching while people died horrible deaths all around her. So, should Superman have done the same? Do these special beings, these 'metahumans', have some kind of moral imperative to intervene, or should they be allowed to be regular people, too? It seems that humans want it both ways.It seems that humans are saying: \"Don't be a superalien ... except when I and my friends and family are in trouble. Then come save us.\""

"Batman v Superman: Ultimate Edition: If your looking for a quick, cheap thrill then you might not enjoy this film at the time. This movies theatrical version was butchered by WB and in doing so reshaped the story leaving numerous plot holes. So the Ultimate Edition is the full story and the one worth seeing. Watch 'Man of Steel' before seeing this movie. There is much to claw through here, so much so that the audience might easily find themselves exhausted from the overall aggression of the film. However, a lot of the story does work. The action is good, and the emotion feels real most of the time.This film is about Superman trying to become Superman. Trying to help the world, save people, find a place in this world not as an outcast, and yet is looked at has a threat by many. Superman is not from this world, yet He is trying to be human, find a place in this world, be excepted by earths people, and come into his destiny.This film is also about Batman being Batman for 20 years and losing faith in humanity, and fearing Superman, what Superman can do with his powers. Great film, great plot, great visuals. ---Yidioo"
"I didn't see the film in the theaters and just bought the \"Extended Edition \" on Amazon. I never properly saw Man of Steel- i think I rented it and watched it when already exhausted and fell asleep. I saw the mediocre user reviews and horrible reviews from critics of this film.They really have it wrong. This is the very best either Batman or Superman. It has a different take, on things. Much darker then earlier films even darker then the Christopher Nolan Batman films.First of all Christopher Nolan is an Executive Producer. So how bad could it be? I loved Sucker Punch and Zack Snyder was involved with that. So how bad could this be? Hans Zimmer did the music, so how bad could it be?I remember watching the old Superman TV shows and reading the Superman and Batman comics as a little kid and loved them, but i wouldn't call myself a \"fan boy\" of comic universes, like so many younger people today. As an older adult I will admit my favorite TV show of all time was Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but watched it on DVD only after it had finished. I saw the second of the Dark Knight series in the theater, but the other two, I watched on DVD. They were great, but not my favorite films like so many people. i also loved the first couple Superman and Batman films in the older series. Regardless, i was not waiting with baited breath to see Man of Steel or this one.I'm more of a serious film fan, who can watch Stanley Kubrick films over and over and my favorite films in the last twenty years, are Eyes Wide Shut and Intersteller, both of which i've watched multiple times.So, with that said, take it from me, the critics have this film very wrong, just as critics hated 2001: A Space Odyssey when it first came out. This film will have lasting appreciation.Surprised how much I liked Ben Afleck's Batman. it was hard to get into Henry Cavil's scrawnier looking Superman, but it grew on me. Amy Adams was great as Lois Lane, The Gal Gadol Wonder Women was amazing. Lex Luther was terrific, like Nolan's Joker. Jeremy Irons was the best Alfred ever. Holly Hunter and Diane Lane was good too. The movie had bad reviews but made a billion dollars. Hopefully everyone buys the Ultimate Edition and it breaks sales records and the film is re-appreciated. I have no idea what scenes this Ultimate Edition added, but it is pretty perfect. Now I can't wait for Wonder Woman and the Justice League and as soon as I finish writing this am going to watch Man of Steal. I'm into it now!I can only surmise that the bad reviews stem from too much expectations of the rigid fan boy types and the radical changes in tone, we see in this film.Total masterpiece of cinema, but I have a few criticisms. There are a few hollow scenes of typical Idiot cops and authorities getting everything wrong in a cliché type way and it has a few filler scenes of that type and a few moments here and there that felt rushed and cheesy. Maybe not everything restored into the Ultimate Edition should have been. I wish there had been more Kevin Costner scenes."

"The whole entire Batman V Superman movie was great and yes even though it felt slow to the majority of the people who watched it but to me I enjoyed every part and every scene of Batman V Superman and when it got to the fight scenes both batman VS Superman and the Doomsday fight it brought so much drama, intensity, and epic performances. So with that being said I give this movie a good 10/10 because it really did go to my expectations and it brought a powerful performance and a powerful yet epic introduction to the upcoming Justice League."

"When I first wrote a review for this movie a year ago exclaiming my excitement for the film, I had been high off a fresh dose of live-action DC superheroes playing out the beloved comic book stories that I had grown up on. It was all playing out before my eyes and coming to life. After a few months had passed, I began to notice things about the movie that I disliked: little gaps in the story, things that didn't add up, etc. My original rating of a 10 / 10 dropped to an 8 /10. But today it has gone back up to a 10. The extended version of the film not only rectifies the gaps but also silences critics.Many claimed that the movie was too dark or that it just didn't make sense. To those people, I say: \"Pick up a comic book!\" Many of the critics of this particular film were part of the superhero bandwagon that formed when Marvel began its spree of Avengers-related films. In fact, its estimated that over 60% of people who go to see 'superhero' genre films have never picked up a comic book in their life. I would argue that similar numbers could figure to those which view the CW televised DC Universe shows. People complain that DC comics is just too dark but the fact is that these movies are based upon actual comics which are meant to be dark (ex: The Dark Knight Returns, Injustice, etc.). Its like complaining that Game of Thrones (the TV series) sucks because they kill off too many characters. Read the books! Its frustrating to see such a beautiful work of art like Batman V Superman criticized by those ignorant to its universe and its meaning. This movie is in fact a catalyst that opens numerous doorways and leaves true fans in awe of the possibilities for future movies. But regardless of whether or not people choose to educate themselves, this film's DVD/Blu-ray extended version puts the theater release to shame. All of the plot holes and gaps are filled in 30 minutes of extended footage scattered throughout the film. The movie ultimately becomes more complete and people will wish that the movie had shown the full 3 hours of footage in its theatrical debut. As a major DC comics fan, I will of course pick up on things that a comics fan would not, but someone who does not read comics would learn to appreciate this film in its entirety with the extended version. Get your hands on a copy today or find it on Netflix or the internet somewhere!"

"I ignored the bad reviews and watched anyways. This film had a lot to live up to after Civil War was released and I went into this film expecting the worst. It ended up to be the best Superhero film of 2016 to me. One complaint was that this film was more concerned about universe building than telling a great story than Civil War but for me it was the other way around; Civil War felt like a build up to something else and to be honest, I felt that way when I saw the other MCU films. Batman vs Superman however not only had a great story, but it also felt a lot more consistent than Civil War. This film was way more diverse with the cast than the MCU but unlike the MCU, I felt like this film doesn't go overboard with the SJW stuff like the MCU films or The Star Wars Sequel films do. The Visuals were AMAZING, The Score by Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL was AMAZING as well, The Tone is just right as I actually felt for the characters emotionally, The Cinematography kept my eyes glued to the screen, and the script felt really Intelligent and Complex and despite people calling the writing confusing, I was able to piece it together with no problem whatsoever. This film is similar to Empire Strikes back in terms of popularity so over time after the other movies are released, this movie would probably be more popular.This film was way better than I Expected and deserves another chance.

"Its shame to see what critics and marvel fans did to this movie and targeted Zack Snyder for it. I have seen this movie more than 25 times till date. And i enjoy this movie as much as i enjoyed the first time. The fans who have read DC comics, wouldn't be disappointed in this movie. Its dark movie, yes it is. Because the title shows the intense situation at hand. Two superheroes about to rip each other apart for whatever reasons that brought them to this stage. Yes it had to be dark and intense.Only marvel can be stupid enough to show an alien invasion where humans are loosing the battle and the super heroes are cracking jokes while battles as if they are playing ping pong. a person playing Call of Duty game is more serious while playing than the marvel heroes fighting aliens."

"Last week some news came out from somebody online who had claimed to have seen a finished version of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. If you were like me, you've been leery of checking it out because you weren't sure how much might actually be true. Now Zack Snyder has spoken out about the spoiler-filled post, although his response doesn't really clear anything up.In a word, to MTV, he called the post \"hilarious,which might imply that he's saying that it's mostly, if not entirely, untrue. That might be the case, but then again he could have just said it was untrue and he didn't say that. What he did say, however, is that he doesn't like spoilers. While this may seem odd for the director who's most recent trailer appeared to give away the entire movie, Snyder says that's not the case. Even if you've seen the trailer, you can rest easy, as there is much more we have not seen in then finished film. Says Snyder I have the benefit of seeing the movie. It's cool that think it's too much, and I appreciate people not wanting to know, but there's plenty that they don't know. There's a lot of movie that's not in the trailer. In the process of calling the Batman v Superman Reddit review hilarious, Snyder goes on to talk about how he hates it when spoilers come out. The director would much rather that fans see the movie mostly blind. While he understands that some fans may wish to find the answers before hand, he wants his movies to be mysteries going in. If you're, as an audience member, exploring these articles, looking for answers to questions that you have, maybe you're okay with knowing before you go. It's like an individual taste. But like I said, I want people to see the movie without knowing.Spoilers are a topic that mean different things to different people. While most try to avoid them to some degree, the need to solve the mystery is a nearly universal human experience. We have an inclination to want to know the truth, even while also wanting to be surprised. For most of us getting some information is good, but getting all the information is bad, of course, only getting the details that you want can be difficult."
"The theatrical is choppy, poorly edited, hard to follow, with some really good moments mixed in their. The extended is much more fluent and is much easier to follow, it does have a long runtime, which might make it seem a bit dragging on, but if you like long films done right, like Lord of the Rings, you will like this movie as long as you get into the characters and story. Speaking of which, the story starts out perfectly showing Bruce Wayne as a character, and it is very powerful. There are several moments in this movie that are powerful, emotional, and shocking. Characters. Batman is my favorite fictional character of all time, and believe me when I say, Ben Affleck as Batman was perfect, he had the charisma, the anger, and the look of being through some bad stuff Gal Gadot also does perfect as Wonder Woman, but if you want to really see how good she does, go watch the Wonder Woman movie. Henry Call as Superman. I really don't like it when people say Christopher Reeves is better. Don't get me wrong, Reeves does great, but can you imagine him as Superman in this movie? I wouldn't like it. It would be like Adam West playing Batman in The Dark Knight. Henry Cavill does great in this role, I can say everything about him as I said with Ben Affleck. Jesse Eisenberg as Luthor. I thought it was different in a good way. I've heard a criticism for him as being too much like Joker, but is that a bad thing? Joker is my favorite villain, so to see Superman have an enemy that crazy, but still hold the values Luthor needs to be Luthor, I think it is great. The thing I thought this movie was lacking in the first and second acts was humor, at least good humor. If there was more humor, I would've given this movie a ten because it would give a more relaxing feel to the parts that needed it. All in all though, this movie was awesome, it had powerful moments, it was badass, and just plain fun. It had a great story arc and does its job very well."

"*I will be talking about the Ultimate Edition of the film* This was one of the most anticipated CBM of all time. Ever since the arrival and subsequent success of Marvel's The Avengers people have wondered when will DC launch its own cinematic universe, one of the main reasons being the opportunity to finally see titans such as Batman and Superman share the screen together: the ultimate nerd dream. On 2016, the moment finally came for BvS to be released AND.. it performed poorly. Not only did critical reception left a lot to be desired, but fan reactions where surprisingly split after its cinematic debut. People either loved it and called Zack a genius, or hated it and called him a hack. Me, personally, I found myself with middle of the road feelings, for sure, but more leaning towards the negative side with subsequent viewings. The theatrical cut of the film showcased amazing performances, incredible visuals, and action set pieces that seemed like comic book panels come to life, in a good way. However, when it comes to its narrative structure and more technical aspects like editing, the film was seriously flawed. More plot holes than Age of Ultron, questionable character decisions, random editing that lacked cohesion and focus, and forced dramatic moments that lacked any impact because the attempts at character development ranged from limited to nonexistent, especially when it comes to Superman's character. I thought it was a 5/10 movie at best. As such, I was kind of skeptical about the idea of a 30 minute longer version. I say kind of because I know how Zack works. I remember Watchmen being vastly improved with its director's cut, so in a way I was expecting BvS to perform in a similar manner, but I also feared those 30 minutes wold be just there to amplify action and discredit storytelling issues. Oh boy, I'm so glad I was proved wrong. The ultimate cut of the film was infuriating, but not because it was awful, but because it questions the sanity of WB executives and editors and makes you wonder what were they thinking during the editing process. What I got out of the Ultimate Edition was a thought-provoking deconstruction of two very iconic superheroes that gave spotlight to the struggles both of them face when they aren't fighting crime. What I got was an extremely well produced character study on both Batman and Superman in a cynical world, a world dangerously close to our own. We meet Batman as a ruthless, worn out hero that has seen the failure behind his ideals and witnessed some truly horrifying things in his life. Superman, on the other hand, is portrayed as a godlike figure that seeks to do good in the world, but finds himself emotionally conflicted once he realized that every good deed he does leaves behind a trail of destruction (most of it due to Luthor's antics). In my opinion, this is a hugely original approach, one that distances itself from the rest of the competition and delivers a dark, somber, yet relevant superhero movie that understands both characters and gives them real human struggles to deal with. I felt invested in both of them, and hoped that by the end of the film both could find a way to redeem themselves. Their character arcs were very well established during the first two acts of the movie, and by the time we get to the titular climactic battle the emotion behind the jaw-dropping action is intensified. Lex Luthor as a villain was also given more time to develop with this new edition. One of the main criticisms with the original version was the fact that his plan relied too much on conveniences, and the character's mannerisms and mad-scientist attitude was annoying, and that goes without saying his motivations were unclear. Not only do we spend more time understanding his hate for any godlike figure and thus his hatred for Superman, but the added scenes allowed us to witness his entire plan come to fruition. It sells the cold, manipulative, calculating attributes of his comic counterpart. The acting is spot on. Every actor owns his/her role, from Cavill's Superman, to Ben Affleck as Batman, Eisenberg as Luthor, and Gadot as Wonder Woman, whose scenes are brief, but are more than enough to sell the strong and ferocious warrior that she is. Cinematography is stunning, and miles above that of Man of Steel's. And the soundtrack by Zimmer and Junkie XL? Perfect, just perfect. When it comes to flaws, the film still has some of those. The Martha moment, while serving as a pivotal character moment for Batman, felt off in execution, and its understandable that many people got mad at it. If your main complaint about BvS the first time around was its bleak tone and subject matter, this film is still not for you. I understand most were expecting to see the heroes being the most iconic versions of themselves, clashing in an elongated battle and evoking the same feelings The Avengers gave audiences back in 2012. In that sense, the film will remain divisive, but at least I have the comfort of saying that, at the very least, the film is competently made."

"This film was amazing. Ben Affleck was easily the best part of this movie, he brought his a-game as Batman. The chemistry between Affleck & Irons was outstanding. Gal Gadot did a great job as Wonder Woman. The fight between Batman & Superman was awesome. The final fight with Doomsday was outstanding in every way possible. However, there is only one problem with this film and that's Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor. He was sadly missed cast in this role, but then again it's really the fault of Warner Bros. Studios. Overall, this film deliver on almost every level. I highly recommend that you watch the extended version of this film."

"I know I know. I saw it in theaters too, and felt like it could've been so much better. While the Batman element was good, the narrative felt fractured, and the third act was just one long stunt scene. Superman was relegated to a supporting character, and other characters didn't get a chance to shine. And then I chanced on the ultimate cut. Calling it 30 mins of \"extra\" footage is unfair to Zack Snyder because it's exactly these 30 mins that makes the movie a worthy one. What I can say about the theatrical cut is this - It had the blockbuster elements - music, visuals, stunts, CGI. But, it lacked the human elements. The first 20 mins of the movie had it, but not after that. The extended cut in comparison has a flow to the narrative. There are no disjointed scenes, everything flows smoothly, and there's connective tissue. Superman gets to spend some time with his father, and mother. Clark Kent does some investigative journalism. Superman helps the people after the blast. Lois Lane doesn't jump to conclusions, she gets to the bottom of the crime. Lex Luthor apparently had a coherent plan - everything is explained pretty well. Wonder Woman was already good, so there's no change there :) Also, the \"Martha\" scene seems better executed, because it is a few seconds longer, and there's time to breathe it in. So, here's my take on this movie - The theatrical cut was junk. Get the Bluray for ultimate edition, and you shall not be disappointed. I've seen it so many more times now, and it's the definitive cut. It is the movie we deserve. It's a unique take on Batman, and Superman. It's a gritty take on the superhero movie genre, and definitely the best DCEU movie, and the best DC movie since The Dark Knight.P.S. Yes it's dark. We're adults, and we should appreciate mature film making without intentionally silly moments. It attempts to be philosophical, and something deep instead of just trying to make you chuckle."

"This is one of the best superhero movies ever made. Zack Snyder is a magician behind the camera.The reason behind so many complaints is the fact that Warner Bros. marketed this movie as a fight between Batman and Superman. That's not what it is. It's a movie about the origins of the Justice League.The cinematography, the acting and the score are all second to none. This film is phenomenal.P.S: watch the 3 hour extended cut that Snyder intended you to see, not the 2 and a half hour movie that Warner Bros. decided would be better for theaters."

"I don't care what the critics say, this is a very well-done movie. I'll start my review by listing what I like about the movie.1.) Ben Affleck is the best batman to me and it is not close. He pulls off the role of an aging batman extremely well. Also, Zack Snyder's vision of batman is legit. I have always hated batman up until this adaptation of him. Instead of being a conflicted and idealistic batman, this batman is dark, gritty, and 100% a badass. His equipment is decked out with machine guns and he has no aversion to killing people. In fact, he probably kills about 50 criminal by the time this movie is over. The warehouse scene is the coolest batman scene in any movie.2.) The development of a grudge between batman and superman is pulled off flawlessly. It actually makes sense why batman dislikes superman. Then, when they do fight it is about the coolest thing you can expect to see from a superhero film. 3.) I disagree with a lot of people about Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor. In my opinion, he played his role to perfection. 4.) B v S sets up Wonder Woman and Justice League with Gal Gadot's cameo as Wonder Woman and short clips of Aquaman, the Flash, and Cyborg. B v S is one of my favorite superhero films and rewatching it never gets old."

"The theatrical cut of this film is garbage which is why I rated it eight stars instead of nine. The first time I watched this film I didn't like it (not straight out hate but didn't like). Character motivations didn't make any sense, Lex was annoying as s***, editing was sloppy, and it was overly dark and broody for an action superhero movie. A year + a half, five Marvel films, a ton of bad reviews and a Justice League later a thought popped into my head: \"what if I watched BVS again\". This time I didn't have trailers ruining the best moments, I only vaguely remembered the film, and I was conditioned to look at it negatively but something unexpected happened: I actually loved it. Superman was just a normal person that tried to make a difference cause he could that others imposed their own beliefs on. Lex Luthor was a genius that couldn't stand his powerlessness compared to Superman or more accurately a super being. As Alfred said \"The fever, the rage, the feeling of powerlessness that turns good men... cruel\" and you see the same thought process in Batman. Batman, just like Lex Luthor feels powerless in the midst of a god-being and just like Lex he attempts to destroy him so he can get his sense of power back but unlike Lex, Batman learns something. I what is one of the corniest lines of the movie Superman says, \"Martha\" when he knows he can't win against Batman in a late desperate attempt to save his mother. Not only does this name connect with Bruce Wayne but it also shows what really matters to a man of steel: it isn't power, it isn't fame or anything else, it is his Mother and on a broader scale it is people. Lex (who doesn't care about people at all) knows he doesn't have the power so he creates something from his blood and the remains of Zod: A Doomsday for Superman. Not only does this film have depth but it also doesn't always explain it to you which is rare in a blockbuster action superhero flick normally cater to semi-comic book fans and people that want to shove popcorn in their mouths. This film rewards you for really noticing the details while still having massive explosions. One of my favorites is how Lex has all of Batman's branded killed which is why he isn't afraid of the branding at the end or Grandma's Peach Tea as a way of scaring the s*** out of someone. Of course, this film isn't perfect and I do have personal dislikes. The Batman V Superman fight was slow and pretty boring especially after watching such an amazing fight in Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 2 (If you haven't watched the animated Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 1 and 2 you are sorely missing out on something fantastic). Also, the addition of Wonder Woman who pretty much steals a hacker thing, gives it back and then suits up and fights against a giant monster thing. Not to say I don't like Wonder Woman (She is one of my favorite Superheroes of all time who showed not only can woman kick a** but they also don't need to be ashamed of their sexuality or gender) but she wasn't really that helpful to the plot and just brought in to expand the universe which was well done through Lex's superhuman hunting files. Also, the post-apocalyptic scene that was just a dream could have been cut but nothing is perfect except movies like Citizen Kane which isn't a lot of fun to watch cause it is too perfect. So to summarize, the theatrical cut is bad, the ultimate cut is Amazing and the other cut is meh. Please give it a second chance because it deserves it and save a good director from losing grace because of something he didn't do."
"I really liked it, don't know what all the hate is about. I'm actually a Marvel fan from when I was 7 or so, but Superman and Batman together in 1 movie? Just great. And personally I like Ben Affleck even better than Christian Bale as Batman. So just watch and enjoy, I know I did!"

"That's right. We have been waiting for these two heroes to finally meet and fight against each other. This movie is so good in both plot and special effects.Henry Cavill and Ben Affleck have performed well in their acting stages. They are the best superhero actors and they have filmed their fighting scenes very well. The movie starts to show the conflict between the lives of the heroes and now they have blamed each other for it. This movie is amazing and sets up a good plot for Dawn Justice."

"Actually...I didn't know what to expect. When you see Wonder Woman, you know it will be off of Wonder Woman and off of a Wonder Woman story, but with Batman V Superman, I was like, \"hmmmm, so who is this about?\" It was pretty obvious that it would feature many characters, but I thought the introduction to Batman was amazing. Ben Affleck nailed the part, not only as Batman but also as Bruce Wayne. He is my Batman. Henry Cavill continued to be super as the Man of Steel. And he is my Super - Man. A dark story? Yes, without a doubt. Could it have had a few more jokes? Sure. But not all movies or stories need to have jokes when certain events are serious. I really hope people can see this review and take another look at the movie, because, I loved it. I really hope the ratings can go up, eventually. And P.S, this movie is the perfect set up to Justice League."

"I'll start by making it clear I have only ever seen the Ultimate Edition. I'm aware of what was cut out for the theatrical release, so I will concede up front that most of the criticisms about pacing, editing, and missing bits of plot at release were merited.With that caveat out of the way, I must reiterate that this was bar-none the boldest superhero movie I have ever seen. To me, it was arguably the best as well, though \"best\" shouldn't be taken to mean \"most enjoyable.\" That honor easily goes to \"Thor: Ragnarok.\" What makes BvS stand out among other films in the genre is that it takes two characters who have been done to death since the 1970s and brings them up to date. I recently tried to watch \"Superman: The Movie\" for the first time in a number of years, and while it was still good and Reeves will always be iconic, I just couldn't take it seriously. I'll put it this way: If the story in BvS was \"stupid\" in your view but Superman turning back time by spinning the earth backward on its axis didn't seem like one of the dumbest things you have ever seen -in any movie from any genre- to the extent that it outright ruins the movie for you, then your opinion about BvS isn't worth much. Nostalgic bias was always going to be a problem for this movie, and the way people reacted to and reviewed \"Man of Steel\" was telling in this regard.That brings me to Zack Snyder's take on Superman. You know, that guy whose status as the first extraterrestrial ever encountered by humanity was a total non-issue in the old movies. Apparently, Snyder has a similar view to my own in that his take on the Man of Steel makes his being an alien a core piece of his identity. He may look like any other (absurdly attractive) person, but he knows what he is, and that makes him perpetually uncertain of where he fits in this world. He is essentially good and really does care about people, but he struggles to truly empathize with the likes of us. To be human is to be frail, and that is not something he can easily relate to. This is the root of his conflict with Batman.Just as Clark struggles to genuinely relate to most people, Snyder's Batman either refuses to or otherwise just can't relate to Superman. He doesn't see him as anything but a threat regardless of Superman's clear good intentions. Remember, a small group of Kryptonians were able to bring humanity to the brink of extinction in less than a day, and Bruce Wayne is nothing if not a realist. He didn't know the guy from Kansas. He only knew the god from another world.While Batman's anger toward and fear of Superman are readily apparent from the start, Superman's inability to imagine things from Bruce Wayne's perspective only becomes truly apparent during their first real interaction. This reminded me of the animated version of the \"world's finest\" storyline, where Superman judges Batman harshly for using fear tactics and threats of violence (also, actual violence) to get the job done. Superman wasn't willing to consider what it would take for a human man to fight criminals and save innocents, or what that life would do to him over time. Just as Batman didn't see the guy from Kansas, Superman didn't see the man who lives his life trapped in one brutal, unthinkably traumatic moment (this was beautifully conveyed during the film's opening moments), and had spent his whole adult life bearing witness to humanity at its absolute worst.The conflict between these two characters is as old as human history. They want the same things, but they can't understand one another. So they fight. And what a fight it was.Watching a fight between, say, Captain America and Iron Man was, to me, more frustrating than anything because each understood the other's perspective perfectly. The fight between Batman and Superman in BvS was genuinely gut-wrenching, as intended, because they would have understood one another if either had tried. The whole sequence hilighted Batman's tactical prowess and ability to control a situation. Maybe the most badass thing about the fight was that it ended exactly where Batman planned. That brings me to the big elephant in the room named \"Martha.\"I can't recall exactly which YouTuber put it this way, but if you thought the \"save Martha\" exchange was about their mothers having the same name, you had your brain turned off. The brain-on people have explained this to death, but it bears repeating. This was the moment when Superman became humanized to Batman. He was about to die, and his only concern was for his adoptive human mother. He still believed that the man about to take his life would do the right thing. Even with the cowl on, there was no mistaking the look on Batman's face. It was the look of shame, guilt, and sudden uncertainty that says \"What am I doing?\" Turns out even the most brutal, angry version of Bruce Wayne is better than Tony Stark at knowing right from wrong. At knowing that he had gone too far.From there, the third act was a series of truly impressive (albeit mostly CGI) fight sequences, beginning with what I regard as the undisputed champion of Batman fights. Nothing in the Nolan movies (and especially nothing in the Burton movies) even came close. Go ahead, try to convince yourself that Batman and Bane taking turns punching one another in the face until Bane's mask broke was a good fight sequence. No, this was a fight straight out of \"Arkham Knight,\" and it was glorious. The battle against Doomsday really was one for the books. From the moment Wonder Woman arrived accompanied by the intense sounds of Tina Guo's electric cello to Superman's tragic, heroic death at the hands of Doomsday, I was glued to the screen. Sure, the mere presence of Doomsday spoiled the end to a degree, but watching the Man of Steel laboring to carry that kryptonite spear towards certain death was no less impactful. A brief word on Jesse Eisenberg's take on Lex Luthor. At least one other reviewer on this site already said it best when they pointed out that this was his origin story. If you consider his scheme objectively, he is actually one of the more formidable incarnations of the character. If we're lucky, we'll eventually get to see a Snyder Cut of \"Justice League\" and find out where this story was actually meant to go. For the record, Joss Whedon and Danny Elfman both should have said \"no\" to taking a dump on someone else's art."
"BATMAN V SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE brings a fantastic surprise to a smash-hit team-up with one of the worlds most beloved DC Comics' icons of all time. The movie delivers spectacular casting, and fantastic acting with different characters having their shine in each scenes.The story follows Clark Kent/Superman who becomes a threat, after the destruction in Metropolis in Man Of Steel.(2013). Batman/Bruce Wayne sees him as a threat and begins his war on Superman.The movie brings spectacular storytelling, it tells the complications of human against alien who are on the same side, and the first meeting of Batman and Superman. The story of Bruce Wayne, with his many years of The Caped Crusader, sends him on a spiral of \"out of control\", sheer anger, and builds tension to wanting to defeat the Man of Steel. Snyder has fantastically gave this storytelling an exciting nod to the comics.Lex Luthor, played by Jesse Einsberg, delivers a very interesting performance, but very differently by him showing is his \"origin\" before he becomes a bald foe to the Man of Steel. He shows that his love of \"god vs man\" terrorises mankind when he ultimately creates Doomsday, and Batman realises Superman's inner heroism.It packs so many great \"out of nowhere\" excitement, including a first-look of the fearful Wonder Woman a.k.a. Diana Prince, played by Gal Gadot, and a fresh-new glimpse of the superhero DC canon: The Justice League.WATCH THIS MOVIE! The critics are out of their mind. It's a fun-packed action adventure which still keeps the movie enjoyable until it's final minutes of the movie. It's a FANTASTIC MOVIE! BEN AFFLECK AS BATMAN... is Incredible!A 10/10 overall!"
"I want to go on record as saying that this is a truly thrilling cinematic experience in so many ways. If pressed, I guess I could acknowledge that there were a couple ... let's say \"clumsy\" moments. And in a film that runs to three hours, that hardly seems like a significant issue, certainly not enough to rate it with fewer than 9 stars.This film has everything. There is dramatic tension right from the start. There is a magnificent story arc that picks up quite seamlessly from 'Man of Steel' and propels the viewer not only into the life of Clark Kent/Superman but also of Bruce Wayne/Batman.The villain is no mere cartoon of a villain; he is truly thoroughly (and apparently irrevocably) diabolical. He is a psychopath, and you wish for his death over and over and over. You want Superman to reduce him to ash with the power of his eyes.I have read a number of viewers' reviews, and it seems that the people who disliked the film / gave it a low rating had rather unfair and unrealistic expectations of it. That is, their own prejudices about how the plot could/should unfold or what the character development could/should be, etc. ruined the film for them. And that is a shame.My thought is: I settle into my seat, wait for the lights to dim, and then I wait to be transported by the film. I accept it, lock, stock, and barrel.As another reviewer remarked, I love how the film begins from the point of view of Bruce Wayne as he is among people on the ground who have fallen victim to the attack of Zod and the other Kryptonians.Why would Bruce Wayne not like Superman? Why would the good people of Earth hurl insults at Superman and burn him in effigy (on the news)? Because the good people of Earth just got catapulted into a new reality in which there are not only extraterrestrial beings (surprise!) but they are also superman! And a group of them are hell-bent on destroying humankind and taking the planet for themselves.It is difficult to see Superman as separate from the whole Kryptonian Krew.It seems that many moviegoers forgot that Bruce Wayne is also human. Sure, he's a hero, but he is flawed.. Just like the rest of us. He is a vigilante, after all.He has let his vigilantism get the better of him. HE is actually the one working outside the boundaries of the law, not Superman. It is the clear head of Alfred that shows us that he has gone into a rather dark place, that he has not seen what is really going on (in Luthor's scheme), and so he chooses to embark on his own scheme scheme to take out the alien invader. He is (allegedly) thinking of the future: if he wipes out the all-powerful alien, then it can't turn on humankind in the future. At least, he convinces himself of that.A philosophical question is raised in the film: should Clark Kent have remained a simple man from Kansas and never have become the Superman? Should he just let people die and let calamities happen? The question is answered for us in the character of Diana Prince/Wonder Woman. She withdrew from mankind (her exact words) and just sat around watching. Watching while people died horrible deaths all around her. So, should Superman have done the same? Do these special beings, these 'metahumans', have some kind of moral imperative to intervene, or should they be allowed to be regular people, too? It seems that humans want it both ways.It seems that humans are saying: \"Don't be a superalien ... except when I and my friends and family are in trouble. Then come save us.\""

"Batman v Superman: Ultimate Edition: If your looking for a quick, cheap thrill then you might not enjoy this film at the time. This movies theatrical version was butchered by WB and in doing so reshaped the story leaving numerous plot holes. So the Ultimate Edition is the full story and the one worth seeing. Watch 'Man of Steel' before seeing this movie. There is much to claw through here, so much so that the audience might easily find themselves exhausted from the overall aggression of the film. However, a lot of the story does work. The action is good, and the emotion feels real most of the time.This film is about Superman trying to become Superman. Trying to help the world, save people, find a place in this world not as an outcast, and yet is looked at has a threat by many. Superman is not from this world, yet He is trying to be human, find a place in this world, be excepted by earths people, and come into his destiny.This film is also about Batman being Batman for 20 years and losing faith in humanity, and fearing Superman, what Superman can do with his powers. Great film, great plot, great visuals. ---Yidioo"
"I didn't see the film in the theaters and just bought the \"Extended Edition \" on Amazon. I never properly saw Man of Steel- i think I rented it and watched it when already exhausted and fell asleep. I saw the mediocre user reviews and horrible reviews from critics of this film.They really have it wrong. This is the very best either Batman or Superman. It has a different take, on things. Much darker then earlier films even darker then the Christopher Nolan Batman films.First of all Christopher Nolan is an Executive Producer. So how bad could it be? I loved Sucker Punch and Zack Snyder was involved with that. So how bad could this be? Hans Zimmer did the music, so how bad could it be?I remember watching the old Superman TV shows and reading the Superman and Batman comics as a little kid and loved them, but i wouldn't call myself a \"fan boy\" of comic universes, like so many younger people today. As an older adult I will admit my favorite TV show of all time was Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but watched it on DVD only after it had finished. I saw the second of the Dark Knight series in the theater, but the other two, I watched on DVD. They were great, but not my favorite films like so many people. i also loved the first couple Superman and Batman films in the older series. Regardless, i was not waiting with baited breath to see Man of Steel or this one.I'm more of a serious film fan, who can watch Stanley Kubrick films over and over and my favorite films in the last twenty years, are Eyes Wide Shut and Intersteller, both of which i've watched multiple times.So, with that said, take it from me, the critics have this film very wrong, just as critics hated 2001: A Space Odyssey when it first came out. This film will have lasting appreciation.Surprised how much I liked Ben Afleck's Batman. it was hard to get into Henry Cavil's scrawnier looking Superman, but it grew on me. Amy Adams was great as Lois Lane, The Gal Gadol Wonder Women was amazing. Lex Luther was terrific, like Nolan's Joker. Jeremy Irons was the best Alfred ever. Holly Hunter and Diane Lane was good too. The movie had bad reviews but made a billion dollars. Hopefully everyone buys the Ultimate Edition and it breaks sales records and the film is re-appreciated. I have no idea what scenes this Ultimate Edition added, but it is pretty perfect. Now I can't wait for Wonder Woman and the Justice League and as soon as I finish writing this am going to watch Man of Steal. I'm into it now!I can only surmise that the bad reviews stem from too much expectations of the rigid fan boy types and the radical changes in tone, we see in this film.Total masterpiece of cinema, but I have a few criticisms. There are a few hollow scenes of typical Idiot cops and authorities getting everything wrong in a cliché type way and it has a few filler scenes of that type and a few moments here and there that felt rushed and cheesy. Maybe not everything restored into the Ultimate Edition should have been. I wish there had been more Kevin Costner scenes."

"The whole entire Batman V Superman movie was great and yes even though it felt slow to the majority of the people who watched it but to me I enjoyed every part and every scene of Batman V Superman and when it got to the fight scenes both batman VS Superman and the Doomsday fight it brought so much drama, intensity, and epic performances. So with that being said I give this movie a good 10/10 because it really did go to my expectations and it brought a powerful performance and a powerful yet epic introduction to the upcoming Justice League."

"When I first wrote a review for this movie a year ago exclaiming my excitement for the film, I had been high off a fresh dose of live-action DC superheroes playing out the beloved comic book stories that I had grown up on. It was all playing out before my eyes and coming to life. After a few months had passed, I began to notice things about the movie that I disliked: little gaps in the story, things that didn't add up, etc. My original rating of a 10 / 10 dropped to an 8 /10. But today it has gone back up to a 10. The extended version of the film not only rectifies the gaps but also silences critics.Many claimed that the movie was too dark or that it just didn't make sense. To those people, I say: \"Pick up a comic book!\" Many of the critics of this particular film were part of the superhero bandwagon that formed when Marvel began its spree of Avengers-related films. In fact, its estimated that over 60% of people who go to see 'superhero' genre films have never picked up a comic book in their life. I would argue that similar numbers could figure to those which view the CW televised DC Universe shows. People complain that DC comics is just too dark but the fact is that these movies are based upon actual comics which are meant to be dark (ex: The Dark Knight Returns, Injustice, etc.). Its like complaining that Game of Thrones (the TV series) sucks because they kill off too many characters. Read the books! Its frustrating to see such a beautiful work of art like Batman V Superman criticized by those ignorant to its universe and its meaning. This movie is in fact a catalyst that opens numerous doorways and leaves true fans in awe of the possibilities for future movies. But regardless of whether or not people choose to educate themselves, this film's DVD/Blu-ray extended version puts the theater release to shame. All of the plot holes and gaps are filled in 30 minutes of extended footage scattered throughout the film. The movie ultimately becomes more complete and people will wish that the movie had shown the full 3 hours of footage in its theatrical debut. As a major DC comics fan, I will of course pick up on things that a comics fan would not, but someone who does not read comics would learn to appreciate this film in its entirety with the extended version. Get your hands on a copy today or find it on Netflix or the internet somewhere!"

"I ignored the bad reviews and watched anyways. This film had a lot to live up to after Civil War was released and I went into this film expecting the worst. It ended up to be the best Superhero film of 2016 to me. One complaint was that this film was more concerned about universe building than telling a great story than Civil War but for me it was the other way around; Civil War felt like a build up to something else and to be honest, I felt that way when I saw the other MCU films. Batman vs Superman however not only had a great story, but it also felt a lot more consistent than Civil War. This film was way more diverse with the cast than the MCU but unlike the MCU, I felt like this film doesn't go overboard with the SJW stuff like the MCU films or The Star Wars Sequel films do. The Visuals were AMAZING, The Score by Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL was AMAZING as well, The Tone is just right as I actually felt for the characters emotionally, The Cinematography kept my eyes glued to the screen, and the script felt really Intelligent and Complex and despite people calling the writing confusing, I was able to piece it together with no problem whatsoever. This film is similar to Empire Strikes back in terms of popularity so over time after the other movies are released, this movie would probably be more popular.This film was way better than I Expected and deserves another chance.

"Its shame to see what critics and marvel fans did to this movie and targeted Zack Snyder for it. I have seen this movie more than 25 times till date. And i enjoy this movie as much as i enjoyed the first time. The fans who have read DC comics, wouldn't be disappointed in this movie. Its dark movie, yes it is. Because the title shows the intense situation at hand. Two superheroes about to rip each other apart for whatever reasons that brought them to this stage. Yes it had to be dark and intense.Only marvel can be stupid enough to show an alien invasion where humans are loosing the battle and the super heroes are cracking jokes while battles as if they are playing ping pong. a person playing Call of Duty game is more serious while playing than the marvel heroes fighting aliens."

"Last week some news came out from somebody online who had claimed to have seen a finished version of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. If you were like me, you've been leery of checking it out because you weren't sure how much might actually be true. Now Zack Snyder has spoken out about the spoiler-filled post, although his response doesn't really clear anything up.In a word, to MTV, he called the post \"hilarious,which might imply that he's saying that it's mostly, if not entirely, untrue. That might be the case, but then again he could have just said it was untrue and he didn't say that. What he did say, however, is that he doesn't like spoilers. While this may seem odd for the director who's most recent trailer appeared to give away the entire movie, Snyder says that's not the case. Even if you've seen the trailer, you can rest easy, as there is much more we have not seen in then finished film. Says Snyder I have the benefit of seeing the movie. It's cool that think it's too much, and I appreciate people not wanting to know, but there's plenty that they don't know. There's a lot of movie that's not in the trailer. In the process of calling the Batman v Superman Reddit review hilarious, Snyder goes on to talk about how he hates it when spoilers come out. The director would much rather that fans see the movie mostly blind. While he understands that some fans may wish to find the answers before hand, he wants his movies to be mysteries going in. If you're, as an audience member, exploring these articles, looking for answers to questions that you have, maybe you're okay with knowing before you go. It's like an individual taste. But like I said, I want people to see the movie without knowing.Spoilers are a topic that mean different things to different people. While most try to avoid them to some degree, the need to solve the mystery is a nearly universal human experience. We have an inclination to want to know the truth, even while also wanting to be surprised. For most of us getting some information is good, but getting all the information is bad, of course, only getting the details that you want can be difficult."
"The theatrical is choppy, poorly edited, hard to follow, with some really good moments mixed in their. The extended is much more fluent and is much easier to follow, it does have a long runtime, which might make it seem a bit dragging on, but if you like long films done right, like Lord of the Rings, you will like this movie as long as you get into the characters and story. Speaking of which, the story starts out perfectly showing Bruce Wayne as a character, and it is very powerful. There are several moments in this movie that are powerful, emotional, and shocking. Characters. Batman is my favorite fictional character of all time, and believe me when I say, Ben Affleck as Batman was perfect, he had the charisma, the anger, and the look of being through some bad stuff Gal Gadot also does perfect as Wonder Woman, but if you want to really see how good she does, go watch the Wonder Woman movie. Henry Call as Superman. I really don't like it when people say Christopher Reeves is better. Don't get me wrong, Reeves does great, but can you imagine him as Superman in this movie? I wouldn't like it. It would be like Adam West playing Batman in The Dark Knight. Henry Cavill does great in this role, I can say everything about him as I said with Ben Affleck. Jesse Eisenberg as Luthor. I thought it was different in a good way. I've heard a criticism for him as being too much like Joker, but is that a bad thing? Joker is my favorite villain, so to see Superman have an enemy that crazy, but still hold the values Luthor needs to be Luthor, I think it is great. The thing I thought this movie was lacking in the first and second acts was humor, at least good humor. If there was more humor, I would've given this movie a ten because it would give a more relaxing feel to the parts that needed it. All in all though, this movie was awesome, it had powerful moments, it was badass, and just plain fun. It had a great story arc and does its job very well."

"*I will be talking about the Ultimate Edition of the film* This was one of the most anticipated CBM of all time. Ever since the arrival and subsequent success of Marvel's The Avengers people have wondered when will DC launch its own cinematic universe, one of the main reasons being the opportunity to finally see titans such as Batman and Superman share the screen together: the ultimate nerd dream. On 2016, the moment finally came for BvS to be released AND.. it performed poorly. Not only did critical reception left a lot to be desired, but fan reactions where surprisingly split after its cinematic debut. People either loved it and called Zack a genius, or hated it and called him a hack. Me, personally, I found myself with middle of the road feelings, for sure, but more leaning towards the negative side with subsequent viewings. The theatrical cut of the film showcased amazing performances, incredible visuals, and action set pieces that seemed like comic book panels come to life, in a good way. However, when it comes to its narrative structure and more technical aspects like editing, the film was seriously flawed. More plot holes than Age of Ultron, questionable character decisions, random editing that lacked cohesion and focus, and forced dramatic moments that lacked any impact because the attempts at character development ranged from limited to nonexistent, especially when it comes to Superman's character. I thought it was a 5/10 movie at best. As such, I was kind of skeptical about the idea of a 30 minute longer version. I say kind of because I know how Zack works. I remember Watchmen being vastly improved with its director's cut, so in a way I was expecting BvS to perform in a similar manner, but I also feared those 30 minutes wold be just there to amplify action and discredit storytelling issues. Oh boy, I'm so glad I was proved wrong. The ultimate cut of the film was infuriating, but not because it was awful, but because it questions the sanity of WB executives and editors and makes you wonder what were they thinking during the editing process. What I got out of the Ultimate Edition was a thought-provoking deconstruction of two very iconic superheroes that gave spotlight to the struggles both of them face when they aren't fighting crime. What I got was an extremely well produced character study on both Batman and Superman in a cynical world, a world dangerously close to our own. We meet Batman as a ruthless, worn out hero that has seen the failure behind his ideals and witnessed some truly horrifying things in his life. Superman, on the other hand, is portrayed as a godlike figure that seeks to do good in the world, but finds himself emotionally conflicted once he realized that every good deed he does leaves behind a trail of destruction (most of it due to Luthor's antics). In my opinion, this is a hugely original approach, one that distances itself from the rest of the competition and delivers a dark, somber, yet relevant superhero movie that understands both characters and gives them real human struggles to deal with. I felt invested in both of them, and hoped that by the end of the film both could find a way to redeem themselves. Their character arcs were very well established during the first two acts of the movie, and by the time we get to the titular climactic battle the emotion behind the jaw-dropping action is intensified. Lex Luthor as a villain was also given more time to develop with this new edition. One of the main criticisms with the original version was the fact that his plan relied too much on conveniences, and the character's mannerisms and mad-scientist attitude was annoying, and that goes without saying his motivations were unclear. Not only do we spend more time understanding his hate for any godlike figure and thus his hatred for Superman, but the added scenes allowed us to witness his entire plan come to fruition. It sells the cold, manipulative, calculating attributes of his comic counterpart. The acting is spot on. Every actor owns his/her role, from Cavill's Superman, to Ben Affleck as Batman, Eisenberg as Luthor, and Gadot as Wonder Woman, whose scenes are brief, but are more than enough to sell the strong and ferocious warrior that she is. Cinematography is stunning, and miles above that of Man of Steel's. And the soundtrack by Zimmer and Junkie XL? Perfect, just perfect. When it comes to flaws, the film still has some of those. The Martha moment, while serving as a pivotal character moment for Batman, felt off in execution, and its understandable that many people got mad at it. If your main complaint about BvS the first time around was its bleak tone and subject matter, this film is still not for you. I understand most were expecting to see the heroes being the most iconic versions of themselves, clashing in an elongated battle and evoking the same feelings The Avengers gave audiences back in 2012. In that sense, the film will remain divisive, but at least I have the comfort of saying that, at the very least, the film is competently made."

"This film was amazing. Ben Affleck was easily the best part of this movie, he brought his a-game as Batman. The chemistry between Affleck & Irons was outstanding. Gal Gadot did a great job as Wonder Woman. The fight between Batman & Superman was awesome. The final fight with Doomsday was outstanding in every way possible. However, there is only one problem with this film and that's Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor. He was sadly missed cast in this role, but then again it's really the fault of Warner Bros. Studios. Overall, this film deliver on almost every level. I highly recommend that you watch the extended version of this film."

"I know I know. I saw it in theaters too, and felt like it could've been so much better. While the Batman element was good, the narrative felt fractured, and the third act was just one long stunt scene. Superman was relegated to a supporting character, and other characters didn't get a chance to shine. And then I chanced on the ultimate cut. Calling it 30 mins of \"extra\" footage is unfair to Zack Snyder because it's exactly these 30 mins that makes the movie a worthy one. What I can say about the theatrical cut is this - It had the blockbuster elements - music, visuals, stunts, CGI. But, it lacked the human elements. The first 20 mins of the movie had it, but not after that. The extended cut in comparison has a flow to the narrative. There are no disjointed scenes, everything flows smoothly, and there's connective tissue. Superman gets to spend some time with his father, and mother. Clark Kent does some investigative journalism. Superman helps the people after the blast. Lois Lane doesn't jump to conclusions, she gets to the bottom of the crime. Lex Luthor apparently had a coherent plan - everything is explained pretty well. Wonder Woman was already good, so there's no change there :) Also, the \"Martha\" scene seems better executed, because it is a few seconds longer, and there's time to breathe it in. So, here's my take on this movie - The theatrical cut was junk. Get the Bluray for ultimate edition, and you shall not be disappointed. I've seen it so many more times now, and it's the definitive cut. It is the movie we deserve. It's a unique take on Batman, and Superman. It's a gritty take on the superhero movie genre, and definitely the best DCEU movie, and the best DC movie since The Dark Knight.P.S. Yes it's dark. We're adults, and we should appreciate mature film making without intentionally silly moments. It attempts to be philosophical, and something deep instead of just trying to make you chuckle."

"This is one of the best superhero movies ever made. Zack Snyder is a magician behind the camera.The reason behind so many complaints is the fact that Warner Bros. marketed this movie as a fight between Batman and Superman. That's not what it is. It's a movie about the origins of the Justice League.The cinematography, the acting and the score are all second to none. This film is phenomenal.P.S: watch the 3 hour extended cut that Snyder intended you to see, not the 2 and a half hour movie that Warner Bros. decided would be better for theaters."

"I don't care what the critics say, this is a very well-done movie. I'll start my review by listing what I like about the movie.1.) Ben Affleck is the best batman to me and it is not close. He pulls off the role of an aging batman extremely well. Also, Zack Snyder's vision of batman is legit. I have always hated batman up until this adaptation of him. Instead of being a conflicted and idealistic batman, this batman is dark, gritty, and 100% a badass. His equipment is decked out with machine guns and he has no aversion to killing people. In fact, he probably kills about 50 criminal by the time this movie is over. The warehouse scene is the coolest batman scene in any movie.2.) The development of a grudge between batman and superman is pulled off flawlessly. It actually makes sense why batman dislikes superman. Then, when they do fight it is about the coolest thing you can expect to see from a superhero film. 3.) I disagree with a lot of people about Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor. In my opinion, he played his role to perfection. 4.) B v S sets up Wonder Woman and Justice League with Gal Gadot's cameo as Wonder Woman and short clips of Aquaman, the Flash, and Cyborg. B v S is one of my favorite superhero films and rewatching it never gets old."

"The theatrical cut of this film is garbage which is why I rated it eight stars instead of nine. The first time I watched this film I didn't like it (not straight out hate but didn't like). Character motivations didn't make any sense, Lex was annoying as s***, editing was sloppy, and it was overly dark and broody for an action superhero movie. A year + a half, five Marvel films, a ton of bad reviews and a Justice League later a thought popped into my head: \"what if I watched BVS again\". This time I didn't have trailers ruining the best moments, I only vaguely remembered the film, and I was conditioned to look at it negatively but something unexpected happened: I actually loved it. Superman was just a normal person that tried to make a difference cause he could that others imposed their own beliefs on. Lex Luthor was a genius that couldn't stand his powerlessness compared to Superman or more accurately a super being. As Alfred said \"The fever, the rage, the feeling of powerlessness that turns good men... cruel\" and you see the same thought process in Batman. Batman, just like Lex Luthor feels powerless in the midst of a god-being and just like Lex he attempts to destroy him so he can get his sense of power back but unlike Lex, Batman learns something. I what is one of the corniest lines of the movie Superman says, \"Martha\" when he knows he can't win against Batman in a late desperate attempt to save his mother. Not only does this name connect with Bruce Wayne but it also shows what really matters to a man of steel: it isn't power, it isn't fame or anything else, it is his Mother and on a broader scale it is people. Lex (who doesn't care about people at all) knows he doesn't have the power so he creates something from his blood and the remains of Zod: A Doomsday for Superman. Not only does this film have depth but it also doesn't always explain it to you which is rare in a blockbuster action superhero flick normally cater to semi-comic book fans and people that want to shove popcorn in their mouths. This film rewards you for really noticing the details while still having massive explosions. One of my favorites is how Lex has all of Batman's branded killed which is why he isn't afraid of the branding at the end or Grandma's Peach Tea as a way of scaring the s*** out of someone. Of course, this film isn't perfect and I do have personal dislikes. The Batman V Superman fight was slow and pretty boring especially after watching such an amazing fight in Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 2 (If you haven't watched the animated Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 1 and 2 you are sorely missing out on something fantastic). Also, the addition of Wonder Woman who pretty much steals a hacker thing, gives it back and then suits up and fights against a giant monster thing. Not to say I don't like Wonder Woman (She is one of my favorite Superheroes of all time who showed not only can woman kick a** but they also don't need to be ashamed of their sexuality or gender) but she wasn't really that helpful to the plot and just brought in to expand the universe which was well done through Lex's superhuman hunting files. Also, the post-apocalyptic scene that was just a dream could have been cut but nothing is perfect except movies like Citizen Kane which isn't a lot of fun to watch cause it is too perfect. So to summarize, the theatrical cut is bad, the ultimate cut is Amazing and the other cut is meh. Please give it a second chance because it deserves it and save a good director from losing grace because of something he didn't do."
"I really liked it, don't know what all the hate is about. I'm actually a Marvel fan from when I was 7 or so, but Superman and Batman together in 1 movie? Just great. And personally I like Ben Affleck even better than Christian Bale as Batman. So just watch and enjoy, I know I did!"

"That's right. We have been waiting for these two heroes to finally meet and fight against each other. This movie is so good in both plot and special effects.Henry Cavill and Ben Affleck have performed well in their acting stages. They are the best superhero actors and they have filmed their fighting scenes very well. The movie starts to show the conflict between the lives of the heroes and now they have blamed each other for it. This movie is amazing and sets up a good plot for Dawn Justice."

"Actually...I didn't know what to expect. When you see Wonder Woman, you know it will be off of Wonder Woman and off of a Wonder Woman story, but with Batman V Superman, I was like, \"hmmmm, so who is this about?\" It was pretty obvious that it would feature many characters, but I thought the introduction to Batman was amazing. Ben Affleck nailed the part, not only as Batman but also as Bruce Wayne. He is my Batman. Henry Cavill continued to be super as the Man of Steel. And he is my Super - Man. A dark story? Yes, without a doubt. Could it have had a few more jokes? Sure. But not all movies or stories need to have jokes when certain events are serious. I really hope people can see this review and take another look at the movie, because, I loved it. I really hope the ratings can go up, eventually. And P.S, this movie is the perfect set up to Justice League."

"I'll start by making it clear I have only ever seen the Ultimate Edition. I'm aware of what was cut out for the theatrical release, so I will concede up front that most of the criticisms about pacing, editing, and missing bits of plot at release were merited.With that caveat out of the way, I must reiterate that this was bar-none the boldest superhero movie I have ever seen. To me, it was arguably the best as well, though \"best\" shouldn't be taken to mean \"most enjoyable.\" That honor easily goes to \"Thor: Ragnarok.\" What makes BvS stand out among other films in the genre is that it takes two characters who have been done to death since the 1970s and brings them up to date. I recently tried to watch \"Superman: The Movie\" for the first time in a number of years, and while it was still good and Reeves will always be iconic, I just couldn't take it seriously. I'll put it this way: If the story in BvS was \"stupid\" in your view but Superman turning back time by spinning the earth backward on its axis didn't seem like one of the dumbest things you have ever seen -in any movie from any genre- to the extent that it outright ruins the movie for you, then your opinion about BvS isn't worth much. Nostalgic bias was always going to be a problem for this movie, and the way people reacted to and reviewed \"Man of Steel\" was telling in this regard.That brings me to Zack Snyder's take on Superman. You know, that guy whose status as the first extraterrestrial ever encountered by humanity was a total non-issue in the old movies. Apparently, Snyder has a similar view to my own in that his take on the Man of Steel makes his being an alien a core piece of his identity. He may look like any other (absurdly attractive) person, but he knows what he is, and that makes him perpetually uncertain of where he fits in this world. He is essentially good and really does care about people, but he struggles to truly empathize with the likes of us. To be human is to be frail, and that is not something he can easily relate to. This is the root of his conflict with Batman.Just as Clark struggles to genuinely relate to most people, Snyder's Batman either refuses to or otherwise just can't relate to Superman. He doesn't see him as anything but a threat regardless of Superman's clear good intentions. Remember, a small group of Kryptonians were able to bring humanity to the brink of extinction in less than a day, and Bruce Wayne is nothing if not a realist. He didn't know the guy from Kansas. He only knew the god from another world.While Batman's anger toward and fear of Superman are readily apparent from the start, Superman's inability to imagine things from Bruce Wayne's perspective only becomes truly apparent during their first real interaction. This reminded me of the animated version of the \"world's finest\" storyline, where Superman judges Batman harshly for using fear tactics and threats of violence (also, actual violence) to get the job done. Superman wasn't willing to consider what it would take for a human man to fight criminals and save innocents, or what that life would do to him over time. Just as Batman didn't see the guy from Kansas, Superman didn't see the man who lives his life trapped in one brutal, unthinkably traumatic moment (this was beautifully conveyed during the film's opening moments), and had spent his whole adult life bearing witness to humanity at its absolute worst.The conflict between these two characters is as old as human history. They want the same things, but they can't understand one another. So they fight. And what a fight it was.Watching a fight between, say, Captain America and Iron Man was, to me, more frustrating than anything because each understood the other's perspective perfectly. The fight between Batman and Superman in BvS was genuinely gut-wrenching, as intended, because they would have understood one another if either had tried. The whole sequence hilighted Batman's tactical prowess and ability to control a situation. Maybe the most badass thing about the fight was that it ended exactly where Batman planned. That brings me to the big elephant in the room named \"Martha.\"I can't recall exactly which YouTuber put it this way, but if you thought the \"save Martha\" exchange was about their mothers having the same name, you had your brain turned off. The brain-on people have explained this to death, but it bears repeating. This was the moment when Superman became humanized to Batman. He was about to die, and his only concern was for his adoptive human mother. He still believed that the man about to take his life would do the right thing. Even with the cowl on, there was no mistaking the look on Batman's face. It was the look of shame, guilt, and sudden uncertainty that says \"What am I doing?\" Turns out even the most brutal, angry version of Bruce Wayne is better than Tony Stark at knowing right from wrong. At knowing that he had gone too far.From there, the third act was a series of truly impressive (albeit mostly CGI) fight sequences, beginning with what I regard as the undisputed champion of Batman fights. Nothing in the Nolan movies (and especially nothing in the Burton movies) even came close. Go ahead, try to convince yourself that Batman and Bane taking turns punching one another in the face until Bane's mask broke was a good fight sequence. No, this was a fight straight out of \"Arkham Knight,\" and it was glorious. The battle against Doomsday really was one for the books. From the moment Wonder Woman arrived accompanied by the intense sounds of Tina Guo's electric cello to Superman's tragic, heroic death at the hands of Doomsday, I was glued to the screen. Sure, the mere presence of Doomsday spoiled the end to a degree, but watching the Man of Steel laboring to carry that kryptonite spear towards certain death was no less impactful. A brief word on Jesse Eisenberg's take on Lex Luthor. At least one other reviewer on this site already said it best when they pointed out that this was his origin story. If you consider his scheme objectively, he is actually one of the more formidable incarnations of the character. If we're lucky, we'll eventually get to see a Snyder Cut of \"Justice League\" and find out where this story was actually meant to go. For the record, Joss Whedon and Danny Elfman both should have said \"no\" to taking a dump on someone else's art."
"BATMAN V SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE brings a fantastic surprise to a smash-hit team-up with one of the worlds most beloved DC Comics' icons of all time. The movie delivers spectacular casting, and fantastic acting with different characters having their shine in each scenes.The story follows Clark Kent/Superman who becomes a threat, after the destruction in Metropolis in Man Of Steel.(2013). Batman/Bruce Wayne sees him as a threat and begins his war on Superman.The movie brings spectacular storytelling, it tells the complications of human against alien who are on the same side, and the first meeting of Batman and Superman. The story of Bruce Wayne, with his many years of The Caped Crusader, sends him on a spiral of \"out of control\", sheer anger, and builds tension to wanting to defeat the Man of Steel. Snyder has fantastically gave this storytelling an exciting nod to the comics.Lex Luthor, played by Jesse Einsberg, delivers a very interesting performance, but very differently by him showing is his \"origin\" before he becomes a bald foe to the Man of Steel. He shows that his love of \"god vs man\" terrorises mankind when he ultimately creates Doomsday, and Batman realises Superman's inner heroism.It packs so many great \"out of nowhere\" excitement, including a first-look of the fearful Wonder Woman a.k.a. Diana Prince, played by Gal Gadot, and a fresh-new glimpse of the superhero DC canon: The Justice League.WATCH THIS MOVIE! The critics are out of their mind. It's a fun-packed action adventure which still keeps the movie enjoyable until it's final minutes of the movie. It's a FANTASTIC MOVIE! BEN AFFLECK AS BATMAN... is Incredible!A 10/10 overall!"
"I want to go on record as saying that this is a truly thrilling cinematic experience in so many ways. If pressed, I guess I could acknowledge that there were a couple ... let's say \"clumsy\" moments. And in a film that runs to three hours, that hardly seems like a significant issue, certainly not enough to rate it with fewer than 9 stars.This film has everything. There is dramatic tension right from the start. There is a magnificent story arc that picks up quite seamlessly from 'Man of Steel' and propels the viewer not only into the life of Clark Kent/Superman but also of Bruce Wayne/Batman.The villain is no mere cartoon of a villain; he is truly thoroughly (and apparently irrevocably) diabolical. He is a psychopath, and you wish for his death over and over and over. You want Superman to reduce him to ash with the power of his eyes.I have read a number of viewers' reviews, and it seems that the people who disliked the film / gave it a low rating had rather unfair and unrealistic expectations of it. That is, their own prejudices about how the plot could/should unfold or what the character development could/should be, etc. ruined the film for them. And that is a shame.My thought is: I settle into my seat, wait for the lights to dim, and then I wait to be transported by the film. I accept it, lock, stock, and barrel.As another reviewer remarked, I love how the film begins from the point of view of Bruce Wayne as he is among people on the ground who have fallen victim to the attack of Zod and the other Kryptonians.Why would Bruce Wayne not like Superman? Why would the good people of Earth hurl insults at Superman and burn him in effigy (on the news)? Because the good people of Earth just got catapulted into a new reality in which there are not only extraterrestrial beings (surprise!) but they are also superman! And a group of them are hell-bent on destroying humankind and taking the planet for themselves.It is difficult to see Superman as separate from the whole Kryptonian Krew.It seems that many moviegoers forgot that Bruce Wayne is also human. Sure, he's a hero, but he is flawed.. Just like the rest of us. He is a vigilante, after all.He has let his vigilantism get the better of him. HE is actually the one working outside the boundaries of the law, not Superman. It is the clear head of Alfred that shows us that he has gone into a rather dark place, that he has not seen what is really going on (in Luthor's scheme), and so he chooses to embark on his own scheme scheme to take out the alien invader. He is (allegedly) thinking of the future: if he wipes out the all-powerful alien, then it can't turn on humankind in the future. At least, he convinces himself of that.A philosophical question is raised in the film: should Clark Kent have remained a simple man from Kansas and never have become the Superman? Should he just let people die and let calamities happen? The question is answered for us in the character of Diana Prince/Wonder Woman. She withdrew from mankind (her exact words) and just sat around watching. Watching while people died horrible deaths all around her. So, should Superman have done the same? Do these special beings, these 'metahumans', have some kind of moral imperative to intervene, or should they be allowed to be regular people, too? It seems that humans want it both ways.It seems that humans are saying: \"Don't be a superalien ... except when I and my friends and family are in trouble. Then come save us.\""

"Batman v Superman: Ultimate Edition: If your looking for a quick, cheap thrill then you might not enjoy this film at the time. This movies theatrical version was butchered by WB and in doing so reshaped the story leaving numerous plot holes. So the Ultimate Edition is the full story and the one worth seeing. Watch 'Man of Steel' before seeing this movie. There is much to claw through here, so much so that the audience might easily find themselves exhausted from the overall aggression of the film. However, a lot of the story does work. The action is good, and the emotion feels real most of the time.This film is about Superman trying to become Superman. Trying to help the world, save people, find a place in this world not as an outcast, and yet is looked at has a threat by many. Superman is not from this world, yet He is trying to be human, find a place in this world, be excepted by earths people, and come into his destiny.This film is also about Batman being Batman for 20 years and losing faith in humanity, and fearing Superman, what Superman can do with his powers. Great film, great plot, great visuals. ---Yidioo"
"I didn't see the film in the theaters and just bought the \"Extended Edition \" on Amazon. I never properly saw Man of Steel- i think I rented it and watched it when already exhausted and fell asleep. I saw the mediocre user reviews and horrible reviews from critics of this film.They really have it wrong. This is the very best either Batman or Superman. It has a different take, on things. Much darker then earlier films even darker then the Christopher Nolan Batman films.First of all Christopher Nolan is an Executive Producer. So how bad could it be? I loved Sucker Punch and Zack Snyder was involved with that. So how bad could this be? Hans Zimmer did the music, so how bad could it be?I remember watching the old Superman TV shows and reading the Superman and Batman comics as a little kid and loved them, but i wouldn't call myself a \"fan boy\" of comic universes, like so many younger people today. As an older adult I will admit my favorite TV show of all time was Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but watched it on DVD only after it had finished. I saw the second of the Dark Knight series in the theater, but the other two, I watched on DVD. They were great, but not my favorite films like so many people. i also loved the first couple Superman and Batman films in the older series. Regardless, i was not waiting with baited breath to see Man of Steel or this one.I'm more of a serious film fan, who can watch Stanley Kubrick films over and over and my favorite films in the last twenty years, are Eyes Wide Shut and Intersteller, both of which i've watched multiple times.So, with that said, take it from me, the critics have this film very wrong, just as critics hated 2001: A Space Odyssey when it first came out. This film will have lasting appreciation.Surprised how much I liked Ben Afleck's Batman. it was hard to get into Henry Cavil's scrawnier looking Superman, but it grew on me. Amy Adams was great as Lois Lane, The Gal Gadol Wonder Women was amazing. Lex Luther was terrific, like Nolan's Joker. Jeremy Irons was the best Alfred ever. Holly Hunter and Diane Lane was good too. The movie had bad reviews but made a billion dollars. Hopefully everyone buys the Ultimate Edition and it breaks sales records and the film is re-appreciated. I have no idea what scenes this Ultimate Edition added, but it is pretty perfect. Now I can't wait for Wonder Woman and the Justice League and as soon as I finish writing this am going to watch Man of Steal. I'm into it now!I can only surmise that the bad reviews stem from too much expectations of the rigid fan boy types and the radical changes in tone, we see in this film.Total masterpiece of cinema, but I have a few criticisms. There are a few hollow scenes of typical Idiot cops and authorities getting everything wrong in a cliché type way and it has a few filler scenes of that type and a few moments here and there that felt rushed and cheesy. Maybe not everything restored into the Ultimate Edition should have been. I wish there had been more Kevin Costner scenes."

"The whole entire Batman V Superman movie was great and yes even though it felt slow to the majority of the people who watched it but to me I enjoyed every part and every scene of Batman V Superman and when it got to the fight scenes both batman VS Superman and the Doomsday fight it brought so much drama, intensity, and epic performances. So with that being said I give this movie a good 10/10 because it really did go to my expectations and it brought a powerful performance and a powerful yet epic introduction to the upcoming Justice League."

"When I first wrote a review for this movie a year ago exclaiming my excitement for the film, I had been high off a fresh dose of live-action DC superheroes playing out the beloved comic book stories that I had grown up on. It was all playing out before my eyes and coming to life. After a few months had passed, I began to notice things about the movie that I disliked: little gaps in the story, things that didn't add up, etc. My original rating of a 10 / 10 dropped to an 8 /10. But today it has gone back up to a 10. The extended version of the film not only rectifies the gaps but also silences critics.Many claimed that the movie was too dark or that it just didn't make sense. To those people, I say: \"Pick up a comic book!\" Many of the critics of this particular film were part of the superhero bandwagon that formed when Marvel began its spree of Avengers-related films. In fact, its estimated that over 60% of people who go to see 'superhero' genre films have never picked up a comic book in their life. I would argue that similar numbers could figure to those which view the CW televised DC Universe shows. People complain that DC comics is just too dark but the fact is that these movies are based upon actual comics which are meant to be dark (ex: The Dark Knight Returns, Injustice, etc.). Its like complaining that Game of Thrones (the TV series) sucks because they kill off too many characters. Read the books! Its frustrating to see such a beautiful work of art like Batman V Superman criticized by those ignorant to its universe and its meaning. This movie is in fact a catalyst that opens numerous doorways and leaves true fans in awe of the possibilities for future movies. But regardless of whether or not people choose to educate themselves, this film's DVD/Blu-ray extended version puts the theater release to shame. All of the plot holes and gaps are filled in 30 minutes of extended footage scattered throughout the film. The movie ultimately becomes more complete and people will wish that the movie had shown the full 3 hours of footage in its theatrical debut. As a major DC comics fan, I will of course pick up on things that a comics fan would not, but someone who does not read comics would learn to appreciate this film in its entirety with the extended version. Get your hands on a copy today or find it on Netflix or the internet somewhere!"

"I ignored the bad reviews and watched anyways. This film had a lot to live up to after Civil War was released and I went into this film expecting the worst. It ended up to be the best Superhero film of 2016 to me. One complaint was that this film was more concerned about universe building than telling a great story than Civil War but for me it was the other way around; Civil War felt like a build up to something else and to be honest, I felt that way when I saw the other MCU films. Batman vs Superman however not only had a great story, but it also felt a lot more consistent than Civil War. This film was way more diverse with the cast than the MCU but unlike the MCU, I felt like this film doesn't go overboard with the SJW stuff like the MCU films or The Star Wars Sequel films do. The Visuals were AMAZING, The Score by Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL was AMAZING as well, The Tone is just right as I actually felt for the characters emotionally, The Cinematography kept my eyes glued to the screen, and the script felt really Intelligent and Complex and despite people calling the writing confusing, I was able to piece it together with no problem whatsoever. This film is similar to Empire Strikes back in terms of popularity so over time after the other movies are released, this movie would probably be more popular.This film was way better than I Expected and deserves another chance.

"Its shame to see what critics and marvel fans did to this movie and targeted Zack Snyder for it. I have seen this movie more than 25 times till date. And i enjoy this movie as much as i enjoyed the first time. The fans who have read DC comics, wouldn't be disappointed in this movie. Its dark movie, yes it is. Because the title shows the intense situation at hand. Two superheroes about to rip each other apart for whatever reasons that brought them to this stage. Yes it had to be dark and intense.Only marvel can be stupid enough to show an alien invasion where humans are loosing the battle and the super heroes are cracking jokes while battles as if they are playing ping pong. a person playing Call of Duty game is more serious while playing than the marvel heroes fighting aliens."

"Last week some news came out from somebody online who had claimed to have seen a finished version of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. If you were like me, you've been leery of checking it out because you weren't sure how much might actually be true. Now Zack Snyder has spoken out about the spoiler-filled post, although his response doesn't really clear anything up.In a word, to MTV, he called the post \"hilarious,which might imply that he's saying that it's mostly, if not entirely, untrue. That might be the case, but then again he could have just said it was untrue and he didn't say that. What he did say, however, is that he doesn't like spoilers. While this may seem odd for the director who's most recent trailer appeared to give away the entire movie, Snyder says that's not the case. Even if you've seen the trailer, you can rest easy, as there is much more we have not seen in then finished film. Says Snyder I have the benefit of seeing the movie. It's cool that think it's too much, and I appreciate people not wanting to know, but there's plenty that they don't know. There's a lot of movie that's not in the trailer. In the process of calling the Batman v Superman Reddit review hilarious, Snyder goes on to talk about how he hates it when spoilers come out. The director would much rather that fans see the movie mostly blind. While he understands that some fans may wish to find the answers before hand, he wants his movies to be mysteries going in. If you're, as an audience member, exploring these articles, looking for answers to questions that you have, maybe you're okay with knowing before you go. It's like an individual taste. But like I said, I want people to see the movie without knowing.Spoilers are a topic that mean different things to different people. While most try to avoid them to some degree, the need to solve the mystery is a nearly universal human experience. We have an inclination to want to know the truth, even while also wanting to be surprised. For most of us getting some information is good, but getting all the information is bad, of course, only getting the details that you want can be difficult."
"The theatrical is choppy, poorly edited, hard to follow, with some really good moments mixed in their. The extended is much more fluent and is much easier to follow, it does have a long runtime, which might make it seem a bit dragging on, but if you like long films done right, like Lord of the Rings, you will like this movie as long as you get into the characters and story. Speaking of which, the story starts out perfectly showing Bruce Wayne as a character, and it is very powerful. There are several moments in this movie that are powerful, emotional, and shocking. Characters. Batman is my favorite fictional character of all time, and believe me when I say, Ben Affleck as Batman was perfect, he had the charisma, the anger, and the look of being through some bad stuff Gal Gadot also does perfect as Wonder Woman, but if you want to really see how good she does, go watch the Wonder Woman movie. Henry Call as Superman. I really don't like it when people say Christopher Reeves is better. Don't get me wrong, Reeves does great, but can you imagine him as Superman in this movie? I wouldn't like it. It would be like Adam West playing Batman in The Dark Knight. Henry Cavill does great in this role, I can say everything about him as I said with Ben Affleck. Jesse Eisenberg as Luthor. I thought it was different in a good way. I've heard a criticism for him as being too much like Joker, but is that a bad thing? Joker is my favorite villain, so to see Superman have an enemy that crazy, but still hold the values Luthor needs to be Luthor, I think it is great. The thing I thought this movie was lacking in the first and second acts was humor, at least good humor. If there was more humor, I would've given this movie a ten because it would give a more relaxing feel to the parts that needed it. All in all though, this movie was awesome, it had powerful moments, it was badass, and just plain fun. It had a great story arc and does its job very well."

"*I will be talking about the Ultimate Edition of the film* This was one of the most anticipated CBM of all time. Ever since the arrival and subsequent success of Marvel's The Avengers people have wondered when will DC launch its own cinematic universe, one of the main reasons being the opportunity to finally see titans such as Batman and Superman share the screen together: the ultimate nerd dream. On 2016, the moment finally came for BvS to be released AND.. it performed poorly. Not only did critical reception left a lot to be desired, but fan reactions where surprisingly split after its cinematic debut. People either loved it and called Zack a genius, or hated it and called him a hack. Me, personally, I found myself with middle of the road feelings, for sure, but more leaning towards the negative side with subsequent viewings. The theatrical cut of the film showcased amazing performances, incredible visuals, and action set pieces that seemed like comic book panels come to life, in a good way. However, when it comes to its narrative structure and more technical aspects like editing, the film was seriously flawed. More plot holes than Age of Ultron, questionable character decisions, random editing that lacked cohesion and focus, and forced dramatic moments that lacked any impact because the attempts at character development ranged from limited to nonexistent, especially when it comes to Superman's character. I thought it was a 5/10 movie at best. As such, I was kind of skeptical about the idea of a 30 minute longer version. I say kind of because I know how Zack works. I remember Watchmen being vastly improved with its director's cut, so in a way I was expecting BvS to perform in a similar manner, but I also feared those 30 minutes wold be just there to amplify action and discredit storytelling issues. Oh boy, I'm so glad I was proved wrong. The ultimate cut of the film was infuriating, but not because it was awful, but because it questions the sanity of WB executives and editors and makes you wonder what were they thinking during the editing process. What I got out of the Ultimate Edition was a thought-provoking deconstruction of two very iconic superheroes that gave spotlight to the struggles both of them face when they aren't fighting crime. What I got was an extremely well produced character study on both Batman and Superman in a cynical world, a world dangerously close to our own. We meet Batman as a ruthless, worn out hero that has seen the failure behind his ideals and witnessed some truly horrifying things in his life. Superman, on the other hand, is portrayed as a godlike figure that seeks to do good in the world, but finds himself emotionally conflicted once he realized that every good deed he does leaves behind a trail of destruction (most of it due to Luthor's antics). In my opinion, this is a hugely original approach, one that distances itself from the rest of the competition and delivers a dark, somber, yet relevant superhero movie that understands both characters and gives them real human struggles to deal with. I felt invested in both of them, and hoped that by the end of the film both could find a way to redeem themselves. Their character arcs were very well established during the first two acts of the movie, and by the time we get to the titular climactic battle the emotion behind the jaw-dropping action is intensified. Lex Luthor as a villain was also given more time to develop with this new edition. One of the main criticisms with the original version was the fact that his plan relied too much on conveniences, and the character's mannerisms and mad-scientist attitude was annoying, and that goes without saying his motivations were unclear. Not only do we spend more time understanding his hate for any godlike figure and thus his hatred for Superman, but the added scenes allowed us to witness his entire plan come to fruition. It sells the cold, manipulative, calculating attributes of his comic counterpart. The acting is spot on. Every actor owns his/her role, from Cavill's Superman, to Ben Affleck as Batman, Eisenberg as Luthor, and Gadot as Wonder Woman, whose scenes are brief, but are more than enough to sell the strong and ferocious warrior that she is. Cinematography is stunning, and miles above that of Man of Steel's. And the soundtrack by Zimmer and Junkie XL? Perfect, just perfect. When it comes to flaws, the film still has some of those. The Martha moment, while serving as a pivotal character moment for Batman, felt off in execution, and its understandable that many people got mad at it. If your main complaint about BvS the first time around was its bleak tone and subject matter, this film is still not for you. I understand most were expecting to see the heroes being the most iconic versions of themselves, clashing in an elongated battle and evoking the same feelings The Avengers gave audiences back in 2012. In that sense, the film will remain divisive, but at least I have the comfort of saying that, at the very least, the film is competently made."

"This film was amazing. Ben Affleck was easily the best part of this movie, he brought his a-game as Batman. The chemistry between Affleck & Irons was outstanding. Gal Gadot did a great job as Wonder Woman. The fight between Batman & Superman was awesome. The final fight with Doomsday was outstanding in every way possible. However, there is only one problem with this film and that's Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor. He was sadly missed cast in this role, but then again it's really the fault of Warner Bros. Studios. Overall, this film deliver on almost every level. I highly recommend that you watch the extended version of this film."

"I know I know. I saw it in theaters too, and felt like it could've been so much better. While the Batman element was good, the narrative felt fractured, and the third act was just one long stunt scene. Superman was relegated to a supporting character, and other characters didn't get a chance to shine. And then I chanced on the ultimate cut. Calling it 30 mins of \"extra\" footage is unfair to Zack Snyder because it's exactly these 30 mins that makes the movie a worthy one. What I can say about the theatrical cut is this - It had the blockbuster elements - music, visuals, stunts, CGI. But, it lacked the human elements. The first 20 mins of the movie had it, but not after that. The extended cut in comparison has a flow to the narrative. There are no disjointed scenes, everything flows smoothly, and there's connective tissue. Superman gets to spend some time with his father, and mother. Clark Kent does some investigative journalism. Superman helps the people after the blast. Lois Lane doesn't jump to conclusions, she gets to the bottom of the crime. Lex Luthor apparently had a coherent plan - everything is explained pretty well. Wonder Woman was already good, so there's no change there :) Also, the \"Martha\" scene seems better executed, because it is a few seconds longer, and there's time to breathe it in. So, here's my take on this movie - The theatrical cut was junk. Get the Bluray for ultimate edition, and you shall not be disappointed. I've seen it so many more times now, and it's the definitive cut. It is the movie we deserve. It's a unique take on Batman, and Superman. It's a gritty take on the superhero movie genre, and definitely the best DCEU movie, and the best DC movie since The Dark Knight.P.S. Yes it's dark. We're adults, and we should appreciate mature film making without intentionally silly moments. It attempts to be philosophical, and something deep instead of just trying to make you chuckle."

"This is one of the best superhero movies ever made. Zack Snyder is a magician behind the camera.The reason behind so many complaints is the fact that Warner Bros. marketed this movie as a fight between Batman and Superman. That's not what it is. It's a movie about the origins of the Justice League.The cinematography, the acting and the score are all second to none. This film is phenomenal.P.S: watch the 3 hour extended cut that Snyder intended you to see, not the 2 and a half hour movie that Warner Bros. decided would be better for theaters."

"I don't care what the critics say, this is a very well-done movie. I'll start my review by listing what I like about the movie.1.) Ben Affleck is the best batman to me and it is not close. He pulls off the role of an aging batman extremely well. Also, Zack Snyder's vision of batman is legit. I have always hated batman up until this adaptation of him. Instead of being a conflicted and idealistic batman, this batman is dark, gritty, and 100% a badass. His equipment is decked out with machine guns and he has no aversion to killing people. In fact, he probably kills about 50 criminal by the time this movie is over. The warehouse scene is the coolest batman scene in any movie.2.) The development of a grudge between batman and superman is pulled off flawlessly. It actually makes sense why batman dislikes superman. Then, when they do fight it is about the coolest thing you can expect to see from a superhero film. 3.) I disagree with a lot of people about Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor. In my opinion, he played his role to perfection. 4.) B v S sets up Wonder Woman and Justice League with Gal Gadot's cameo as Wonder Woman and short clips of Aquaman, the Flash, and Cyborg. B v S is one of my favorite superhero films and rewatching it never gets old."

"The theatrical cut of this film is garbage which is why I rated it eight stars instead of nine. The first time I watched this film I didn't like it (not straight out hate but didn't like). Character motivations didn't make any sense, Lex was annoying as s***, editing was sloppy, and it was overly dark and broody for an action superhero movie. A year + a half, five Marvel films, a ton of bad reviews and a Justice League later a thought popped into my head: \"what if I watched BVS again\". This time I didn't have trailers ruining the best moments, I only vaguely remembered the film, and I was conditioned to look at it negatively but something unexpected happened: I actually loved it. Superman was just a normal person that tried to make a difference cause he could that others imposed their own beliefs on. Lex Luthor was a genius that couldn't stand his powerlessness compared to Superman or more accurately a super being. As Alfred said \"The fever, the rage, the feeling of powerlessness that turns good men... cruel\" and you see the same thought process in Batman. Batman, just like Lex Luthor feels powerless in the midst of a god-being and just like Lex he attempts to destroy him so he can get his sense of power back but unlike Lex, Batman learns something. I what is one of the corniest lines of the movie Superman says, \"Martha\" when he knows he can't win against Batman in a late desperate attempt to save his mother. Not only does this name connect with Bruce Wayne but it also shows what really matters to a man of steel: it isn't power, it isn't fame or anything else, it is his Mother and on a broader scale it is people. Lex (who doesn't care about people at all) knows he doesn't have the power so he creates something from his blood and the remains of Zod: A Doomsday for Superman. Not only does this film have depth but it also doesn't always explain it to you which is rare in a blockbuster action superhero flick normally cater to semi-comic book fans and people that want to shove popcorn in their mouths. This film rewards you for really noticing the details while still having massive explosions. One of my favorites is how Lex has all of Batman's branded killed which is why he isn't afraid of the branding at the end or Grandma's Peach Tea as a way of scaring the s*** out of someone. Of course, this film isn't perfect and I do have personal dislikes. The Batman V Superman fight was slow and pretty boring especially after watching such an amazing fight in Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 2 (If you haven't watched the animated Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 1 and 2 you are sorely missing out on something fantastic). Also, the addition of Wonder Woman who pretty much steals a hacker thing, gives it back and then suits up and fights against a giant monster thing. Not to say I don't like Wonder Woman (She is one of my favorite Superheroes of all time who showed not only can woman kick a** but they also don't need to be ashamed of their sexuality or gender) but she wasn't really that helpful to the plot and just brought in to expand the universe which was well done through Lex's superhuman hunting files. Also, the post-apocalyptic scene that was just a dream could have been cut but nothing is perfect except movies like Citizen Kane which isn't a lot of fun to watch cause it is too perfect. So to summarize, the theatrical cut is bad, the ultimate cut is Amazing and the other cut is meh. Please give it a second chance because it deserves it and save a good director from losing grace because of something he didn't do."
"I really liked it, don't know what all the hate is about. I'm actually a Marvel fan from when I was 7 or so, but Superman and Batman together in 1 movie? Just great. And personally I like Ben Affleck even better than Christian Bale as Batman. So just watch and enjoy, I know I did!"

"That's right. We have been waiting for these two heroes to finally meet and fight against each other. This movie is so good in both plot and special effects.Henry Cavill and Ben Affleck have performed well in their acting stages. They are the best superhero actors and they have filmed their fighting scenes very well. The movie starts to show the conflict between the lives of the heroes and now they have blamed each other for it. This movie is amazing and sets up a good plot for Dawn Justice."

"Actually...I didn't know what to expect. When you see Wonder Woman, you know it will be off of Wonder Woman and off of a Wonder Woman story, but with Batman V Superman, I was like, \"hmmmm, so who is this about?\" It was pretty obvious that it would feature many characters, but I thought the introduction to Batman was amazing. Ben Affleck nailed the part, not only as Batman but also as Bruce Wayne. He is my Batman. Henry Cavill continued to be super as the Man of Steel. And he is my Super - Man. A dark story? Yes, without a doubt. Could it have had a few more jokes? Sure. But not all movies or stories need to have jokes when certain events are serious. I really hope people can see this review and take another look at the movie, because, I loved it. I really hope the ratings can go up, eventually. And P.S, this movie is the perfect set up to Justice League."

"I'll start by making it clear I have only ever seen the Ultimate Edition. I'm aware of what was cut out for the theatrical release, so I will concede up front that most of the criticisms about pacing, editing, and missing bits of plot at release were merited.With that caveat out of the way, I must reiterate that this was bar-none the boldest superhero movie I have ever seen. To me, it was arguably the best as well, though \"best\" shouldn't be taken to mean \"most enjoyable.\" That honor easily goes to \"Thor: Ragnarok.\" What makes BvS stand out among other films in the genre is that it takes two characters who have been done to death since the 1970s and brings them up to date. I recently tried to watch \"Superman: The Movie\" for the first time in a number of years, and while it was still good and Reeves will always be iconic, I just couldn't take it seriously. I'll put it this way: If the story in BvS was \"stupid\" in your view but Superman turning back time by spinning the earth backward on its axis didn't seem like one of the dumbest things you have ever seen -in any movie from any genre- to the extent that it outright ruins the movie for you, then your opinion about BvS isn't worth much. Nostalgic bias was always going to be a problem for this movie, and the way people reacted to and reviewed \"Man of Steel\" was telling in this regard.That brings me to Zack Snyder's take on Superman. You know, that guy whose status as the first extraterrestrial ever encountered by humanity was a total non-issue in the old movies. Apparently, Snyder has a similar view to my own in that his take on the Man of Steel makes his being an alien a core piece of his identity. He may look like any other (absurdly attractive) person, but he knows what he is, and that makes him perpetually uncertain of where he fits in this world. He is essentially good and really does care about people, but he struggles to truly empathize with the likes of us. To be human is to be frail, and that is not something he can easily relate to. This is the root of his conflict with Batman.Just as Clark struggles to genuinely relate to most people, Snyder's Batman either refuses to or otherwise just can't relate to Superman. He doesn't see him as anything but a threat regardless of Superman's clear good intentions. Remember, a small group of Kryptonians were able to bring humanity to the brink of extinction in less than a day, and Bruce Wayne is nothing if not a realist. He didn't know the guy from Kansas. He only knew the god from another world.While Batman's anger toward and fear of Superman are readily apparent from the start, Superman's inability to imagine things from Bruce Wayne's perspective only becomes truly apparent during their first real interaction. This reminded me of the animated version of the \"world's finest\" storyline, where Superman judges Batman harshly for using fear tactics and threats of violence (also, actual violence) to get the job done. Superman wasn't willing to consider what it would take for a human man to fight criminals and save innocents, or what that life would do to him over time. Just as Batman didn't see the guy from Kansas, Superman didn't see the man who lives his life trapped in one brutal, unthinkably traumatic moment (this was beautifully conveyed during the film's opening moments), and had spent his whole adult life bearing witness to humanity at its absolute worst.The conflict between these two characters is as old as human history. They want the same things, but they can't understand one another. So they fight. And what a fight it was.Watching a fight between, say, Captain America and Iron Man was, to me, more frustrating than anything because each understood the other's perspective perfectly. The fight between Batman and Superman in BvS was genuinely gut-wrenching, as intended, because they would have understood one another if either had tried. The whole sequence hilighted Batman's tactical prowess and ability to control a situation. Maybe the most badass thing about the fight was that it ended exactly where Batman planned. That brings me to the big elephant in the room named \"Martha.\"I can't recall exactly which YouTuber put it this way, but if you thought the \"save Martha\" exchange was about their mothers having the same name, you had your brain turned off. The brain-on people have explained this to death, but it bears repeating. This was the moment when Superman became humanized to Batman. He was about to die, and his only concern was for his adoptive human mother. He still believed that the man about to take his life would do the right thing. Even with the cowl on, there was no mistaking the look on Batman's face. It was the look of shame, guilt, and sudden uncertainty that says \"What am I doing?\" Turns out even the most brutal, angry version of Bruce Wayne is better than Tony Stark at knowing right from wrong. At knowing that he had gone too far.From there, the third act was a series of truly impressive (albeit mostly CGI) fight sequences, beginning with what I regard as the undisputed champion of Batman fights. Nothing in the Nolan movies (and especially nothing in the Burton movies) even came close. Go ahead, try to convince yourself that Batman and Bane taking turns punching one another in the face until Bane's mask broke was a good fight sequence. No, this was a fight straight out of \"Arkham Knight,\" and it was glorious. The battle against Doomsday really was one for the books. From the moment Wonder Woman arrived accompanied by the intense sounds of Tina Guo's electric cello to Superman's tragic, heroic death at the hands of Doomsday, I was glued to the screen. Sure, the mere presence of Doomsday spoiled the end to a degree, but watching the Man of Steel laboring to carry that kryptonite spear towards certain death was no less impactful. A brief word on Jesse Eisenberg's take on Lex Luthor. At least one other reviewer on this site already said it best when they pointed out that this was his origin story. If you consider his scheme objectively, he is actually one of the more formidable incarnations of the character. If we're lucky, we'll eventually get to see a Snyder Cut of \"Justice League\" and find out where this story was actually meant to go. For the record, Joss Whedon and Danny Elfman both should have said \"no\" to taking a dump on someone else's art."
"BATMAN V SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE brings a fantastic surprise to a smash-hit team-up with one of the worlds most beloved DC Comics' icons of all time. The movie delivers spectacular casting, and fantastic acting with different characters having their shine in each scenes.The story follows Clark Kent/Superman who becomes a threat, after the destruction in Metropolis in Man Of Steel.(2013). Batman/Bruce Wayne sees him as a threat and begins his war on Superman.The movie brings spectacular storytelling, it tells the complications of human against alien who are on the same side, and the first meeting of Batman and Superman. The story of Bruce Wayne, with his many years of The Caped Crusader, sends him on a spiral of \"out of control\", sheer anger, and builds tension to wanting to defeat the Man of Steel. Snyder has fantastically gave this storytelling an exciting nod to the comics.Lex Luthor, played by Jesse Einsberg, delivers a very interesting performance, but very differently by him showing is his \"origin\" before he becomes a bald foe to the Man of Steel. He shows that his love of \"god vs man\" terrorises mankind when he ultimately creates Doomsday, and Batman realises Superman's inner heroism.It packs so many great \"out of nowhere\" excitement, including a first-look of the fearful Wonder Woman a.k.a. Diana Prince, played by Gal Gadot, and a fresh-new glimpse of the superhero DC canon: The Justice League.WATCH THIS MOVIE! The critics are out of their mind. It's a fun-packed action adventure which still keeps the movie enjoyable until it's final minutes of the movie. It's a FANTASTIC MOVIE! BEN AFFLECK AS BATMAN... is Incredible!A 10/10 overall!"
"I want to go on record as saying that this is a truly thrilling cinematic experience in so many ways. If pressed, I guess I could acknowledge that there were a couple ... let's say \"clumsy\" moments. And in a film that runs to three hours, that hardly seems like a significant issue, certainly not enough to rate it with fewer than 9 stars.This film has everything. There is dramatic tension right from the start. There is a magnificent story arc that picks up quite seamlessly from 'Man of Steel' and propels the viewer not only into the life of Clark Kent/Superman but also of Bruce Wayne/Batman.The villain is no mere cartoon of a villain; he is truly thoroughly (and apparently irrevocably) diabolical. He is a psychopath, and you wish for his death over and over and over. You want Superman to reduce him to ash with the power of his eyes.I have read a number of viewers' reviews, and it seems that the people who disliked the film / gave it a low rating had rather unfair and unrealistic expectations of it. That is, their own prejudices about how the plot could/should unfold or what the character development could/should be, etc. ruined the film for them. And that is a shame.My thought is: I settle into my seat, wait for the lights to dim, and then I wait to be transported by the film. I accept it, lock, stock, and barrel.As another reviewer remarked, I love how the film begins from the point of view of Bruce Wayne as he is among people on the ground who have fallen victim to the attack of Zod and the other Kryptonians.Why would Bruce Wayne not like Superman? Why would the good people of Earth hurl insults at Superman and burn him in effigy (on the news)? Because the good people of Earth just got catapulted into a new reality in which there are not only extraterrestrial beings (surprise!) but they are also superman! And a group of them are hell-bent on destroying humankind and taking the planet for themselves.It is difficult to see Superman as separate from the whole Kryptonian Krew.It seems that many moviegoers forgot that Bruce Wayne is also human. Sure, he's a hero, but he is flawed.. Just like the rest of us. He is a vigilante, after all.He has let his vigilantism get the better of him. HE is actually the one working outside the boundaries of the law, not Superman. It is the clear head of Alfred that shows us that he has gone into a rather dark place, that he has not seen what is really going on (in Luthor's scheme), and so he chooses to embark on his own scheme scheme to take out the alien invader. He is (allegedly) thinking of the future: if he wipes out the all-powerful alien, then it can't turn on humankind in the future. At least, he convinces himself of that.A philosophical question is raised in the film: should Clark Kent have remained a simple man from Kansas and never have become the Superman? Should he just let people die and let calamities happen? The question is answered for us in the character of Diana Prince/Wonder Woman. She withdrew from mankind (her exact words) and just sat around watching. Watching while people died horrible deaths all around her. So, should Superman have done the same? Do these special beings, these 'metahumans', have some kind of moral imperative to intervene, or should they be allowed to be regular people, too? It seems that humans want it both ways.It seems that humans are saying: \"Don't be a superalien ... except when I and my friends and family are in trouble. Then come save us.\""

"Batman v Superman: Ultimate Edition: If your looking for a quick, cheap thrill then you might not enjoy this film at the time. This movies theatrical version was butchered by WB and in doing so reshaped the story leaving numerous plot holes. So the Ultimate Edition is the full story and the one worth seeing. Watch 'Man of Steel' before seeing this movie. There is much to claw through here, so much so that the audience might easily find themselves exhausted from the overall aggression of the film. However, a lot of the story does work. The action is good, and the emotion feels real most of the time.This film is about Superman trying to become Superman. Trying to help the world, save people, find a place in this world not as an outcast, and yet is looked at has a threat by many. Superman is not from this world, yet He is trying to be human, find a place in this world, be excepted by earths people, and come into his destiny.This film is also about Batman being Batman for 20 years and losing faith in humanity, and fearing Superman, what Superman can do with his powers. Great film, great plot, great visuals. ---Yidioo"
"I didn't see the film in the theaters and just bought the \"Extended Edition \" on Amazon. I never properly saw Man of Steel- i think I rented it and watched it when already exhausted and fell asleep. I saw the mediocre user reviews and horrible reviews from critics of this film.They really have it wrong. This is the very best either Batman or Superman. It has a different take, on things. Much darker then earlier films even darker then the Christopher Nolan Batman films.First of all Christopher Nolan is an Executive Producer. So how bad could it be? I loved Sucker Punch and Zack Snyder was involved with that. So how bad could this be? Hans Zimmer did the music, so how bad could it be?I remember watching the old Superman TV shows and reading the Superman and Batman comics as a little kid and loved them, but i wouldn't call myself a \"fan boy\" of comic universes, like so many younger people today. As an older adult I will admit my favorite TV show of all time was Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but watched it on DVD only after it had finished. I saw the second of the Dark Knight series in the theater, but the other two, I watched on DVD. They were great, but not my favorite films like so many people. i also loved the first couple Superman and Batman films in the older series. Regardless, i was not waiting with baited breath to see Man of Steel or this one.I'm more of a serious film fan, who can watch Stanley Kubrick films over and over and my favorite films in the last twenty years, are Eyes Wide Shut and Intersteller, both of which i've watched multiple times.So, with that said, take it from me, the critics have this film very wrong, just as critics hated 2001: A Space Odyssey when it first came out. This film will have lasting appreciation.Surprised how much I liked Ben Afleck's Batman. it was hard to get into Henry Cavil's scrawnier looking Superman, but it grew on me. Amy Adams was great as Lois Lane, The Gal Gadol Wonder Women was amazing. Lex Luther was terrific, like Nolan's Joker. Jeremy Irons was the best Alfred ever. Holly Hunter and Diane Lane was good too. The movie had bad reviews but made a billion dollars. Hopefully everyone buys the Ultimate Edition and it breaks sales records and the film is re-appreciated. I have no idea what scenes this Ultimate Edition added, but it is pretty perfect. Now I can't wait for Wonder Woman and the Justice League and as soon as I finish writing this am going to watch Man of Steal. I'm into it now!I can only surmise that the bad reviews stem from too much expectations of the rigid fan boy types and the radical changes in tone, we see in this film.Total masterpiece of cinema, but I have a few criticisms. There are a few hollow scenes of typical Idiot cops and authorities getting everything wrong in a cliché type way and it has a few filler scenes of that type and a few moments here and there that felt rushed and cheesy. Maybe not everything restored into the Ultimate Edition should have been. I wish there had been more Kevin Costner scenes."

"The whole entire Batman V Superman movie was great and yes even though it felt slow to the majority of the people who watched it but to me I enjoyed every part and every scene of Batman V Superman and when it got to the fight scenes both batman VS Superman and the Doomsday fight it brought so much drama, intensity, and epic performances. So with that being said I give this movie a good 10/10 because it really did go to my expectations and it brought a powerful performance and a powerful yet epic introduction to the upcoming Justice League."

"When I first wrote a review for this movie a year ago exclaiming my excitement for the film, I had been high off a fresh dose of live-action DC superheroes playing out the beloved comic book stories that I had grown up on. It was all playing out before my eyes and coming to life. After a few months had passed, I began to notice things about the movie that I disliked: little gaps in the story, things that didn't add up, etc. My original rating of a 10 / 10 dropped to an 8 /10. But today it has gone back up to a 10. The extended version of the film not only rectifies the gaps but also silences critics.Many claimed that the movie was too dark or that it just didn't make sense. To those people, I say: \"Pick up a comic book!\" Many of the critics of this particular film were part of the superhero bandwagon that formed when Marvel began its spree of Avengers-related films. In fact, its estimated that over 60% of people who go to see 'superhero' genre films have never picked up a comic book in their life. I would argue that similar numbers could figure to those which view the CW televised DC Universe shows. People complain that DC comics is just too dark but the fact is that these movies are based upon actual comics which are meant to be dark (ex: The Dark Knight Returns, Injustice, etc.). Its like complaining that Game of Thrones (the TV series) sucks because they kill off too many characters. Read the books! Its frustrating to see such a beautiful work of art like Batman V Superman criticized by those ignorant to its universe and its meaning. This movie is in fact a catalyst that opens numerous doorways and leaves true fans in awe of the possibilities for future movies. But regardless of whether or not people choose to educate themselves, this film's DVD/Blu-ray extended version puts the theater release to shame. All of the plot holes and gaps are filled in 30 minutes of extended footage scattered throughout the film. The movie ultimately becomes more complete and people will wish that the movie had shown the full 3 hours of footage in its theatrical debut. As a major DC comics fan, I will of course pick up on things that a comics fan would not, but someone who does not read comics would learn to appreciate this film in its entirety with the extended version. Get your hands on a copy today or find it on Netflix or the internet somewhere!"

"I ignored the bad reviews and watched anyways. This film had a lot to live up to after Civil War was released and I went into this film expecting the worst. It ended up to be the best Superhero film of 2016 to me. One complaint was that this film was more concerned about universe building than telling a great story than Civil War but for me it was the other way around; Civil War felt like a build up to something else and to be honest, I felt that way when I saw the other MCU films. Batman vs Superman however not only had a great story, but it also felt a lot more consistent than Civil War. This film was way more diverse with the cast than the MCU but unlike the MCU, I felt like this film doesn't go overboard with the SJW stuff like the MCU films or The Star Wars Sequel films do. The Visuals were AMAZING, The Score by Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL was AMAZING as well, The Tone is just right as I actually felt for the characters emotionally, The Cinematography kept my eyes glued to the screen, and the script felt really Intelligent and Complex and despite people calling the writing confusing, I was able to piece it together with no problem whatsoever. This film is similar to Empire Strikes back in terms of popularity so over time after the other movies are released, this movie would probably be more popular.This film was way better than I Expected and deserves another chance.

"Its shame to see what critics and marvel fans did to this movie and targeted Zack Snyder for it. I have seen this movie more than 25 times till date. And i enjoy this movie as much as i enjoyed the first time. The fans who have read DC comics, wouldn't be disappointed in this movie. Its dark movie, yes it is. Because the title shows the intense situation at hand. Two superheroes about to rip each other apart for whatever reasons that brought them to this stage. Yes it had to be dark and intense.Only marvel can be stupid enough to show an alien invasion where humans are loosing the battle and the super heroes are cracking jokes while battles as if they are playing ping pong. a person playing Call of Duty game is more serious while playing than the marvel heroes fighting aliens."

"Last week some news came out from somebody online who had claimed to have seen a finished version of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. If you were like me, you've been leery of checking it out because you weren't sure how much might actually be true. Now Zack Snyder has spoken out about the spoiler-filled post, although his response doesn't really clear anything up.In a word, to MTV, he called the post \"hilarious,which might imply that he's saying that it's mostly, if not entirely, untrue. That might be the case, but then again he could have just said it was untrue and he didn't say that. What he did say, however, is that he doesn't like spoilers. While this may seem odd for the director who's most recent trailer appeared to give away the entire movie, Snyder says that's not the case. Even if you've seen the trailer, you can rest easy, as there is much more we have not seen in then finished film. Says Snyder I have the benefit of seeing the movie. It's cool that think it's too much, and I appreciate people not wanting to know, but there's plenty that they don't know. There's a lot of movie that's not in the trailer. In the process of calling the Batman v Superman Reddit review hilarious, Snyder goes on to talk about how he hates it when spoilers come out. The director would much rather that fans see the movie mostly blind. While he understands that some fans may wish to find the answers before hand, he wants his movies to be mysteries going in. If you're, as an audience member, exploring these articles, looking for answers to questions that you have, maybe you're okay with knowing before you go. It's like an individual taste. But like I said, I want people to see the movie without knowing.Spoilers are a topic that mean different things to different people. While most try to avoid them to some degree, the need to solve the mystery is a nearly universal human experience. We have an inclination to want to know the truth, even while also wanting to be surprised. For most of us getting some information is good, but getting all the information is bad, of course, only getting the details that you want can be difficult."
"The theatrical is choppy, poorly edited, hard to follow, with some really good moments mixed in their. The extended is much more fluent and is much easier to follow, it does have a long runtime, which might make it seem a bit dragging on, but if you like long films done right, like Lord of the Rings, you will like this movie as long as you get into the characters and story. Speaking of which, the story starts out perfectly showing Bruce Wayne as a character, and it is very powerful. There are several moments in this movie that are powerful, emotional, and shocking. Characters. Batman is my favorite fictional character of all time, and believe me when I say, Ben Affleck as Batman was perfect, he had the charisma, the anger, and the look of being through some bad stuff Gal Gadot also does perfect as Wonder Woman, but if you want to really see how good she does, go watch the Wonder Woman movie. Henry Call as Superman. I really don't like it when people say Christopher Reeves is better. Don't get me wrong, Reeves does great, but can you imagine him as Superman in this movie? I wouldn't like it. It would be like Adam West playing Batman in The Dark Knight. Henry Cavill does great in this role, I can say everything about him as I said with Ben Affleck. Jesse Eisenberg as Luthor. I thought it was different in a good way. I've heard a criticism for him as being too much like Joker, but is that a bad thing? Joker is my favorite villain, so to see Superman have an enemy that crazy, but still hold the values Luthor needs to be Luthor, I think it is great. The thing I thought this movie was lacking in the first and second acts was humor, at least good humor. If there was more humor, I would've given this movie a ten because it would give a more relaxing feel to the parts that needed it. All in all though, this movie was awesome, it had powerful moments, it was badass, and just plain fun. It had a great story arc and does its job very well."

"*I will be talking about the Ultimate Edition of the film* This was one of the most anticipated CBM of all time. Ever since the arrival and subsequent success of Marvel's The Avengers people have wondered when will DC launch its own cinematic universe, one of the main reasons being the opportunity to finally see titans such as Batman and Superman share the screen together: the ultimate nerd dream. On 2016, the moment finally came for BvS to be released AND.. it performed poorly. Not only did critical reception left a lot to be desired, but fan reactions where surprisingly split after its cinematic debut. People either loved it and called Zack a genius, or hated it and called him a hack. Me, personally, I found myself with middle of the road feelings, for sure, but more leaning towards the negative side with subsequent viewings. The theatrical cut of the film showcased amazing performances, incredible visuals, and action set pieces that seemed like comic book panels come to life, in a good way. However, when it comes to its narrative structure and more technical aspects like editing, the film was seriously flawed. More plot holes than Age of Ultron, questionable character decisions, random editing that lacked cohesion and focus, and forced dramatic moments that lacked any impact because the attempts at character development ranged from limited to nonexistent, especially when it comes to Superman's character. I thought it was a 5/10 movie at best. As such, I was kind of skeptical about the idea of a 30 minute longer version. I say kind of because I know how Zack works. I remember Watchmen being vastly improved with its director's cut, so in a way I was expecting BvS to perform in a similar manner, but I also feared those 30 minutes wold be just there to amplify action and discredit storytelling issues. Oh boy, I'm so glad I was proved wrong. The ultimate cut of the film was infuriating, but not because it was awful, but because it questions the sanity of WB executives and editors and makes you wonder what were they thinking during the editing process. What I got out of the Ultimate Edition was a thought-provoking deconstruction of two very iconic superheroes that gave spotlight to the struggles both of them face when they aren't fighting crime. What I got was an extremely well produced character study on both Batman and Superman in a cynical world, a world dangerously close to our own. We meet Batman as a ruthless, worn out hero that has seen the failure behind his ideals and witnessed some truly horrifying things in his life. Superman, on the other hand, is portrayed as a godlike figure that seeks to do good in the world, but finds himself emotionally conflicted once he realized that every good deed he does leaves behind a trail of destruction (most of it due to Luthor's antics). In my opinion, this is a hugely original approach, one that distances itself from the rest of the competition and delivers a dark, somber, yet relevant superhero movie that understands both characters and gives them real human struggles to deal with. I felt invested in both of them, and hoped that by the end of the film both could find a way to redeem themselves. Their character arcs were very well established during the first two acts of the movie, and by the time we get to the titular climactic battle the emotion behind the jaw-dropping action is intensified. Lex Luthor as a villain was also given more time to develop with this new edition. One of the main criticisms with the original version was the fact that his plan relied too much on conveniences, and the character's mannerisms and mad-scientist attitude was annoying, and that goes without saying his motivations were unclear. Not only do we spend more time understanding his hate for any godlike figure and thus his hatred for Superman, but the added scenes allowed us to witness his entire plan come to fruition. It sells the cold, manipulative, calculating attributes of his comic counterpart. The acting is spot on. Every actor owns his/her role, from Cavill's Superman, to Ben Affleck as Batman, Eisenberg as Luthor, and Gadot as Wonder Woman, whose scenes are brief, but are more than enough to sell the strong and ferocious warrior that she is. Cinematography is stunning, and miles above that of Man of Steel's. And the soundtrack by Zimmer and Junkie XL? Perfect, just perfect. When it comes to flaws, the film still has some of those. The Martha moment, while serving as a pivotal character moment for Batman, felt off in execution, and its understandable that many people got mad at it. If your main complaint about BvS the first time around was its bleak tone and subject matter, this film is still not for you. I understand most were expecting to see the heroes being the most iconic versions of themselves, clashing in an elongated battle and evoking the same feelings The Avengers gave audiences back in 2012. In that sense, the film will remain divisive, but at least I have the comfort of saying that, at the very least, the film is competently made."

"This film was amazing. Ben Affleck was easily the best part of this movie, he brought his a-game as Batman. The chemistry between Affleck & Irons was outstanding. Gal Gadot did a great job as Wonder Woman. The fight between Batman & Superman was awesome. The final fight with Doomsday was outstanding in every way possible. However, there is only one problem with this film and that's Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor. He was sadly missed cast in this role, but then again it's really the fault of Warner Bros. Studios. Overall, this film deliver on almost every level. I highly recommend that you watch the extended version of this film."

"I know I know. I saw it in theaters too, and felt like it could've been so much better. While the Batman element was good, the narrative felt fractured, and the third act was just one long stunt scene. Superman was relegated to a supporting character, and other characters didn't get a chance to shine. And then I chanced on the ultimate cut. Calling it 30 mins of \"extra\" footage is unfair to Zack Snyder because it's exactly these 30 mins that makes the movie a worthy one. What I can say about the theatrical cut is this - It had the blockbuster elements - music, visuals, stunts, CGI. But, it lacked the human elements. The first 20 mins of the movie had it, but not after that. The extended cut in comparison has a flow to the narrative. There are no disjointed scenes, everything flows smoothly, and there's connective tissue. Superman gets to spend some time with his father, and mother. Clark Kent does some investigative journalism. Superman helps the people after the blast. Lois Lane doesn't jump to conclusions, she gets to the bottom of the crime. Lex Luthor apparently had a coherent plan - everything is explained pretty well. Wonder Woman was already good, so there's no change there :) Also, the \"Martha\" scene seems better executed, because it is a few seconds longer, and there's time to breathe it in. So, here's my take on this movie - The theatrical cut was junk. Get the Bluray for ultimate edition, and you shall not be disappointed. I've seen it so many more times now, and it's the definitive cut. It is the movie we deserve. It's a unique take on Batman, and Superman. It's a gritty take on the superhero movie genre, and definitely the best DCEU movie, and the best DC movie since The Dark Knight.P.S. Yes it's dark. We're adults, and we should appreciate mature film making without intentionally silly moments. It attempts to be philosophical, and something deep instead of just trying to make you chuckle."

"This is one of the best superhero movies ever made. Zack Snyder is a magician behind the camera.The reason behind so many complaints is the fact that Warner Bros. marketed this movie as a fight between Batman and Superman. That's not what it is. It's a movie about the origins of the Justice League.The cinematography, the acting and the score are all second to none. This film is phenomenal.P.S: watch the 3 hour extended cut that Snyder intended you to see, not the 2 and a half hour movie that Warner Bros. decided would be better for theaters."

"I don't care what the critics say, this is a very well-done movie. I'll start my review by listing what I like about the movie.1.) Ben Affleck is the best batman to me and it is not close. He pulls off the role of an aging batman extremely well. Also, Zack Snyder's vision of batman is legit. I have always hated batman up until this adaptation of him. Instead of being a conflicted and idealistic batman, this batman is dark, gritty, and 100% a badass. His equipment is decked out with machine guns and he has no aversion to killing people. In fact, he probably kills about 50 criminal by the time this movie is over. The warehouse scene is the coolest batman scene in any movie.2.) The development of a grudge between batman and superman is pulled off flawlessly. It actually makes sense why batman dislikes superman. Then, when they do fight it is about the coolest thing you can expect to see from a superhero film. 3.) I disagree with a lot of people about Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor. In my opinion, he played his role to perfection. 4.) B v S sets up Wonder Woman and Justice League with Gal Gadot's cameo as Wonder Woman and short clips of Aquaman, the Flash, and Cyborg. B v S is one of my favorite superhero films and rewatching it never gets old."

"The theatrical cut of this film is garbage which is why I rated it eight stars instead of nine. The first time I watched this film I didn't like it (not straight out hate but didn't like). Character motivations didn't make any sense, Lex was annoying as s***, editing was sloppy, and it was overly dark and broody for an action superhero movie. A year + a half, five Marvel films, a ton of bad reviews and a Justice League later a thought popped into my head: \"what if I watched BVS again\". This time I didn't have trailers ruining the best moments, I only vaguely remembered the film, and I was conditioned to look at it negatively but something unexpected happened: I actually loved it. Superman was just a normal person that tried to make a difference cause he could that others imposed their own beliefs on. Lex Luthor was a genius that couldn't stand his powerlessness compared to Superman or more accurately a super being. As Alfred said \"The fever, the rage, the feeling of powerlessness that turns good men... cruel\" and you see the same thought process in Batman. Batman, just like Lex Luthor feels powerless in the midst of a god-being and just like Lex he attempts to destroy him so he can get his sense of power back but unlike Lex, Batman learns something. I what is one of the corniest lines of the movie Superman says, \"Martha\" when he knows he can't win against Batman in a late desperate attempt to save his mother. Not only does this name connect with Bruce Wayne but it also shows what really matters to a man of steel: it isn't power, it isn't fame or anything else, it is his Mother and on a broader scale it is people. Lex (who doesn't care about people at all) knows he doesn't have the power so he creates something from his blood and the remains of Zod: A Doomsday for Superman. Not only does this film have depth but it also doesn't always explain it to you which is rare in a blockbuster action superhero flick normally cater to semi-comic book fans and people that want to shove popcorn in their mouths. This film rewards you for really noticing the details while still having massive explosions. One of my favorites is how Lex has all of Batman's branded killed which is why he isn't afraid of the branding at the end or Grandma's Peach Tea as a way of scaring the s*** out of someone. Of course, this film isn't perfect and I do have personal dislikes. The Batman V Superman fight was slow and pretty boring especially after watching such an amazing fight in Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 2 (If you haven't watched the animated Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 1 and 2 you are sorely missing out on something fantastic). Also, the addition of Wonder Woman who pretty much steals a hacker thing, gives it back and then suits up and fights against a giant monster thing. Not to say I don't like Wonder Woman (She is one of my favorite Superheroes of all time who showed not only can woman kick a** but they also don't need to be ashamed of their sexuality or gender) but she wasn't really that helpful to the plot and just brought in to expand the universe which was well done through Lex's superhuman hunting files. Also, the post-apocalyptic scene that was just a dream could have been cut but nothing is perfect except movies like Citizen Kane which isn't a lot of fun to watch cause it is too perfect. So to summarize, the theatrical cut is bad, the ultimate cut is Amazing and the other cut is meh. Please give it a second chance because it deserves it and save a good director from losing grace because of something he didn't do."
"I really liked it, don't know what all the hate is about. I'm actually a Marvel fan from when I was 7 or so, but Superman and Batman together in 1 movie? Just great. And personally I like Ben Affleck even better than Christian Bale as Batman. So just watch and enjoy, I know I did!"

"That's right. We have been waiting for these two heroes to finally meet and fight against each other. This movie is so good in both plot and special effects.Henry Cavill and Ben Affleck have performed well in their acting stages. They are the best superhero actors and they have filmed their fighting scenes very well. The movie starts to show the conflict between the lives of the heroes and now they have blamed each other for it. This movie is amazing and sets up a good plot for Dawn Justice."

"Actually...I didn't know what to expect. When you see Wonder Woman, you know it will be off of Wonder Woman and off of a Wonder Woman story, but with Batman V Superman, I was like, \"hmmmm, so who is this about?\" It was pretty obvious that it would feature many characters, but I thought the introduction to Batman was amazing. Ben Affleck nailed the part, not only as Batman but also as Bruce Wayne. He is my Batman. Henry Cavill continued to be super as the Man of Steel. And he is my Super - Man. A dark story? Yes, without a doubt. Could it have had a few more jokes? Sure. But not all movies or stories need to have jokes when certain events are serious. I really hope people can see this review and take another look at the movie, because, I loved it. I really hope the ratings can go up, eventually. And P.S, this movie is the perfect set up to Justice League."

"I'll start by making it clear I have only ever seen the Ultimate Edition. I'm aware of what was cut out for the theatrical release, so I will concede up front that most of the criticisms about pacing, editing, and missing bits of plot at release were merited.With that caveat out of the way, I must reiterate that this was bar-none the boldest superhero movie I have ever seen. To me, it was arguably the best as well, though \"best\" shouldn't be taken to mean \"most enjoyable.\" That honor easily goes to \"Thor: Ragnarok.\" What makes BvS stand out among other films in the genre is that it takes two characters who have been done to death since the 1970s and brings them up to date. I recently tried to watch \"Superman: The Movie\" for the first time in a number of years, and while it was still good and Reeves will always be iconic, I just couldn't take it seriously. I'll put it this way: If the story in BvS was \"stupid\" in your view but Superman turning back time by spinning the earth backward on its axis didn't seem like one of the dumbest things you have ever seen -in any movie from any genre- to the extent that it outright ruins the movie for you, then your opinion about BvS isn't worth much. Nostalgic bias was always going to be a problem for this movie, and the way people reacted to and reviewed \"Man of Steel\" was telling in this regard.That brings me to Zack Snyder's take on Superman. You know, that guy whose status as the first extraterrestrial ever encountered by humanity was a total non-issue in the old movies. Apparently, Snyder has a similar view to my own in that his take on the Man of Steel makes his being an alien a core piece of his identity. He may look like any other (absurdly attractive) person, but he knows what he is, and that makes him perpetually uncertain of where he fits in this world. He is essentially good and really does care about people, but he struggles to truly empathize with the likes of us. To be human is to be frail, and that is not something he can easily relate to. This is the root of his conflict with Batman.Just as Clark struggles to genuinely relate to most people, Snyder's Batman either refuses to or otherwise just can't relate to Superman. He doesn't see him as anything but a threat regardless of Superman's clear good intentions. Remember, a small group of Kryptonians were able to bring humanity to the brink of extinction in less than a day, and Bruce Wayne is nothing if not a realist. He didn't know the guy from Kansas. He only knew the god from another world.While Batman's anger toward and fear of Superman are readily apparent from the start, Superman's inability to imagine things from Bruce Wayne's perspective only becomes truly apparent during their first real interaction. This reminded me of the animated version of the \"world's finest\" storyline, where Superman judges Batman harshly for using fear tactics and threats of violence (also, actual violence) to get the job done. Superman wasn't willing to consider what it would take for a human man to fight criminals and save innocents, or what that life would do to him over time. Just as Batman didn't see the guy from Kansas, Superman didn't see the man who lives his life trapped in one brutal, unthinkably traumatic moment (this was beautifully conveyed during the film's opening moments), and had spent his whole adult life bearing witness to humanity at its absolute worst.The conflict between these two characters is as old as human history. They want the same things, but they can't understand one another. So they fight. And what a fight it was.Watching a fight between, say, Captain America and Iron Man was, to me, more frustrating than anything because each understood the other's perspective perfectly. The fight between Batman and Superman in BvS was genuinely gut-wrenching, as intended, because they would have understood one another if either had tried. The whole sequence hilighted Batman's tactical prowess and ability to control a situation. Maybe the most badass thing about the fight was that it ended exactly where Batman planned. That brings me to the big elephant in the room named \"Martha.\"I can't recall exactly which YouTuber put it this way, but if you thought the \"save Martha\" exchange was about their mothers having the same name, you had your brain turned off. The brain-on people have explained this to death, but it bears repeating. This was the moment when Superman became humanized to Batman. He was about to die, and his only concern was for his adoptive human mother. He still believed that the man about to take his life would do the right thing. Even with the cowl on, there was no mistaking the look on Batman's face. It was the look of shame, guilt, and sudden uncertainty that says \"What am I doing?\" Turns out even the most brutal, angry version of Bruce Wayne is better than Tony Stark at knowing right from wrong. At knowing that he had gone too far.From there, the third act was a series of truly impressive (albeit mostly CGI) fight sequences, beginning with what I regard as the undisputed champion of Batman fights. Nothing in the Nolan movies (and especially nothing in the Burton movies) even came close. Go ahead, try to convince yourself that Batman and Bane taking turns punching one another in the face until Bane's mask broke was a good fight sequence. No, this was a fight straight out of \"Arkham Knight,\" and it was glorious. The battle against Doomsday really was one for the books. From the moment Wonder Woman arrived accompanied by the intense sounds of Tina Guo's electric cello to Superman's tragic, heroic death at the hands of Doomsday, I was glued to the screen. Sure, the mere presence of Doomsday spoiled the end to a degree, but watching the Man of Steel laboring to carry that kryptonite spear towards certain death was no less impactful. A brief word on Jesse Eisenberg's take on Lex Luthor. At least one other reviewer on this site already said it best when they pointed out that this was his origin story. If you consider his scheme objectively, he is actually one of the more formidable incarnations of the character. If we're lucky, we'll eventually get to see a Snyder Cut of \"Justice League\" and find out where this story was actually meant to go. For the record, Joss Whedon and Danny Elfman both should have said \"no\" to taking a dump on someone else's art."
"BATMAN V SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE brings a fantastic surprise to a smash-hit team-up with one of the worlds most beloved DC Comics' icons of all time. The movie delivers spectacular casting, and fantastic acting with different characters having their shine in each scenes.The story follows Clark Kent/Superman who becomes a threat, after the destruction in Metropolis in Man Of Steel.(2013). Batman/Bruce Wayne sees him as a threat and begins his war on Superman.The movie brings spectacular storytelling, it tells the complications of human against alien who are on the same side, and the first meeting of Batman and Superman. The story of Bruce Wayne, with his many years of The Caped Crusader, sends him on a spiral of \"out of control\", sheer anger, and builds tension to wanting to defeat the Man of Steel. Snyder has fantastically gave this storytelling an exciting nod to the comics.Lex Luthor, played by Jesse Einsberg, delivers a very interesting performance, but very differently by him showing is his \"origin\" before he becomes a bald foe to the Man of Steel. He shows that his love of \"god vs man\" terrorises mankind when he ultimately creates Doomsday, and Batman realises Superman's inner heroism.It packs so many great \"out of nowhere\" excitement, including a first-look of the fearful Wonder Woman a.k.a. Diana Prince, played by Gal Gadot, and a fresh-new glimpse of the superhero DC canon: The Justice League.WATCH THIS MOVIE! The critics are out of their mind. It's a fun-packed action adventure which still keeps the movie enjoyable until it's final minutes of the movie. It's a FANTASTIC MOVIE! BEN AFFLECK AS BATMAN... is Incredible!A 10/10 overall!"
"I want to go on record as saying that this is a truly thrilling cinematic experience in so many ways. If pressed, I guess I could acknowledge that there were a couple ... let's say \"clumsy\" moments. And in a film that runs to three hours, that hardly seems like a significant issue, certainly not enough to rate it with fewer than 9 stars.This film has everything. There is dramatic tension right from the start. There is a magnificent story arc that picks up quite seamlessly from 'Man of Steel' and propels the viewer not only into the life of Clark Kent/Superman but also of Bruce Wayne/Batman.The villain is no mere cartoon of a villain; he is truly thoroughly (and apparently irrevocably) diabolical. He is a psychopath, and you wish for his death over and over and over. You want Superman to reduce him to ash with the power of his eyes.I have read a number of viewers' reviews, and it seems that the people who disliked the film / gave it a low rating had rather unfair and unrealistic expectations of it. That is, their own prejudices about how the plot could/should unfold or what the character development could/should be, etc. ruined the film for them. And that is a shame.My thought is: I settle into my seat, wait for the lights to dim, and then I wait to be transported by the film. I accept it, lock, stock, and barrel.As another reviewer remarked, I love how the film begins from the point of view of Bruce Wayne as he is among people on the ground who have fallen victim to the attack of Zod and the other Kryptonians.Why would Bruce Wayne not like Superman? Why would the good people of Earth hurl insults at Superman and burn him in effigy (on the news)? Because the good people of Earth just got catapulted into a new reality in which there are not only extraterrestrial beings (surprise!) but they are also superman! And a group of them are hell-bent on destroying humankind and taking the planet for themselves.It is difficult to see Superman as separate from the whole Kryptonian Krew.It seems that many moviegoers forgot that Bruce Wayne is also human. Sure, he's a hero, but he is flawed.. Just like the rest of us. He is a vigilante, after all.He has let his vigilantism get the better of him. HE is actually the one working outside the boundaries of the law, not Superman. It is the clear head of Alfred that shows us that he has gone into a rather dark place, that he has not seen what is really going on (in Luthor's scheme), and so he chooses to embark on his own scheme scheme to take out the alien invader. He is (allegedly) thinking of the future: if he wipes out the all-powerful alien, then it can't turn on humankind in the future. At least, he convinces himself of that.A philosophical question is raised in the film: should Clark Kent have remained a simple man from Kansas and never have become the Superman? Should he just let people die and let calamities happen? The question is answered for us in the character of Diana Prince/Wonder Woman. She withdrew from mankind (her exact words) and just sat around watching. Watching while people died horrible deaths all around her. So, should Superman have done the same? Do these special beings, these 'metahumans', have some kind of moral imperative to intervene, or should they be allowed to be regular people, too? It seems that humans want it both ways.It seems that humans are saying: \"Don't be a superalien ... except when I and my friends and family are in trouble. Then come save us.\""

"Batman v Superman: Ultimate Edition: If your looking for a quick, cheap thrill then you might not enjoy this film at the time. This movies theatrical version was butchered by WB and in doing so reshaped the story leaving numerous plot holes. So the Ultimate Edition is the full story and the one worth seeing. Watch 'Man of Steel' before seeing this movie. There is much to claw through here, so much so that the audience might easily find themselves exhausted from the overall aggression of the film. However, a lot of the story does work. The action is good, and the emotion feels real most of the time.This film is about Superman trying to become Superman. Trying to help the world, save people, find a place in this world not as an outcast, and yet is looked at has a threat by many. Superman is not from this world, yet He is trying to be human, find a place in this world, be excepted by earths people, and come into his destiny.This film is also about Batman being Batman for 20 years and losing faith in humanity, and fearing Superman, what Superman can do with his powers. Great film, great plot, great visuals. ---Yidioo"
"I didn't see the film in the theaters and just bought the \"Extended Edition \" on Amazon. I never properly saw Man of Steel- i think I rented it and watched it when already exhausted and fell asleep. I saw the mediocre user reviews and horrible reviews from critics of this film.They really have it wrong. This is the very best either Batman or Superman. It has a different take, on things. Much darker then earlier films even darker then the Christopher Nolan Batman films.First of all Christopher Nolan is an Executive Producer. So how bad could it be? I loved Sucker Punch and Zack Snyder was involved with that. So how bad could this be? Hans Zimmer did the music, so how bad could it be?I remember watching the old Superman TV shows and reading the Superman and Batman comics as a little kid and loved them, but i wouldn't call myself a \"fan boy\" of comic universes, like so many younger people today. As an older adult I will admit my favorite TV show of all time was Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but watched it on DVD only after it had finished. I saw the second of the Dark Knight series in the theater, but the other two, I watched on DVD. They were great, but not my favorite films like so many people. i also loved the first couple Superman and Batman films in the older series. Regardless, i was not waiting with baited breath to see Man of Steel or this one.I'm more of a serious film fan, who can watch Stanley Kubrick films over and over and my favorite films in the last twenty years, are Eyes Wide Shut and Intersteller, both of which i've watched multiple times.So, with that said, take it from me, the critics have this film very wrong, just as critics hated 2001: A Space Odyssey when it first came out. This film will have lasting appreciation.Surprised how much I liked Ben Afleck's Batman. it was hard to get into Henry Cavil's scrawnier looking Superman, but it grew on me. Amy Adams was great as Lois Lane, The Gal Gadol Wonder Women was amazing. Lex Luther was terrific, like Nolan's Joker. Jeremy Irons was the best Alfred ever. Holly Hunter and Diane Lane was good too. The movie had bad reviews but made a billion dollars. Hopefully everyone buys the Ultimate Edition and it breaks sales records and the film is re-appreciated. I have no idea what scenes this Ultimate Edition added, but it is pretty perfect. Now I can't wait for Wonder Woman and the Justice League and as soon as I finish writing this am going to watch Man of Steal. I'm into it now!I can only surmise that the bad reviews stem from too much expectations of the rigid fan boy types and the radical changes in tone, we see in this film.Total masterpiece of cinema, but I have a few criticisms. There are a few hollow scenes of typical Idiot cops and authorities getting everything wrong in a cliché type way and it has a few filler scenes of that type and a few moments here and there that felt rushed and cheesy. Maybe not everything restored into the Ultimate Edition should have been. I wish there had been more Kevin Costner scenes."

"The whole entire Batman V Superman movie was great and yes even though it felt slow to the majority of the people who watched it but to me I enjoyed every part and every scene of Batman V Superman and when it got to the fight scenes both batman VS Superman and the Doomsday fight it brought so much drama, intensity, and epic performances. So with that being said I give this movie a good 10/10 because it really did go to my expectations and it brought a powerful performance and a powerful yet epic introduction to the upcoming Justice League."

"When I first wrote a review for this movie a year ago exclaiming my excitement for the film, I had been high off a fresh dose of live-action DC superheroes playing out the beloved comic book stories that I had grown up on. It was all playing out before my eyes and coming to life. After a few months had passed, I began to notice things about the movie that I disliked: little gaps in the story, things that didn't add up, etc. My original rating of a 10 / 10 dropped to an 8 /10. But today it has gone back up to a 10. The extended version of the film not only rectifies the gaps but also silences critics.Many claimed that the movie was too dark or that it just didn't make sense. To those people, I say: \"Pick up a comic book!\" Many of the critics of this particular film were part of the superhero bandwagon that formed when Marvel began its spree of Avengers-related films. In fact, its estimated that over 60% of people who go to see 'superhero' genre films have never picked up a comic book in their life. I would argue that similar numbers could figure to those which view the CW televised DC Universe shows. People complain that DC comics is just too dark but the fact is that these movies are based upon actual comics which are meant to be dark (ex: The Dark Knight Returns, Injustice, etc.). Its like complaining that Game of Thrones (the TV series) sucks because they kill off too many characters. Read the books! Its frustrating to see such a beautiful work of art like Batman V Superman criticized by those ignorant to its universe and its meaning. This movie is in fact a catalyst that opens numerous doorways and leaves true fans in awe of the possibilities for future movies. But regardless of whether or not people choose to educate themselves, this film's DVD/Blu-ray extended version puts the theater release to shame. All of the plot holes and gaps are filled in 30 minutes of extended footage scattered throughout the film. The movie ultimately becomes more complete and people will wish that the movie had shown the full 3 hours of footage in its theatrical debut. As a major DC comics fan, I will of course pick up on things that a comics fan would not, but someone who does not read comics would learn to appreciate this film in its entirety with the extended version. Get your hands on a copy today or find it on Netflix or the internet somewhere!"

"I ignored the bad reviews and watched anyways. This film had a lot to live up to after Civil War was released and I went into this film expecting the worst. It ended up to be the best Superhero film of 2016 to me. One complaint was that this film was more concerned about universe building than telling a great story than Civil War but for me it was the other way around; Civil War felt like a build up to something else and to be honest, I felt that way when I saw the other MCU films. Batman vs Superman however not only had a great story, but it also felt a lot more consistent than Civil War. This film was way more diverse with the cast than the MCU but unlike the MCU, I felt like this film doesn't go overboard with the SJW stuff like the MCU films or The Star Wars Sequel films do. The Visuals were AMAZING, The Score by Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL was AMAZING as well, The Tone is just right as I actually felt for the characters emotionally, The Cinematography kept my eyes glued to the screen, and the script felt really Intelligent and Complex and despite people calling the writing confusing, I was able to piece it together with no problem whatsoever. This film is similar to Empire Strikes back in terms of popularity so over time after the other movies are released, this movie would probably be more popular.This film was way better than I Expected and deserves another chance.

"Its shame to see what critics and marvel fans did to this movie and targeted Zack Snyder for it. I have seen this movie more than 25 times till date. And i enjoy this movie as much as i enjoyed the first time. The fans who have read DC comics, wouldn't be disappointed in this movie. Its dark movie, yes it is. Because the title shows the intense situation at hand. Two superheroes about to rip each other apart for whatever reasons that brought them to this stage. Yes it had to be dark and intense.Only marvel can be stupid enough to show an alien invasion where humans are loosing the battle and the super heroes are cracking jokes while battles as if they are playing ping pong. a person playing Call of Duty game is more serious while playing than the marvel heroes fighting aliens."

"Last week some news came out from somebody online who had claimed to have seen a finished version of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. If you were like me, you've been leery of checking it out because you weren't sure how much might actually be true. Now Zack Snyder has spoken out about the spoiler-filled post, although his response doesn't really clear anything up.In a word, to MTV, he called the post \"hilarious,which might imply that he's saying that it's mostly, if not entirely, untrue. That might be the case, but then again he could have just said it was untrue and he didn't say that. What he did say, however, is that he doesn't like spoilers. While this may seem odd for the director who's most recent trailer appeared to give away the entire movie, Snyder says that's not the case. Even if you've seen the trailer, you can rest easy, as there is much more we have not seen in then finished film. Says Snyder I have the benefit of seeing the movie. It's cool that think it's too much, and I appreciate people not wanting to know, but there's plenty that they don't know. There's a lot of movie that's not in the trailer. In the process of calling the Batman v Superman Reddit review hilarious, Snyder goes on to talk about how he hates it when spoilers come out. The director would much rather that fans see the movie mostly blind. While he understands that some fans may wish to find the answers before hand, he wants his movies to be mysteries going in. If you're, as an audience member, exploring these articles, looking for answers to questions that you have, maybe you're okay with knowing before you go. It's like an individual taste. But like I said, I want people to see the movie without knowing.Spoilers are a topic that mean different things to different people. While most try to avoid them to some degree, the need to solve the mystery is a nearly universal human experience. We have an inclination to want to know the truth, even while also wanting to be surprised. For most of us getting some information is good, but getting all the information is bad, of course, only getting the details that you want can be difficult."
"The theatrical is choppy, poorly edited, hard to follow, with some really good moments mixed in their. The extended is much more fluent and is much easier to follow, it does have a long runtime, which might make it seem a bit dragging on, but if you like long films done right, like Lord of the Rings, you will like this movie as long as you get into the characters and story. Speaking of which, the story starts out perfectly showing Bruce Wayne as a character, and it is very powerful. There are several moments in this movie that are powerful, emotional, and shocking. Characters. Batman is my favorite fictional character of all time, and believe me when I say, Ben Affleck as Batman was perfect, he had the charisma, the anger, and the look of being through some bad stuff Gal Gadot also does perfect as Wonder Woman, but if you want to really see how good she does, go watch the Wonder Woman movie. Henry Call as Superman. I really don't like it when people say Christopher Reeves is better. Don't get me wrong, Reeves does great, but can you imagine him as Superman in this movie? I wouldn't like it. It would be like Adam West playing Batman in The Dark Knight. Henry Cavill does great in this role, I can say everything about him as I said with Ben Affleck. Jesse Eisenberg as Luthor. I thought it was different in a good way. I've heard a criticism for him as being too much like Joker, but is that a bad thing? Joker is my favorite villain, so to see Superman have an enemy that crazy, but still hold the values Luthor needs to be Luthor, I think it is great. The thing I thought this movie was lacking in the first and second acts was humor, at least good humor. If there was more humor, I would've given this movie a ten because it would give a more relaxing feel to the parts that needed it. All in all though, this movie was awesome, it had powerful moments, it was badass, and just plain fun. It had a great story arc and does its job very well."

"*I will be talking about the Ultimate Edition of the film* This was one of the most anticipated CBM of all time. Ever since the arrival and subsequent success of Marvel's The Avengers people have wondered when will DC launch its own cinematic universe, one of the main reasons being the opportunity to finally see titans such as Batman and Superman share the screen together: the ultimate nerd dream. On 2016, the moment finally came for BvS to be released AND.. it performed poorly. Not only did critical reception left a lot to be desired, but fan reactions where surprisingly split after its cinematic debut. People either loved it and called Zack a genius, or hated it and called him a hack. Me, personally, I found myself with middle of the road feelings, for sure, but more leaning towards the negative side with subsequent viewings. The theatrical cut of the film showcased amazing performances, incredible visuals, and action set pieces that seemed like comic book panels come to life, in a good way. However, when it comes to its narrative structure and more technical aspects like editing, the film was seriously flawed. More plot holes than Age of Ultron, questionable character decisions, random editing that lacked cohesion and focus, and forced dramatic moments that lacked any impact because the attempts at character development ranged from limited to nonexistent, especially when it comes to Superman's character. I thought it was a 5/10 movie at best. As such, I was kind of skeptical about the idea of a 30 minute longer version. I say kind of because I know how Zack works. I remember Watchmen being vastly improved with its director's cut, so in a way I was expecting BvS to perform in a similar manner, but I also feared those 30 minutes wold be just there to amplify action and discredit storytelling issues. Oh boy, I'm so glad I was proved wrong. The ultimate cut of the film was infuriating, but not because it was awful, but because it questions the sanity of WB executives and editors and makes you wonder what were they thinking during the editing process. What I got out of the Ultimate Edition was a thought-provoking deconstruction of two very iconic superheroes that gave spotlight to the struggles both of them face when they aren't fighting crime. What I got was an extremely well produced character study on both Batman and Superman in a cynical world, a world dangerously close to our own. We meet Batman as a ruthless, worn out hero that has seen the failure behind his ideals and witnessed some truly horrifying things in his life. Superman, on the other hand, is portrayed as a godlike figure that seeks to do good in the world, but finds himself emotionally conflicted once he realized that every good deed he does leaves behind a trail of destruction (most of it due to Luthor's antics). In my opinion, this is a hugely original approach, one that distances itself from the rest of the competition and delivers a dark, somber, yet relevant superhero movie that understands both characters and gives them real human struggles to deal with. I felt invested in both of them, and hoped that by the end of the film both could find a way to redeem themselves. Their character arcs were very well established during the first two acts of the movie, and by the time we get to the titular climactic battle the emotion behind the jaw-dropping action is intensified. Lex Luthor as a villain was also given more time to develop with this new edition. One of the main criticisms with the original version was the fact that his plan relied too much on conveniences, and the character's mannerisms and mad-scientist attitude was annoying, and that goes without saying his motivations were unclear. Not only do we spend more time understanding his hate for any godlike figure and thus his hatred for Superman, but the added scenes allowed us to witness his entire plan come to fruition. It sells the cold, manipulative, calculating attributes of his comic counterpart. The acting is spot on. Every actor owns his/her role, from Cavill's Superman, to Ben Affleck as Batman, Eisenberg as Luthor, and Gadot as Wonder Woman, whose scenes are brief, but are more than enough to sell the strong and ferocious warrior that she is. Cinematography is stunning, and miles above that of Man of Steel's. And the soundtrack by Zimmer and Junkie XL? Perfect, just perfect. When it comes to flaws, the film still has some of those. The Martha moment, while serving as a pivotal character moment for Batman, felt off in execution, and its understandable that many people got mad at it. If your main complaint about BvS the first time around was its bleak tone and subject matter, this film is still not for you. I understand most were expecting to see the heroes being the most iconic versions of themselves, clashing in an elongated battle and evoking the same feelings The Avengers gave audiences back in 2012. In that sense, the film will remain divisive, but at least I have the comfort of saying that, at the very least, the film is competently made."

"This film was amazing. Ben Affleck was easily the best part of this movie, he brought his a-game as Batman. The chemistry between Affleck & Irons was outstanding. Gal Gadot did a great job as Wonder Woman. The fight between Batman & Superman was awesome. The final fight with Doomsday was outstanding in every way possible. However, there is only one problem with this film and that's Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor. He was sadly missed cast in this role, but then again it's really the fault of Warner Bros. Studios. Overall, this film deliver on almost every level. I highly recommend that you watch the extended version of this film."

"I know I know. I saw it in theaters too, and felt like it could've been so much better. While the Batman element was good, the narrative felt fractured, and the third act was just one long stunt scene. Superman was relegated to a supporting character, and other characters didn't get a chance to shine. And then I chanced on the ultimate cut. Calling it 30 mins of \"extra\" footage is unfair to Zack Snyder because it's exactly these 30 mins that makes the movie a worthy one. What I can say about the theatrical cut is this - It had the blockbuster elements - music, visuals, stunts, CGI. But, it lacked the human elements. The first 20 mins of the movie had it, but not after that. The extended cut in comparison has a flow to the narrative. There are no disjointed scenes, everything flows smoothly, and there's connective tissue. Superman gets to spend some time with his father, and mother. Clark Kent does some investigative journalism. Superman helps the people after the blast. Lois Lane doesn't jump to conclusions, she gets to the bottom of the crime. Lex Luthor apparently had a coherent plan - everything is explained pretty well. Wonder Woman was already good, so there's no change there :) Also, the \"Martha\" scene seems better executed, because it is a few seconds longer, and there's time to breathe it in. So, here's my take on this movie - The theatrical cut was junk. Get the Bluray for ultimate edition, and you shall not be disappointed. I've seen it so many more times now, and it's the definitive cut. It is the movie we deserve. It's a unique take on Batman, and Superman. It's a gritty take on the superhero movie genre, and definitely the best DCEU movie, and the best DC movie since The Dark Knight.P.S. Yes it's dark. We're adults, and we should appreciate mature film making without intentionally silly moments. It attempts to be philosophical, and something deep instead of just trying to make you chuckle."

"This is one of the best superhero movies ever made. Zack Snyder is a magician behind the camera.The reason behind so many complaints is the fact that Warner Bros. marketed this movie as a fight between Batman and Superman. That's not what it is. It's a movie about the origins of the Justice League.The cinematography, the acting and the score are all second to none. This film is phenomenal.P.S: watch the 3 hour extended cut that Snyder intended you to see, not the 2 and a half hour movie that Warner Bros. decided would be better for theaters."

"I don't care what the critics say, this is a very well-done movie. I'll start my review by listing what I like about the movie.1.) Ben Affleck is the best batman to me and it is not close. He pulls off the role of an aging batman extremely well. Also, Zack Snyder's vision of batman is legit. I have always hated batman up until this adaptation of him. Instead of being a conflicted and idealistic batman, this batman is dark, gritty, and 100% a badass. His equipment is decked out with machine guns and he has no aversion to killing people. In fact, he probably kills about 50 criminal by the time this movie is over. The warehouse scene is the coolest batman scene in any movie.2.) The development of a grudge between batman and superman is pulled off flawlessly. It actually makes sense why batman dislikes superman. Then, when they do fight it is about the coolest thing you can expect to see from a superhero film. 3.) I disagree with a lot of people about Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor. In my opinion, he played his role to perfection. 4.) B v S sets up Wonder Woman and Justice League with Gal Gadot's cameo as Wonder Woman and short clips of Aquaman, the Flash, and Cyborg. B v S is one of my favorite superhero films and rewatching it never gets old."

"The theatrical cut of this film is garbage which is why I rated it eight stars instead of nine. The first time I watched this film I didn't like it (not straight out hate but didn't like). Character motivations didn't make any sense, Lex was annoying as s***, editing was sloppy, and it was overly dark and broody for an action superhero movie. A year + a half, five Marvel films, a ton of bad reviews and a Justice League later a thought popped into my head: \"what if I watched BVS again\". This time I didn't have trailers ruining the best moments, I only vaguely remembered the film, and I was conditioned to look at it negatively but something unexpected happened: I actually loved it. Superman was just a normal person that tried to make a difference cause he could that others imposed their own beliefs on. Lex Luthor was a genius that couldn't stand his powerlessness compared to Superman or more accurately a super being. As Alfred said \"The fever, the rage, the feeling of powerlessness that turns good men... cruel\" and you see the same thought process in Batman. Batman, just like Lex Luthor feels powerless in the midst of a god-being and just like Lex he attempts to destroy him so he can get his sense of power back but unlike Lex, Batman learns something. I what is one of the corniest lines of the movie Superman says, \"Martha\" when he knows he can't win against Batman in a late desperate attempt to save his mother. Not only does this name connect with Bruce Wayne but it also shows what really matters to a man of steel: it isn't power, it isn't fame or anything else, it is his Mother and on a broader scale it is people. Lex (who doesn't care about people at all) knows he doesn't have the power so he creates something from his blood and the remains of Zod: A Doomsday for Superman. Not only does this film have depth but it also doesn't always explain it to you which is rare in a blockbuster action superhero flick normally cater to semi-comic book fans and people that want to shove popcorn in their mouths. This film rewards you for really noticing the details while still having massive explosions. One of my favorites is how Lex has all of Batman's branded killed which is why he isn't afraid of the branding at the end or Grandma's Peach Tea as a way of scaring the s*** out of someone. Of course, this film isn't perfect and I do have personal dislikes. The Batman V Superman fight was slow and pretty boring especially after watching such an amazing fight in Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 2 (If you haven't watched the animated Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 1 and 2 you are sorely missing out on something fantastic). Also, the addition of Wonder Woman who pretty much steals a hacker thing, gives it back and then suits up and fights against a giant monster thing. Not to say I don't like Wonder Woman (She is one of my favorite Superheroes of all time who showed not only can woman kick a** but they also don't need to be ashamed of their sexuality or gender) but she wasn't really that helpful to the plot and just brought in to expand the universe which was well done through Lex's superhuman hunting files. Also, the post-apocalyptic scene that was just a dream could have been cut but nothing is perfect except movies like Citizen Kane which isn't a lot of fun to watch cause it is too perfect. So to summarize, the theatrical cut is bad, the ultimate cut is Amazing and the other cut is meh. Please give it a second chance because it deserves it and save a good director from losing grace because of something he didn't do."
"I really liked it, don't know what all the hate is about. I'm actually a Marvel fan from when I was 7 or so, but Superman and Batman together in 1 movie? Just great. And personally I like Ben Affleck even better than Christian Bale as Batman. So just watch and enjoy, I know I did!"

"That's right. We have been waiting for these two heroes to finally meet and fight against each other. This movie is so good in both plot and special effects.Henry Cavill and Ben Affleck have performed well in their acting stages. They are the best superhero actors and they have filmed their fighting scenes very well. The movie starts to show the conflict between the lives of the heroes and now they have blamed each other for it. This movie is amazing and sets up a good plot for Dawn Justice."

"Actually...I didn't know what to expect. When you see Wonder Woman, you know it will be off of Wonder Woman and off of a Wonder Woman story, but with Batman V Superman, I was like, \"hmmmm, so who is this about?\" It was pretty obvious that it would feature many characters, but I thought the introduction to Batman was amazing. Ben Affleck nailed the part, not only as Batman but also as Bruce Wayne. He is my Batman. Henry Cavill continued to be super as the Man of Steel. And he is my Super - Man. A dark story? Yes, without a doubt. Could it have had a few more jokes? Sure. But not all movies or stories need to have jokes when certain events are serious. I really hope people can see this review and take another look at the movie, because, I loved it. I really hope the ratings can go up, eventually. And P.S, this movie is the perfect set up to Justice League."

"I'll start by making it clear I have only ever seen the Ultimate Edition. I'm aware of what was cut out for the theatrical release, so I will concede up front that most of the criticisms about pacing, editing, and missing bits of plot at release were merited.With that caveat out of the way, I must reiterate that this was bar-none the boldest superhero movie I have ever seen. To me, it was arguably the best as well, though \"best\" shouldn't be taken to mean \"most enjoyable.\" That honor easily goes to \"Thor: Ragnarok.\" What makes BvS stand out among other films in the genre is that it takes two characters who have been done to death since the 1970s and brings them up to date. I recently tried to watch \"Superman: The Movie\" for the first time in a number of years, and while it was still good and Reeves will always be iconic, I just couldn't take it seriously. I'll put it this way: If the story in BvS was \"stupid\" in your view but Superman turning back time by spinning the earth backward on its axis didn't seem like one of the dumbest things you have ever seen -in any movie from any genre- to the extent that it outright ruins the movie for you, then your opinion about BvS isn't worth much. Nostalgic bias was always going to be a problem for this movie, and the way people reacted to and reviewed \"Man of Steel\" was telling in this regard.That brings me to Zack Snyder's take on Superman. You know, that guy whose status as the first extraterrestrial ever encountered by humanity was a total non-issue in the old movies. Apparently, Snyder has a similar view to my own in that his take on the Man of Steel makes his being an alien a core piece of his identity. He may look like any other (absurdly attractive) person, but he knows what he is, and that makes him perpetually uncertain of where he fits in this world. He is essentially good and really does care about people, but he struggles to truly empathize with the likes of us. To be human is to be frail, and that is not something he can easily relate to. This is the root of his conflict with Batman.Just as Clark struggles to genuinely relate to most people, Snyder's Batman either refuses to or otherwise just can't relate to Superman. He doesn't see him as anything but a threat regardless of Superman's clear good intentions. Remember, a small group of Kryptonians were able to bring humanity to the brink of extinction in less than a day, and Bruce Wayne is nothing if not a realist. He didn't know the guy from Kansas. He only knew the god from another world.While Batman's anger toward and fear of Superman are readily apparent from the start, Superman's inability to imagine things from Bruce Wayne's perspective only becomes truly apparent during their first real interaction. This reminded me of the animated version of the \"world's finest\" storyline, where Superman judges Batman harshly for using fear tactics and threats of violence (also, actual violence) to get the job done. Superman wasn't willing to consider what it would take for a human man to fight criminals and save innocents, or what that life would do to him over time. Just as Batman didn't see the guy from Kansas, Superman didn't see the man who lives his life trapped in one brutal, unthinkably traumatic moment (this was beautifully conveyed during the film's opening moments), and had spent his whole adult life bearing witness to humanity at its absolute worst.The conflict between these two characters is as old as human history. They want the same things, but they can't understand one another. So they fight. And what a fight it was.Watching a fight between, say, Captain America and Iron Man was, to me, more frustrating than anything because each understood the other's perspective perfectly. The fight between Batman and Superman in BvS was genuinely gut-wrenching, as intended, because they would have understood one another if either had tried. The whole sequence hilighted Batman's tactical prowess and ability to control a situation. Maybe the most badass thing about the fight was that it ended exactly where Batman planned. That brings me to the big elephant in the room named \"Martha.\"I can't recall exactly which YouTuber put it this way, but if you thought the \"save Martha\" exchange was about their mothers having the same name, you had your brain turned off. The brain-on people have explained this to death, but it bears repeating. This was the moment when Superman became humanized to Batman. He was about to die, and his only concern was for his adoptive human mother. He still believed that the man about to take his life would do the right thing. Even with the cowl on, there was no mistaking the look on Batman's face. It was the look of shame, guilt, and sudden uncertainty that says \"What am I doing?\" Turns out even the most brutal, angry version of Bruce Wayne is better than Tony Stark at knowing right from wrong. At knowing that he had gone too far.From there, the third act was a series of truly impressive (albeit mostly CGI) fight sequences, beginning with what I regard as the undisputed champion of Batman fights. Nothing in the Nolan movies (and especially nothing in the Burton movies) even came close. Go ahead, try to convince yourself that Batman and Bane taking turns punching one another in the face until Bane's mask broke was a good fight sequence. No, this was a fight straight out of \"Arkham Knight,\" and it was glorious. The battle against Doomsday really was one for the books. From the moment Wonder Woman arrived accompanied by the intense sounds of Tina Guo's electric cello to Superman's tragic, heroic death at the hands of Doomsday, I was glued to the screen. Sure, the mere presence of Doomsday spoiled the end to a degree, but watching the Man of Steel laboring to carry that kryptonite spear towards certain death was no less impactful. A brief word on Jesse Eisenberg's take on Lex Luthor. At least one other reviewer on this site already said it best when they pointed out that this was his origin story. If you consider his scheme objectively, he is actually one of the more formidable incarnations of the character. If we're lucky, we'll eventually get to see a Snyder Cut of \"Justice League\" and find out where this story was actually meant to go. For the record, Joss Whedon and Danny Elfman both should have said \"no\" to taking a dump on someone else's art."
"BATMAN V SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE brings a fantastic surprise to a smash-hit team-up with one of the worlds most beloved DC Comics' icons of all time. The movie delivers spectacular casting, and fantastic acting with different characters having their shine in each scenes.The story follows Clark Kent/Superman who becomes a threat, after the destruction in Metropolis in Man Of Steel.(2013). Batman/Bruce Wayne sees him as a threat and begins his war on Superman.The movie brings spectacular storytelling, it tells the complications of human against alien who are on the same side, and the first meeting of Batman and Superman. The story of Bruce Wayne, with his many years of The Caped Crusader, sends him on a spiral of \"out of control\", sheer anger, and builds tension to wanting to defeat the Man of Steel. Snyder has fantastically gave this storytelling an exciting nod to the comics.Lex Luthor, played by Jesse Einsberg, delivers a very interesting performance, but very differently by him showing is his \"origin\" before he becomes a bald foe to the Man of Steel. He shows that his love of \"god vs man\" terrorises mankind when he ultimately creates Doomsday, and Batman realises Superman's inner heroism.It packs so many great \"out of nowhere\" excitement, including a first-look of the fearful Wonder Woman a.k.a. Diana Prince, played by Gal Gadot, and a fresh-new glimpse of the superhero DC canon: The Justice League.WATCH THIS MOVIE! The critics are out of their mind. It's a fun-packed action adventure which still keeps the movie enjoyable until it's final minutes of the movie. It's a FANTASTIC MOVIE! BEN AFFLECK AS BATMAN... is Incredible!A 10/10 overall!"
"I want to go on record as saying that this is a truly thrilling cinematic experience in so many ways. If pressed, I guess I could acknowledge that there were a couple ... let's say \"clumsy\" moments. And in a film that runs to three hours, that hardly seems like a significant issue, certainly not enough to rate it with fewer than 9 stars.This film has everything. There is dramatic tension right from the start. There is a magnificent story arc that picks up quite seamlessly from 'Man of Steel' and propels the viewer not only into the life of Clark Kent/Superman but also of Bruce Wayne/Batman.The villain is no mere cartoon of a villain; he is truly thoroughly (and apparently irrevocably) diabolical. He is a psychopath, and you wish for his death over and over and over. You want Superman to reduce him to ash with the power of his eyes.I have read a number of viewers' reviews, and it seems that the people who disliked the film / gave it a low rating had rather unfair and unrealistic expectations of it. That is, their own prejudices about how the plot could/should unfold or what the character development could/should be, etc. ruined the film for them. And that is a shame.My thought is: I settle into my seat, wait for the lights to dim, and then I wait to be transported by the film. I accept it, lock, stock, and barrel.As another reviewer remarked, I love how the film begins from the point of view of Bruce Wayne as he is among people on the ground who have fallen victim to the attack of Zod and the other Kryptonians.Why would Bruce Wayne not like Superman? Why would the good people of Earth hurl insults at Superman and burn him in effigy (on the news)? Because the good people of Earth just got catapulted into a new reality in which there are not only extraterrestrial beings (surprise!) but they are also superman! And a group of them are hell-bent on destroying humankind and taking the planet for themselves.It is difficult to see Superman as separate from the whole Kryptonian Krew.It seems that many moviegoers forgot that Bruce Wayne is also human. Sure, he's a hero, but he is flawed.. Just like the rest of us. He is a vigilante, after all.He has let his vigilantism get the better of him. HE is actually the one working outside the boundaries of the law, not Superman. It is the clear head of Alfred that shows us that he has gone into a rather dark place, that he has not seen what is really going on (in Luthor's scheme), and so he chooses to embark on his own scheme scheme to take out the alien invader. He is (allegedly) thinking of the future: if he wipes out the all-powerful alien, then it can't turn on humankind in the future. At least, he convinces himself of that.A philosophical question is raised in the film: should Clark Kent have remained a simple man from Kansas and never have become the Superman? Should he just let people die and let calamities happen? The question is answered for us in the character of Diana Prince/Wonder Woman. She withdrew from mankind (her exact words) and just sat around watching. Watching while people died horrible deaths all around her. So, should Superman have done the same? Do these special beings, these 'metahumans', have some kind of moral imperative to intervene, or should they be allowed to be regular people, too? It seems that humans want it both ways.It seems that humans are saying: \"Don't be a superalien ... except when I and my friends and family are in trouble. Then come save us.\""

"Batman v Superman: Ultimate Edition: If your looking for a quick, cheap thrill then you might not enjoy this film at the time. This movies theatrical version was butchered by WB and in doing so reshaped the story leaving numerous plot holes. So the Ultimate Edition is the full story and the one worth seeing. Watch 'Man of Steel' before seeing this movie. There is much to claw through here, so much so that the audience might easily find themselves exhausted from the overall aggression of the film. However, a lot of the story does work. The action is good, and the emotion feels real most of the time.This film is about Superman trying to become Superman. Trying to help the world, save people, find a place in this world not as an outcast, and yet is looked at has a threat by many. Superman is not from this world, yet He is trying to be human, find a place in this world, be excepted by earths people, and come into his destiny.This film is also about Batman being Batman for 20 years and losing faith in humanity, and fearing Superman, what Superman can do with his powers. Great film, great plot, great visuals. ---Yidioo"
"I didn't see the film in the theaters and just bought the \"Extended Edition \" on Amazon. I never properly saw Man of Steel- i think I rented it and watched it when already exhausted and fell asleep. I saw the mediocre user reviews and horrible reviews from critics of this film.They really have it wrong. This is the very best either Batman or Superman. It has a different take, on things. Much darker then earlier films even darker then the Christopher Nolan Batman films.First of all Christopher Nolan is an Executive Producer. So how bad could it be? I loved Sucker Punch and Zack Snyder was involved with that. So how bad could this be? Hans Zimmer did the music, so how bad could it be?I remember watching the old Superman TV shows and reading the Superman and Batman comics as a little kid and loved them, but i wouldn't call myself a \"fan boy\" of comic universes, like so many younger people today. As an older adult I will admit my favorite TV show of all time was Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but watched it on DVD only after it had finished. I saw the second of the Dark Knight series in the theater, but the other two, I watched on DVD. They were great, but not my favorite films like so many people. i also loved the first couple Superman and Batman films in the older series. Regardless, i was not waiting with baited breath to see Man of Steel or this one.I'm more of a serious film fan, who can watch Stanley Kubrick films over and over and my favorite films in the last twenty years, are Eyes Wide Shut and Intersteller, both of which i've watched multiple times.So, with that said, take it from me, the critics have this film very wrong, just as critics hated 2001: A Space Odyssey when it first came out. This film will have lasting appreciation.Surprised how much I liked Ben Afleck's Batman. it was hard to get into Henry Cavil's scrawnier looking Superman, but it grew on me. Amy Adams was great as Lois Lane, The Gal Gadol Wonder Women was amazing. Lex Luther was terrific, like Nolan's Joker. Jeremy Irons was the best Alfred ever. Holly Hunter and Diane Lane was good too. The movie had bad reviews but made a billion dollars. Hopefully everyone buys the Ultimate Edition and it breaks sales records and the film is re-appreciated. I have no idea what scenes this Ultimate Edition added, but it is pretty perfect. Now I can't wait for Wonder Woman and the Justice League and as soon as I finish writing this am going to watch Man of Steal. I'm into it now!I can only surmise that the bad reviews stem from too much expectations of the rigid fan boy types and the radical changes in tone, we see in this film.Total masterpiece of cinema, but I have a few criticisms. There are a few hollow scenes of typical Idiot cops and authorities getting everything wrong in a cliché type way and it has a few filler scenes of that type and a few moments here and there that felt rushed and cheesy. Maybe not everything restored into the Ultimate Edition should have been. I wish there had been more Kevin Costner scenes."

"The whole entire Batman V Superman movie was great and yes even though it felt slow to the majority of the people who watched it but to me I enjoyed every part and every scene of Batman V Superman and when it got to the fight scenes both batman VS Superman and the Doomsday fight it brought so much drama, intensity, and epic performances. So with that being said I give this movie a good 10/10 because it really did go to my expectations and it brought a powerful performance and a powerful yet epic introduction to the upcoming Justice League."

"Zack Snyder not only understands the characters but he also understands how to craft a real amazing movie for fans - honestly blew me away (extended cut) Brilliant!Don't believe what the internet is telling you to think - take this from a person who has worked in the comic book industry - this is amazing!"

"When I first wrote a review for this movie a year ago exclaiming my excitement for the film, I had been high off a fresh dose of live-action DC superheroes playing out the beloved comic book stories that I had grown up on. It was all playing out before my eyes and coming to life. After a few months had passed, I began to notice things about the movie that I disliked: little gaps in the story, things that didn't add up, etc. My original rating of a 10 / 10 dropped to an 8 /10. But today it has gone back up to a 10. The extended version of the film not only rectifies the gaps but also silences critics.Many claimed that the movie was too dark or that it just didn't make sense. To those people, I say: \"Pick up a comic book!\" Many of the critics of this particular film were part of the superhero bandwagon that formed when Marvel began its spree of Avengers-related films. In fact, its estimated that over 60% of people who go to see 'superhero' genre films have never picked up a comic book in their life. I would argue that similar numbers could figure to those which view the CW televised DC Universe shows. People complain that DC comics is just too dark but the fact is that these movies are based upon actual comics which are meant to be dark (ex: The Dark Knight Returns, Injustice, etc.). Its like complaining that Game of Thrones (the TV series) sucks because they kill off too many characters. Read the books! Its frustrating to see such a beautiful work of art like Batman V Superman criticized by those ignorant to its universe and its meaning. This movie is in fact a catalyst that opens numerous doorways and leaves true fans in awe of the possibilities for future movies. But regardless of whether or not people choose to educate themselves, this film's DVD/Blu-ray extended version puts the theater release to shame. All of the plot holes and gaps are filled in 30 minutes of extended footage scattered throughout the film. The movie ultimately becomes more complete and people will wish that the movie had shown the full 3 hours of footage in its theatrical debut. As a major DC comics fan, I will of course pick up on things that a comics fan would not, but someone who does not read comics would learn to appreciate this film in its entirety with the extended version. Get your hands on a copy today or find it on Netflix or the internet somewhere!"

"I ignored the bad reviews and watched anyways. This film had a lot to live up to after Civil War was released and I went into this film expecting the worst. It ended up to be the best Superhero film of 2016 to me. One complaint was that this film was more concerned about universe building than telling a great story than Civil War but for me it was the other way around; Civil War felt like a build up to something else and to be honest, I felt that way when I saw the other MCU films. Batman vs Superman however not only had a great story, but it also felt a lot more consistent than Civil War. This film was way more diverse with the cast than the MCU but unlike the MCU, I felt like this film doesn't go overboard with the SJW stuff like the MCU films or The Star Wars Sequel films do. The Visuals were AMAZING, The Score by Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL was AMAZING as well, The Tone is just right as I actually felt for the characters emotionally, The Cinematography kept my eyes glued to the screen, and the script felt really Intelligent and Complex and despite people calling the writing confusing, I was able to piece it together with no problem whatsoever. This film is similar to Empire Strikes back in terms of popularity so over time after the other movies are released, this movie would probably be more popular.This film was way better than I Expected and deserves another chance.

"Its shame to see what critics and marvel fans did to this movie and targeted Zack Snyder for it. I have seen this movie more than 25 times till date. And i enjoy this movie as much as i enjoyed the first time. The fans who have read DC comics, wouldn't be disappointed in this movie. Its dark movie, yes it is. Because the title shows the intense situation at hand. Two superheroes about to rip each other apart for whatever reasons that brought them to this stage. Yes it had to be dark and intense.Only marvel can be stupid enough to show an alien invasion where humans are loosing the battle and the super heroes are cracking jokes while battles as if they are playing ping pong. a person playing Call of Duty game is more serious while playing than the marvel heroes fighting aliens."

"Last week some news came out from somebody online who had claimed to have seen a finished version of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. If you were like me, you've been leery of checking it out because you weren't sure how much might actually be true. Now Zack Snyder has spoken out about the spoiler-filled post, although his response doesn't really clear anything up.In a word, to MTV, he called the post \"hilarious,which might imply that he's saying that it's mostly, if not entirely, untrue. That might be the case, but then again he could have just said it was untrue and he didn't say that. What he did say, however, is that he doesn't like spoilers. While this may seem odd for the director who's most recent trailer appeared to give away the entire movie, Snyder says that's not the case. Even if you've seen the trailer, you can rest easy, as there is much more we have not seen in then finished film. Says Snyder I have the benefit of seeing the movie. It's cool that think it's too much, and I appreciate people not wanting to know, but there's plenty that they don't know. There's a lot of movie that's not in the trailer. In the process of calling the Batman v Superman Reddit review hilarious, Snyder goes on to talk about how he hates it when spoilers come out. The director would much rather that fans see the movie mostly blind. While he understands that some fans may wish to find the answers before hand, he wants his movies to be mysteries going in. If you're, as an audience member, exploring these articles, looking for answers to questions that you have, maybe you're okay with knowing before you go. It's like an individual taste. But like I said, I want people to see the movie without knowing.Spoilers are a topic that mean different things to different people. While most try to avoid them to some degree, the need to solve the mystery is a nearly universal human experience. We have an inclination to want to know the truth, even while also wanting to be surprised. For most of us getting some information is good, but getting all the information is bad, of course, only getting the details that you want can be difficult."
"The theatrical is choppy, poorly edited, hard to follow, with some really good moments mixed in their. The extended is much more fluent and is much easier to follow, it does have a long runtime, which might make it seem a bit dragging on, but if you like long films done right, like Lord of the Rings, you will like this movie as long as you get into the characters and story. Speaking of which, the story starts out perfectly showing Bruce Wayne as a character, and it is very powerful. There are several moments in this movie that are powerful, emotional, and shocking. Characters. Batman is my favorite fictional character of all time, and believe me when I say, Ben Affleck as Batman was perfect, he had the charisma, the anger, and the look of being through some bad stuff Gal Gadot also does perfect as Wonder Woman, but if you want to really see how good she does, go watch the Wonder Woman movie. Henry Call as Superman. I really don't like it when people say Christopher Reeves is better. Don't get me wrong, Reeves does great, but can you imagine him as Superman in this movie? I wouldn't like it. It would be like Adam West playing Batman in The Dark Knight. Henry Cavill does great in this role, I can say everything about him as I said with Ben Affleck. Jesse Eisenberg as Luthor. I thought it was different in a good way. I've heard a criticism for him as being too much like Joker, but is that a bad thing? Joker is my favorite villain, so to see Superman have an enemy that crazy, but still hold the values Luthor needs to be Luthor, I think it is great. The thing I thought this movie was lacking in the first and second acts was humor, at least good humor. If there was more humor, I would've given this movie a ten because it would give a more relaxing feel to the parts that needed it. All in all though, this movie was awesome, it had powerful moments, it was badass, and just plain fun. It had a great story arc and does its job very well."

"*I will be talking about the Ultimate Edition of the film* This was one of the most anticipated CBM of all time. Ever since the arrival and subsequent success of Marvel's The Avengers people have wondered when will DC launch its own cinematic universe, one of the main reasons being the opportunity to finally see titans such as Batman and Superman share the screen together: the ultimate nerd dream. On 2016, the moment finally came for BvS to be released AND.. it performed poorly. Not only did critical reception left a lot to be desired, but fan reactions where surprisingly split after its cinematic debut. People either loved it and called Zack a genius, or hated it and called him a hack. Me, personally, I found myself with middle of the road feelings, for sure, but more leaning towards the negative side with subsequent viewings. The theatrical cut of the film showcased amazing performances, incredible visuals, and action set pieces that seemed like comic book panels come to life, in a good way. However, when it comes to its narrative structure and more technical aspects like editing, the film was seriously flawed. More plot holes than Age of Ultron, questionable character decisions, random editing that lacked cohesion and focus, and forced dramatic moments that lacked any impact because the attempts at character development ranged from limited to nonexistent, especially when it comes to Superman's character. I thought it was a 5/10 movie at best. As such, I was kind of skeptical about the idea of a 30 minute longer version. I say kind of because I know how Zack works. I remember Watchmen being vastly improved with its director's cut, so in a way I was expecting BvS to perform in a similar manner, but I also feared those 30 minutes wold be just there to amplify action and discredit storytelling issues. Oh boy, I'm so glad I was proved wrong. The ultimate cut of the film was infuriating, but not because it was awful, but because it questions the sanity of WB executives and editors and makes you wonder what were they thinking during the editing process. What I got out of the Ultimate Edition was a thought-provoking deconstruction of two very iconic superheroes that gave spotlight to the struggles both of them face when they aren't fighting crime. What I got was an extremely well produced character study on both Batman and Superman in a cynical world, a world dangerously close to our own. We meet Batman as a ruthless, worn out hero that has seen the failure behind his ideals and witnessed some truly horrifying things in his life. Superman, on the other hand, is portrayed as a godlike figure that seeks to do good in the world, but finds himself emotionally conflicted once he realized that every good deed he does leaves behind a trail of destruction (most of it due to Luthor's antics). In my opinion, this is a hugely original approach, one that distances itself from the rest of the competition and delivers a dark, somber, yet relevant superhero movie that understands both characters and gives them real human struggles to deal with. I felt invested in both of them, and hoped that by the end of the film both could find a way to redeem themselves. Their character arcs were very well established during the first two acts of the movie, and by the time we get to the titular climactic battle the emotion behind the jaw-dropping action is intensified. Lex Luthor as a villain was also given more time to develop with this new edition. One of the main criticisms with the original version was the fact that his plan relied too much on conveniences, and the character's mannerisms and mad-scientist attitude was annoying, and that goes without saying his motivations were unclear. Not only do we spend more time understanding his hate for any godlike figure and thus his hatred for Superman, but the added scenes allowed us to witness his entire plan come to fruition. It sells the cold, manipulative, calculating attributes of his comic counterpart. The acting is spot on. Every actor owns his/her role, from Cavill's Superman, to Ben Affleck as Batman, Eisenberg as Luthor, and Gadot as Wonder Woman, whose scenes are brief, but are more than enough to sell the strong and ferocious warrior that she is. Cinematography is stunning, and miles above that of Man of Steel's. And the soundtrack by Zimmer and Junkie XL? Perfect, just perfect. When it comes to flaws, the film still has some of those. The Martha moment, while serving as a pivotal character moment for Batman, felt off in execution, and its understandable that many people got mad at it. If your main complaint about BvS the first time around was its bleak tone and subject matter, this film is still not for you. I understand most were expecting to see the heroes being the most iconic versions of themselves, clashing in an elongated battle and evoking the same feelings The Avengers gave audiences back in 2012. In that sense, the film will remain divisive, but at least I have the comfort of saying that, at the very least, the film is competently made."

"This film was amazing. Ben Affleck was easily the best part of this movie, he brought his a-game as Batman. The chemistry between Affleck & Irons was outstanding. Gal Gadot did a great job as Wonder Woman. The fight between Batman & Superman was awesome. The final fight with Doomsday was outstanding in every way possible. However, there is only one problem with this film and that's Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor. He was sadly missed cast in this role, but then again it's really the fault of Warner Bros. Studios. Overall, this film deliver on almost every level. I highly recommend that you watch the extended version of this film."

"I know I know. I saw it in theaters too, and felt like it could've been so much better. While the Batman element was good, the narrative felt fractured, and the third act was just one long stunt scene. Superman was relegated to a supporting character, and other characters didn't get a chance to shine. And then I chanced on the ultimate cut. Calling it 30 mins of \"extra\" footage is unfair to Zack Snyder because it's exactly these 30 mins that makes the movie a worthy one. What I can say about the theatrical cut is this - It had the blockbuster elements - music, visuals, stunts, CGI. But, it lacked the human elements. The first 20 mins of the movie had it, but not after that. The extended cut in comparison has a flow to the narrative. There are no disjointed scenes, everything flows smoothly, and there's connective tissue. Superman gets to spend some time with his father, and mother. Clark Kent does some investigative journalism. Superman helps the people after the blast. Lois Lane doesn't jump to conclusions, she gets to the bottom of the crime. Lex Luthor apparently had a coherent plan - everything is explained pretty well. Wonder Woman was already good, so there's no change there :) Also, the \"Martha\" scene seems better executed, because it is a few seconds longer, and there's time to breathe it in. So, here's my take on this movie - The theatrical cut was junk. Get the Bluray for ultimate edition, and you shall not be disappointed. I've seen it so many more times now, and it's the definitive cut. It is the movie we deserve. It's a unique take on Batman, and Superman. It's a gritty take on the superhero movie genre, and definitely the best DCEU movie, and the best DC movie since The Dark Knight.P.S. Yes it's dark. We're adults, and we should appreciate mature film making without intentionally silly moments. It attempts to be philosophical, and something deep instead of just trying to make you chuckle."

"This is one of the best superhero movies ever made. Zack Snyder is a magician behind the camera.The reason behind so many complaints is the fact that Warner Bros. marketed this movie as a fight between Batman and Superman. That's not what it is. It's a movie about the origins of the Justice League.The cinematography, the acting and the score are all second to none. This film is phenomenal.P.S: watch the 3 hour extended cut that Snyder intended you to see, not the 2 and a half hour movie that Warner Bros. decided would be better for theaters."

"I don't care what the critics say, this is a very well-done movie. I'll start my review by listing what I like about the movie.1.) Ben Affleck is the best batman to me and it is not close. He pulls off the role of an aging batman extremely well. Also, Zack Snyder's vision of batman is legit. I have always hated batman up until this adaptation of him. Instead of being a conflicted and idealistic batman, this batman is dark, gritty, and 100% a badass. His equipment is decked out with machine guns and he has no aversion to killing people. In fact, he probably kills about 50 criminal by the time this movie is over. The warehouse scene is the coolest batman scene in any movie.2.) The development of a grudge between batman and superman is pulled off flawlessly. It actually makes sense why batman dislikes superman. Then, when they do fight it is about the coolest thing you can expect to see from a superhero film. 3.) I disagree with a lot of people about Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor. In my opinion, he played his role to perfection. 4.) B v S sets up Wonder Woman and Justice League with Gal Gadot's cameo as Wonder Woman and short clips of Aquaman, the Flash, and Cyborg. B v S is one of my favorite superhero films and rewatching it never gets old."

"The theatrical cut of this film is garbage which is why I rated it eight stars instead of nine. The first time I watched this film I didn't like it (not straight out hate but didn't like). Character motivations didn't make any sense, Lex was annoying as s***, editing was sloppy, and it was overly dark and broody for an action superhero movie. A year + a half, five Marvel films, a ton of bad reviews and a Justice League later a thought popped into my head: \"what if I watched BVS again\". This time I didn't have trailers ruining the best moments, I only vaguely remembered the film, and I was conditioned to look at it negatively but something unexpected happened: I actually loved it. Superman was just a normal person that tried to make a difference cause he could that others imposed their own beliefs on. Lex Luthor was a genius that couldn't stand his powerlessness compared to Superman or more accurately a super being. As Alfred said \"The fever, the rage, the feeling of powerlessness that turns good men... cruel\" and you see the same thought process in Batman. Batman, just like Lex Luthor feels powerless in the midst of a god-being and just like Lex he attempts to destroy him so he can get his sense of power back but unlike Lex, Batman learns something. I what is one of the corniest lines of the movie Superman says, \"Martha\" when he knows he can't win against Batman in a late desperate attempt to save his mother. Not only does this name connect with Bruce Wayne but it also shows what really matters to a man of steel: it isn't power, it isn't fame or anything else, it is his Mother and on a broader scale it is people. Lex (who doesn't care about people at all) knows he doesn't have the power so he creates something from his blood and the remains of Zod: A Doomsday for Superman. Not only does this film have depth but it also doesn't always explain it to you which is rare in a blockbuster action superhero flick normally cater to semi-comic book fans and people that want to shove popcorn in their mouths. This film rewards you for really noticing the details while still having massive explosions. One of my favorites is how Lex has all of Batman's branded killed which is why he isn't afraid of the branding at the end or Grandma's Peach Tea as a way of scaring the s*** out of someone. Of course, this film isn't perfect and I do have personal dislikes. The Batman V Superman fight was slow and pretty boring especially after watching such an amazing fight in Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 2 (If you haven't watched the animated Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 1 and 2 you are sorely missing out on something fantastic). Also, the addition of Wonder Woman who pretty much steals a hacker thing, gives it back and then suits up and fights against a giant monster thing. Not to say I don't like Wonder Woman (She is one of my favorite Superheroes of all time who showed not only can woman kick a** but they also don't need to be ashamed of their sexuality or gender) but she wasn't really that helpful to the plot and just brought in to expand the universe which was well done through Lex's superhuman hunting files. Also, the post-apocalyptic scene that was just a dream could have been cut but nothing is perfect except movies like Citizen Kane which isn't a lot of fun to watch cause it is too perfect. So to summarize, the theatrical cut is bad, the ultimate cut is Amazing and the other cut is meh. Please give it a second chance because it deserves it and save a good director from losing grace because of something he didn't do."
"I really liked it, don't know what all the hate is about. I'm actually a Marvel fan from when I was 7 or so, but Superman and Batman together in 1 movie? Just great. And personally I like Ben Affleck even better than Christian Bale as Batman. So just watch and enjoy, I know I did!"

"That's right. We have been waiting for these two heroes to finally meet and fight against each other. This movie is so good in both plot and special effects.Henry Cavill and Ben Affleck have performed well in their acting stages. They are the best superhero actors and they have filmed their fighting scenes very well. The movie starts to show the conflict between the lives of the heroes and now they have blamed each other for it. This movie is amazing and sets up a good plot for Dawn Justice."

"Actually...I didn't know what to expect. When you see Wonder Woman, you know it will be off of Wonder Woman and off of a Wonder Woman story, but with Batman V Superman, I was like, \"hmmmm, so who is this about?\" It was pretty obvious that it would feature many characters, but I thought the introduction to Batman was amazing. Ben Affleck nailed the part, not only as Batman but also as Bruce Wayne. He is my Batman. Henry Cavill continued to be super as the Man of Steel. And he is my Super - Man. A dark story? Yes, without a doubt. Could it have had a few more jokes? Sure. But not all movies or stories need to have jokes when certain events are serious. I really hope people can see this review and take another look at the movie, because, I loved it. I really hope the ratings can go up, eventually. And P.S, this movie is the perfect set up to Justice League."

"I'll start by making it clear I have only ever seen the Ultimate Edition. I'm aware of what was cut out for the theatrical release, so I will concede up front that most of the criticisms about pacing, editing, and missing bits of plot at release were merited.With that caveat out of the way, I must reiterate that this was bar-none the boldest superhero movie I have ever seen. To me, it was arguably the best as well, though \"best\" shouldn't be taken to mean \"most enjoyable.\" That honor easily goes to \"Thor: Ragnarok.\" What makes BvS stand out among other films in the genre is that it takes two characters who have been done to death since the 1970s and brings them up to date. I recently tried to watch \"Superman: The Movie\" for the first time in a number of years, and while it was still good and Reeves will always be iconic, I just couldn't take it seriously. I'll put it this way: If the story in BvS was \"stupid\" in your view but Superman turning back time by spinning the earth backward on its axis didn't seem like one of the dumbest things you have ever seen -in any movie from any genre- to the extent that it outright ruins the movie for you, then your opinion about BvS isn't worth much. Nostalgic bias was always going to be a problem for this movie, and the way people reacted to and reviewed \"Man of Steel\" was telling in this regard.That brings me to Zack Snyder's take on Superman. You know, that guy whose status as the first extraterrestrial ever encountered by humanity was a total non-issue in the old movies. Apparently, Snyder has a similar view to my own in that his take on the Man of Steel makes his being an alien a core piece of his identity. He may look like any other (absurdly attractive) person, but he knows what he is, and that makes him perpetually uncertain of where he fits in this world. He is essentially good and really does care about people, but he struggles to truly empathize with the likes of us. To be human is to be frail, and that is not something he can easily relate to. This is the root of his conflict with Batman.Just as Clark struggles to genuinely relate to most people, Snyder's Batman either refuses to or otherwise just can't relate to Superman. He doesn't see him as anything but a threat regardless of Superman's clear good intentions. Remember, a small group of Kryptonians were able to bring humanity to the brink of extinction in less than a day, and Bruce Wayne is nothing if not a realist. He didn't know the guy from Kansas. He only knew the god from another world.While Batman's anger toward and fear of Superman are readily apparent from the start, Superman's inability to imagine things from Bruce Wayne's perspective only becomes truly apparent during their first real interaction. This reminded me of the animated version of the \"world's finest\" storyline, where Superman judges Batman harshly for using fear tactics and threats of violence (also, actual violence) to get the job done. Superman wasn't willing to consider what it would take for a human man to fight criminals and save innocents, or what that life would do to him over time. Just as Batman didn't see the guy from Kansas, Superman didn't see the man who lives his life trapped in one brutal, unthinkably traumatic moment (this was beautifully conveyed during the film's opening moments), and had spent his whole adult life bearing witness to humanity at its absolute worst.The conflict between these two characters is as old as human history. They want the same things, but they can't understand one another. So they fight. And what a fight it was.Watching a fight between, say, Captain America and Iron Man was, to me, more frustrating than anything because each understood the other's perspective perfectly. The fight between Batman and Superman in BvS was genuinely gut-wrenching, as intended, because they would have understood one another if either had tried. The whole sequence hilighted Batman's tactical prowess and ability to control a situation. Maybe the most badass thing about the fight was that it ended exactly where Batman planned. That brings me to the big elephant in the room named \"Martha.\"I can't recall exactly which YouTuber put it this way, but if you thought the \"save Martha\" exchange was about their mothers having the same name, you had your brain turned off. The brain-on people have explained this to death, but it bears repeating. This was the moment when Superman became humanized to Batman. He was about to die, and his only concern was for his adoptive human mother. He still believed that the man about to take his life would do the right thing. Even with the cowl on, there was no mistaking the look on Batman's face. It was the look of shame, guilt, and sudden uncertainty that says \"What am I doing?\" Turns out even the most brutal, angry version of Bruce Wayne is better than Tony Stark at knowing right from wrong. At knowing that he had gone too far.From there, the third act was a series of truly impressive (albeit mostly CGI) fight sequences, beginning with what I regard as the undisputed champion of Batman fights. Nothing in the Nolan movies (and especially nothing in the Burton movies) even came close. Go ahead, try to convince yourself that Batman and Bane taking turns punching one another in the face until Bane's mask broke was a good fight sequence. No, this was a fight straight out of \"Arkham Knight,\" and it was glorious. The battle against Doomsday really was one for the books. From the moment Wonder Woman arrived accompanied by the intense sounds of Tina Guo's electric cello to Superman's tragic, heroic death at the hands of Doomsday, I was glued to the screen. Sure, the mere presence of Doomsday spoiled the end to a degree, but watching the Man of Steel laboring to carry that kryptonite spear towards certain death was no less impactful. A brief word on Jesse Eisenberg's take on Lex Luthor. At least one other reviewer on this site already said it best when they pointed out that this was his origin story. If you consider his scheme objectively, he is actually one of the more formidable incarnations of the character. If we're lucky, we'll eventually get to see a Snyder Cut of \"Justice League\" and find out where this story was actually meant to go. For the record, Joss Whedon and Danny Elfman both should have said \"no\" to taking a dump on someone else's art."
"BATMAN V SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE brings a fantastic surprise to a smash-hit team-up with one of the worlds most beloved DC Comics' icons of all time. The movie delivers spectacular casting, and fantastic acting with different characters having their shine in each scenes.The story follows Clark Kent/Superman who becomes a threat, after the destruction in Metropolis in Man Of Steel.(2013). Batman/Bruce Wayne sees him as a threat and begins his war on Superman.The movie brings spectacular storytelling, it tells the complications of human against alien who are on the same side, and the first meeting of Batman and Superman. The story of Bruce Wayne, with his many years of The Caped Crusader, sends him on a spiral of \"out of control\", sheer anger, and builds tension to wanting to defeat the Man of Steel. Snyder has fantastically gave this storytelling an exciting nod to the comics.Lex Luthor, played by Jesse Einsberg, delivers a very interesting performance, but very differently by him showing is his \"origin\" before he becomes a bald foe to the Man of Steel. He shows that his love of \"god vs man\" terrorises mankind when he ultimately creates Doomsday, and Batman realises Superman's inner heroism.It packs so many great \"out of nowhere\" excitement, including a first-look of the fearful Wonder Woman a.k.a. Diana Prince, played by Gal Gadot, and a fresh-new glimpse of the superhero DC canon: The Justice League.WATCH THIS MOVIE! The critics are out of their mind. It's a fun-packed action adventure which still keeps the movie enjoyable until it's final minutes of the movie. It's a FANTASTIC MOVIE! BEN AFFLECK AS BATMAN... is Incredible!A 10/10 overall!"
"I want to go on record as saying that this is a truly thrilling cinematic experience in so many ways. If pressed, I guess I could acknowledge that there were a couple ... let's say \"clumsy\" moments. And in a film that runs to three hours, that hardly seems like a significant issue, certainly not enough to rate it with fewer than 9 stars.This film has everything. There is dramatic tension right from the start. There is a magnificent story arc that picks up quite seamlessly from 'Man of Steel' and propels the viewer not only into the life of Clark Kent/Superman but also of Bruce Wayne/Batman.The villain is no mere cartoon of a villain; he is truly thoroughly (and apparently irrevocably) diabolical. He is a psychopath, and you wish for his death over and over and over. You want Superman to reduce him to ash with the power of his eyes.I have read a number of viewers' reviews, and it seems that the people who disliked the film / gave it a low rating had rather unfair and unrealistic expectations of it. That is, their own prejudices about how the plot could/should unfold or what the character development could/should be, etc. ruined the film for them. And that is a shame.My thought is: I settle into my seat, wait for the lights to dim, and then I wait to be transported by the film. I accept it, lock, stock, and barrel.As another reviewer remarked, I love how the film begins from the point of view of Bruce Wayne as he is among people on the ground who have fallen victim to the attack of Zod and the other Kryptonians.Why would Bruce Wayne not like Superman? Why would the good people of Earth hurl insults at Superman and burn him in effigy (on the news)? Because the good people of Earth just got catapulted into a new reality in which there are not only extraterrestrial beings (surprise!) but they are also superman! And a group of them are hell-bent on destroying humankind and taking the planet for themselves.It is difficult to see Superman as separate from the whole Kryptonian Krew.It seems that many moviegoers forgot that Bruce Wayne is also human. Sure, he's a hero, but he is flawed.. Just like the rest of us. He is a vigilante, after all.He has let his vigilantism get the better of him. HE is actually the one working outside the boundaries of the law, not Superman. It is the clear head of Alfred that shows us that he has gone into a rather dark place, that he has not seen what is really going on (in Luthor's scheme), and so he chooses to embark on his own scheme scheme to take out the alien invader. He is (allegedly) thinking of the future: if he wipes out the all-powerful alien, then it can't turn on humankind in the future. At least, he convinces himself of that.A philosophical question is raised in the film: should Clark Kent have remained a simple man from Kansas and never have become the Superman? Should he just let people die and let calamities happen? The question is answered for us in the character of Diana Prince/Wonder Woman. She withdrew from mankind (her exact words) and just sat around watching. Watching while people died horrible deaths all around her. So, should Superman have done the same? Do these special beings, these 'metahumans', have some kind of moral imperative to intervene, or should they be allowed to be regular people, too? It seems that humans want it both ways.It seems that humans are saying: \"Don't be a superalien ... except when I and my friends and family are in trouble. Then come save us.\""

"Batman v Superman: Ultimate Edition: If your looking for a quick, cheap thrill then you might not enjoy this film at the time. This movies theatrical version was butchered by WB and in doing so reshaped the story leaving numerous plot holes. So the Ultimate Edition is the full story and the one worth seeing. Watch 'Man of Steel' before seeing this movie. There is much to claw through here, so much so that the audience might easily find themselves exhausted from the overall aggression of the film. However, a lot of the story does work. The action is good, and the emotion feels real most of the time.This film is about Superman trying to become Superman. Trying to help the world, save people, find a place in this world not as an outcast, and yet is looked at has a threat by many. Superman is not from this world, yet He is trying to be human, find a place in this world, be excepted by earths people, and come into his destiny.This film is also about Batman being Batman for 20 years and losing faith in humanity, and fearing Superman, what Superman can do with his powers. Great film, great plot, great visuals. ---Yidioo"
"I didn't see the film in the theaters and just bought the \"Extended Edition \" on Amazon. I never properly saw Man of Steel- i think I rented it and watched it when already exhausted and fell asleep. I saw the mediocre user reviews and horrible reviews from critics of this film.They really have it wrong. This is the very best either Batman or Superman. It has a different take, on things. Much darker then earlier films even darker then the Christopher Nolan Batman films.First of all Christopher Nolan is an Executive Producer. So how bad could it be? I loved Sucker Punch and Zack Snyder was involved with that. So how bad could this be? Hans Zimmer did the music, so how bad could it be?I remember watching the old Superman TV shows and reading the Superman and Batman comics as a little kid and loved them, but i wouldn't call myself a \"fan boy\" of comic universes, like so many younger people today. As an older adult I will admit my favorite TV show of all time was Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but watched it on DVD only after it had finished. I saw the second of the Dark Knight series in the theater, but the other two, I watched on DVD. They were great, but not my favorite films like so many people. i also loved the first couple Superman and Batman films in the older series. Regardless, i was not waiting with baited breath to see Man of Steel or this one.I'm more of a serious film fan, who can watch Stanley Kubrick films over and over and my favorite films in the last twenty years, are Eyes Wide Shut and Intersteller, both of which i've watched multiple times.So, with that said, take it from me, the critics have this film very wrong, just as critics hated 2001: A Space Odyssey when it first came out. This film will have lasting appreciation.Surprised how much I liked Ben Afleck's Batman. it was hard to get into Henry Cavil's scrawnier looking Superman, but it grew on me. Amy Adams was great as Lois Lane, The Gal Gadol Wonder Women was amazing. Lex Luther was terrific, like Nolan's Joker. Jeremy Irons was the best Alfred ever. Holly Hunter and Diane Lane was good too. The movie had bad reviews but made a billion dollars. Hopefully everyone buys the Ultimate Edition and it breaks sales records and the film is re-appreciated. I have no idea what scenes this Ultimate Edition added, but it is pretty perfect. Now I can't wait for Wonder Woman and the Justice League and as soon as I finish writing this am going to watch Man of Steal. I'm into it now!I can only surmise that the bad reviews stem from too much expectations of the rigid fan boy types and the radical changes in tone, we see in this film.Total masterpiece of cinema, but I have a few criticisms. There are a few hollow scenes of typical Idiot cops and authorities getting everything wrong in a cliché type way and it has a few filler scenes of that type and a few moments here and there that felt rushed and cheesy. Maybe not everything restored into the Ultimate Edition should have been. I wish there had been more Kevin Costner scenes."

"The whole entire Batman V Superman movie was great and yes even though it felt slow to the majority of the people who watched it but to me I enjoyed every part and every scene of Batman V Superman and when it got to the fight scenes both batman VS Superman and the Doomsday fight it brought so much drama, intensity, and epic performances. So with that being said I give this movie a good 10/10 because it really did go to my expectations and it brought a powerful performance and a powerful yet epic introduction to the upcoming Justice League."

"When I first wrote a review for this movie a year ago exclaiming my excitement for the film, I had been high off a fresh dose of live-action DC superheroes playing out the beloved comic book stories that I had grown up on. It was all playing out before my eyes and coming to life. After a few months had passed, I began to notice things about the movie that I disliked: little gaps in the story, things that didn't add up, etc. My original rating of a 10 / 10 dropped to an 8 /10. But today it has gone back up to a 10. The extended version of the film not only rectifies the gaps but also silences critics.Many claimed that the movie was too dark or that it just didn't make sense. To those people, I say: \"Pick up a comic book!\" Many of the critics of this particular film were part of the superhero bandwagon that formed when Marvel began its spree of Avengers-related films. In fact, its estimated that over 60% of people who go to see 'superhero' genre films have never picked up a comic book in their life. I would argue that similar numbers could figure to those which view the CW televised DC Universe shows. People complain that DC comics is just too dark but the fact is that these movies are based upon actual comics which are meant to be dark (ex: The Dark Knight Returns, Injustice, etc.). Its like complaining that Game of Thrones (the TV series) sucks because they kill off too many characters. Read the books! Its frustrating to see such a beautiful work of art like Batman V Superman criticized by those ignorant to its universe and its meaning. This movie is in fact a catalyst that opens numerous doorways and leaves true fans in awe of the possibilities for future movies. But regardless of whether or not people choose to educate themselves, this film's DVD/Blu-ray extended version puts the theater release to shame. All of the plot holes and gaps are filled in 30 minutes of extended footage scattered throughout the film. The movie ultimately becomes more complete and people will wish that the movie had shown the full 3 hours of footage in its theatrical debut. As a major DC comics fan, I will of course pick up on things that a comics fan would not, but someone who does not read comics would learn to appreciate this film in its entirety with the extended version. Get your hands on a copy today or find it on Netflix or the internet somewhere!"

"I ignored the bad reviews and watched anyways. This film had a lot to live up to after Civil War was released and I went into this film expecting the worst. It ended up to be the best Superhero film of 2016 to me. One complaint was that this film was more concerned about universe building than telling a great story than Civil War but for me it was the other way around; Civil War felt like a build up to something else and to be honest, I felt that way when I saw the other MCU films. Batman vs Superman however not only had a great story, but it also felt a lot more consistent than Civil War. This film was way more diverse with the cast than the MCU but unlike the MCU, I felt like this film doesn't go overboard with the SJW stuff like the MCU films or The Star Wars Sequel films do. The Visuals were AMAZING, The Score by Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL was AMAZING as well, The Tone is just right as I actually felt for the characters emotionally, The Cinematography kept my eyes glued to the screen, and the script felt really Intelligent and Complex and despite people calling the writing confusing, I was able to piece it together with no problem whatsoever. This film is similar to Empire Strikes back in terms of popularity so over time after the other movies are released, this movie would probably be more popular.This film was way better than I Expected and deserves another chance.

"Its shame to see what critics and marvel fans did to this movie and targeted Zack Snyder for it. I have seen this movie more than 25 times till date. And i enjoy this movie as much as i enjoyed the first time. The fans who have read DC comics, wouldn't be disappointed in this movie. Its dark movie, yes it is. Because the title shows the intense situation at hand. Two superheroes about to rip each other apart for whatever reasons that brought them to this stage. Yes it had to be dark and intense.Only marvel can be stupid enough to show an alien invasion where humans are loosing the battle and the super heroes are cracking jokes while battles as if they are playing ping pong. a person playing Call of Duty game is more serious while playing than the marvel heroes fighting aliens."

"Last week some news came out from somebody online who had claimed to have seen a finished version of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. If you were like me, you've been leery of checking it out because you weren't sure how much might actually be true. Now Zack Snyder has spoken out about the spoiler-filled post, although his response doesn't really clear anything up.In a word, to MTV, he called the post \"hilarious,which might imply that he's saying that it's mostly, if not entirely, untrue. That might be the case, but then again he could have just said it was untrue and he didn't say that. What he did say, however, is that he doesn't like spoilers. While this may seem odd for the director who's most recent trailer appeared to give away the entire movie, Snyder says that's not the case. Even if you've seen the trailer, you can rest easy, as there is much more we have not seen in then finished film. Says Snyder I have the benefit of seeing the movie. It's cool that think it's too much, and I appreciate people not wanting to know, but there's plenty that they don't know. There's a lot of movie that's not in the trailer. In the process of calling the Batman v Superman Reddit review hilarious, Snyder goes on to talk about how he hates it when spoilers come out. The director would much rather that fans see the movie mostly blind. While he understands that some fans may wish to find the answers before hand, he wants his movies to be mysteries going in. If you're, as an audience member, exploring these articles, looking for answers to questions that you have, maybe you're okay with knowing before you go. It's like an individual taste. But like I said, I want people to see the movie without knowing.Spoilers are a topic that mean different things to different people. While most try to avoid them to some degree, the need to solve the mystery is a nearly universal human experience. We have an inclination to want to know the truth, even while also wanting to be surprised. For most of us getting some information is good, but getting all the information is bad, of course, only getting the details that you want can be difficult."
"The theatrical is choppy, poorly edited, hard to follow, with some really good moments mixed in their. The extended is much more fluent and is much easier to follow, it does have a long runtime, which might make it seem a bit dragging on, but if you like long films done right, like Lord of the Rings, you will like this movie as long as you get into the characters and story. Speaking of which, the story starts out perfectly showing Bruce Wayne as a character, and it is very powerful. There are several moments in this movie that are powerful, emotional, and shocking. Characters. Batman is my favorite fictional character of all time, and believe me when I say, Ben Affleck as Batman was perfect, he had the charisma, the anger, and the look of being through some bad stuff Gal Gadot also does perfect as Wonder Woman, but if you want to really see how good she does, go watch the Wonder Woman movie. Henry Call as Superman. I really don't like it when people say Christopher Reeves is better. Don't get me wrong, Reeves does great, but can you imagine him as Superman in this movie? I wouldn't like it. It would be like Adam West playing Batman in The Dark Knight. Henry Cavill does great in this role, I can say everything about him as I said with Ben Affleck. Jesse Eisenberg as Luthor. I thought it was different in a good way. I've heard a criticism for him as being too much like Joker, but is that a bad thing? Joker is my favorite villain, so to see Superman have an enemy that crazy, but still hold the values Luthor needs to be Luthor, I think it is great. The thing I thought this movie was lacking in the first and second acts was humor, at least good humor. If there was more humor, I would've given this movie a ten because it would give a more relaxing feel to the parts that needed it. All in all though, this movie was awesome, it had powerful moments, it was badass, and just plain fun. It had a great story arc and does its job very well."

"*I will be talking about the Ultimate Edition of the film* This was one of the most anticipated CBM of all time. Ever since the arrival and subsequent success of Marvel's The Avengers people have wondered when will DC launch its own cinematic universe, one of the main reasons being the opportunity to finally see titans such as Batman and Superman share the screen together: the ultimate nerd dream. On 2016, the moment finally came for BvS to be released AND.. it performed poorly. Not only did critical reception left a lot to be desired, but fan reactions where surprisingly split after its cinematic debut. People either loved it and called Zack a genius, or hated it and called him a hack. Me, personally, I found myself with middle of the road feelings, for sure, but more leaning towards the negative side with subsequent viewings. The theatrical cut of the film showcased amazing performances, incredible visuals, and action set pieces that seemed like comic book panels come to life, in a good way. However, when it comes to its narrative structure and more technical aspects like editing, the film was seriously flawed. More plot holes than Age of Ultron, questionable character decisions, random editing that lacked cohesion and focus, and forced dramatic moments that lacked any impact because the attempts at character development ranged from limited to nonexistent, especially when it comes to Superman's character. I thought it was a 5/10 movie at best. As such, I was kind of skeptical about the idea of a 30 minute longer version. I say kind of because I know how Zack works. I remember Watchmen being vastly improved with its director's cut, so in a way I was expecting BvS to perform in a similar manner, but I also feared those 30 minutes wold be just there to amplify action and discredit storytelling issues. Oh boy, I'm so glad I was proved wrong. The ultimate cut of the film was infuriating, but not because it was awful, but because it questions the sanity of WB executives and editors and makes you wonder what were they thinking during the editing process. What I got out of the Ultimate Edition was a thought-provoking deconstruction of two very iconic superheroes that gave spotlight to the struggles both of them face when they aren't fighting crime. What I got was an extremely well produced character study on both Batman and Superman in a cynical world, a world dangerously close to our own. We meet Batman as a ruthless, worn out hero that has seen the failure behind his ideals and witnessed some truly horrifying things in his life. Superman, on the other hand, is portrayed as a godlike figure that seeks to do good in the world, but finds himself emotionally conflicted once he realized that every good deed he does leaves behind a trail of destruction (most of it due to Luthor's antics). In my opinion, this is a hugely original approach, one that distances itself from the rest of the competition and delivers a dark, somber, yet relevant superhero movie that understands both characters and gives them real human struggles to deal with. I felt invested in both of them, and hoped that by the end of the film both could find a way to redeem themselves. Their character arcs were very well established during the first two acts of the movie, and by the time we get to the titular climactic battle the emotion behind the jaw-dropping action is intensified. Lex Luthor as a villain was also given more time to develop with this new edition. One of the main criticisms with the original version was the fact that his plan relied too much on conveniences, and the character's mannerisms and mad-scientist attitude was annoying, and that goes without saying his motivations were unclear. Not only do we spend more time understanding his hate for any godlike figure and thus his hatred for Superman, but the added scenes allowed us to witness his entire plan come to fruition. It sells the cold, manipulative, calculating attributes of his comic counterpart. The acting is spot on. Every actor owns his/her role, from Cavill's Superman, to Ben Affleck as Batman, Eisenberg as Luthor, and Gadot as Wonder Woman, whose scenes are brief, but are more than enough to sell the strong and ferocious warrior that she is. Cinematography is stunning, and miles above that of Man of Steel's. And the soundtrack by Zimmer and Junkie XL? Perfect, just perfect. When it comes to flaws, the film still has some of those. The Martha moment, while serving as a pivotal character moment for Batman, felt off in execution, and its understandable that many people got mad at it. If your main complaint about BvS the first time around was its bleak tone and subject matter, this film is still not for you. I understand most were expecting to see the heroes being the most iconic versions of themselves, clashing in an elongated battle and evoking the same feelings The Avengers gave audiences back in 2012. In that sense, the film will remain divisive, but at least I have the comfort of saying that, at the very least, the film is competently made."

"This film was amazing. Ben Affleck was easily the best part of this movie, he brought his a-game as Batman. The chemistry between Affleck & Irons was outstanding. Gal Gadot did a great job as Wonder Woman. The fight between Batman & Superman was awesome. The final fight with Doomsday was outstanding in every way possible. However, there is only one problem with this film and that's Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor. He was sadly missed cast in this role, but then again it's really the fault of Warner Bros. Studios. Overall, this film deliver on almost every level. I highly recommend that you watch the extended version of this film."

"I know I know. I saw it in theaters too, and felt like it could've been so much better. While the Batman element was good, the narrative felt fractured, and the third act was just one long stunt scene. Superman was relegated to a supporting character, and other characters didn't get a chance to shine. And then I chanced on the ultimate cut. Calling it 30 mins of \"extra\" footage is unfair to Zack Snyder because it's exactly these 30 mins that makes the movie a worthy one. What I can say about the theatrical cut is this - It had the blockbuster elements - music, visuals, stunts, CGI. But, it lacked the human elements. The first 20 mins of the movie had it, but not after that. The extended cut in comparison has a flow to the narrative. There are no disjointed scenes, everything flows smoothly, and there's connective tissue. Superman gets to spend some time with his father, and mother. Clark Kent does some investigative journalism. Superman helps the people after the blast. Lois Lane doesn't jump to conclusions, she gets to the bottom of the crime. Lex Luthor apparently had a coherent plan - everything is explained pretty well. Wonder Woman was already good, so there's no change there :) Also, the \"Martha\" scene seems better executed, because it is a few seconds longer, and there's time to breathe it in. So, here's my take on this movie - The theatrical cut was junk. Get the Bluray for ultimate edition, and you shall not be disappointed. I've seen it so many more times now, and it's the definitive cut. It is the movie we deserve. It's a unique take on Batman, and Superman. It's a gritty take on the superhero movie genre, and definitely the best DCEU movie, and the best DC movie since The Dark Knight.P.S. Yes it's dark. We're adults, and we should appreciate mature film making without intentionally silly moments. It attempts to be philosophical, and something deep instead of just trying to make you chuckle."

"This is one of the best superhero movies ever made. Zack Snyder is a magician behind the camera.The reason behind so many complaints is the fact that Warner Bros. marketed this movie as a fight between Batman and Superman. That's not what it is. It's a movie about the origins of the Justice League.The cinematography, the acting and the score are all second to none. This film is phenomenal.P.S: watch the 3 hour extended cut that Snyder intended you to see, not the 2 and a half hour movie that Warner Bros. decided would be better for theaters."

"I don't care what the critics say, this is a very well-done movie. I'll start my review by listing what I like about the movie.1.) Ben Affleck is the best batman to me and it is not close. He pulls off the role of an aging batman extremely well. Also, Zack Snyder's vision of batman is legit. I have always hated batman up until this adaptation of him. Instead of being a conflicted and idealistic batman, this batman is dark, gritty, and 100% a badass. His equipment is decked out with machine guns and he has no aversion to killing people. In fact, he probably kills about 50 criminal by the time this movie is over. The warehouse scene is the coolest batman scene in any movie.2.) The development of a grudge between batman and superman is pulled off flawlessly. It actually makes sense why batman dislikes superman. Then, when they do fight it is about the coolest thing you can expect to see from a superhero film. 3.) I disagree with a lot of people about Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor. In my opinion, he played his role to perfection. 4.) B v S sets up Wonder Woman and Justice League with Gal Gadot's cameo as Wonder Woman and short clips of Aquaman, the Flash, and Cyborg. B v S is one of my favorite superhero films and rewatching it never gets old."

"The theatrical cut of this film is garbage which is why I rated it eight stars instead of nine. The first time I watched this film I didn't like it (not straight out hate but didn't like). Character motivations didn't make any sense, Lex was annoying as s***, editing was sloppy, and it was overly dark and broody for an action superhero movie. A year + a half, five Marvel films, a ton of bad reviews and a Justice League later a thought popped into my head: \"what if I watched BVS again\". This time I didn't have trailers ruining the best moments, I only vaguely remembered the film, and I was conditioned to look at it negatively but something unexpected happened: I actually loved it. Superman was just a normal person that tried to make a difference cause he could that others imposed their own beliefs on. Lex Luthor was a genius that couldn't stand his powerlessness compared to Superman or more accurately a super being. As Alfred said \"The fever, the rage, the feeling of powerlessness that turns good men... cruel\" and you see the same thought process in Batman. Batman, just like Lex Luthor feels powerless in the midst of a god-being and just like Lex he attempts to destroy him so he can get his sense of power back but unlike Lex, Batman learns something. I what is one of the corniest lines of the movie Superman says, \"Martha\" when he knows he can't win against Batman in a late desperate attempt to save his mother. Not only does this name connect with Bruce Wayne but it also shows what really matters to a man of steel: it isn't power, it isn't fame or anything else, it is his Mother and on a broader scale it is people. Lex (who doesn't care about people at all) knows he doesn't have the power so he creates something from his blood and the remains of Zod: A Doomsday for Superman. Not only does this film have depth but it also doesn't always explain it to you which is rare in a blockbuster action superhero flick normally cater to semi-comic book fans and people that want to shove popcorn in their mouths. This film rewards you for really noticing the details while still having massive explosions. One of my favorites is how Lex has all of Batman's branded killed which is why he isn't afraid of the branding at the end or Grandma's Peach Tea as a way of scaring the s*** out of someone. Of course, this film isn't perfect and I do have personal dislikes. The Batman V Superman fight was slow and pretty boring especially after watching such an amazing fight in Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 2 (If you haven't watched the animated Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 1 and 2 you are sorely missing out on something fantastic). Also, the addition of Wonder Woman who pretty much steals a hacker thing, gives it back and then suits up and fights against a giant monster thing. Not to say I don't like Wonder Woman (She is one of my favorite Superheroes of all time who showed not only can woman kick a** but they also don't need to be ashamed of their sexuality or gender) but she wasn't really that helpful to the plot and just brought in to expand the universe which was well done through Lex's superhuman hunting files. Also, the post-apocalyptic scene that was just a dream could have been cut but nothing is perfect except movies like Citizen Kane which isn't a lot of fun to watch cause it is too perfect. So to summarize, the theatrical cut is bad, the ultimate cut is Amazing and the other cut is meh. Please give it a second chance because it deserves it and save a good director from losing grace because of something he didn't do."
"I really liked it, don't know what all the hate is about. I'm actually a Marvel fan from when I was 7 or so, but Superman and Batman together in 1 movie? Just great. And personally I like Ben Affleck even better than Christian Bale as Batman. So just watch and enjoy, I know I did!"

"That's right. We have been waiting for these two heroes to finally meet and fight against each other. This movie is so good in both plot and special effects.Henry Cavill and Ben Affleck have performed well in their acting stages. They are the best superhero actors and they have filmed their fighting scenes very well. The movie starts to show the conflict between the lives of the heroes and now they have blamed each other for it. This movie is amazing and sets up a good plot for Dawn Justice."

"Actually...I didn't know what to expect. When you see Wonder Woman, you know it will be off of Wonder Woman and off of a Wonder Woman story, but with Batman V Superman, I was like, \"hmmmm, so who is this about?\" It was pretty obvious that it would feature many characters, but I thought the introduction to Batman was amazing. Ben Affleck nailed the part, not only as Batman but also as Bruce Wayne. He is my Batman. Henry Cavill continued to be super as the Man of Steel. And he is my Super - Man. A dark story? Yes, without a doubt. Could it have had a few more jokes? Sure. But not all movies or stories need to have jokes when certain events are serious. I really hope people can see this review and take another look at the movie, because, I loved it. I really hope the ratings can go up, eventually. And P.S, this movie is the perfect set up to Justice League."

"This film is crucial to the extended universe that DC is trying to build, but it feels highly derivative of better stories and continues to demonstrate the misuse of the iconic characters mentioned in the title. Plus Jesse Eisenberg feels wildly mis-casted."

"I'll start by making it clear I have only ever seen the Ultimate Edition. I'm aware of what was cut out for the theatrical release, so I will concede up front that most of the criticisms about pacing, editing, and missing bits of plot at release were merited.With that caveat out of the way, I must reiterate that this was bar-none the boldest superhero movie I have ever seen. To me, it was arguably the best as well, though \"best\" shouldn't be taken to mean \"most enjoyable.\" That honor easily goes to \"Thor: Ragnarok.\" What makes BvS stand out among other films in the genre is that it takes two characters who have been done to death since the 1970s and brings them up to date. I recently tried to watch \"Superman: The Movie\" for the first time in a number of years, and while it was still good and Reeves will always be iconic, I just couldn't take it seriously. I'll put it this way: If the story in BvS was \"stupid\" in your view but Superman turning back time by spinning the earth backward on its axis didn't seem like one of the dumbest things you have ever seen -in any movie from any genre- to the extent that it outright ruins the movie for you, then your opinion about BvS isn't worth much. Nostalgic bias was always going to be a problem for this movie, and the way people reacted to and reviewed \"Man of Steel\" was telling in this regard.That brings me to Zack Snyder's take on Superman. You know, that guy whose status as the first extraterrestrial ever encountered by humanity was a total non-issue in the old movies. Apparently, Snyder has a similar view to my own in that his take on the Man of Steel makes his being an alien a core piece of his identity. He may look like any other (absurdly attractive) person, but he knows what he is, and that makes him perpetually uncertain of where he fits in this world. He is essentially good and really does care about people, but he struggles to truly empathize with the likes of us. To be human is to be frail, and that is not something he can easily relate to. This is the root of his conflict with Batman.Just as Clark struggles to genuinely relate to most people, Snyder's Batman either refuses to or otherwise just can't relate to Superman. He doesn't see him as anything but a threat regardless of Superman's clear good intentions. Remember, a small group of Kryptonians were able to bring humanity to the brink of extinction in less than a day, and Bruce Wayne is nothing if not a realist. He didn't know the guy from Kansas. He only knew the god from another world.While Batman's anger toward and fear of Superman are readily apparent from the start, Superman's inability to imagine things from Bruce Wayne's perspective only becomes truly apparent during their first real interaction. This reminded me of the animated version of the \"world's finest\" storyline, where Superman judges Batman harshly for using fear tactics and threats of violence (also, actual violence) to get the job done. Superman wasn't willing to consider what it would take for a human man to fight criminals and save innocents, or what that life would do to him over time. Just as Batman didn't see the guy from Kansas, Superman didn't see the man who lives his life trapped in one brutal, unthinkably traumatic moment (this was beautifully conveyed during the film's opening moments), and had spent his whole adult life bearing witness to humanity at its absolute worst.The conflict between these two characters is as old as human history. They want the same things, but they can't understand one another. So they fight. And what a fight it was.Watching a fight between, say, Captain America and Iron Man was, to me, more frustrating than anything because each understood the other's perspective perfectly. The fight between Batman and Superman in BvS was genuinely gut-wrenching, as intended, because they would have understood one another if either had tried. The whole sequence hilighted Batman's tactical prowess and ability to control a situation. Maybe the most badass thing about the fight was that it ended exactly where Batman planned. That brings me to the big elephant in the room named \"Martha.\"I can't recall exactly which YouTuber put it this way, but if you thought the \"save Martha\" exchange was about their mothers having the same name, you had your brain turned off. The brain-on people have explained this to death, but it bears repeating. This was the moment when Superman became humanized to Batman. He was about to die, and his only concern was for his adoptive human mother. He still believed that the man about to take his life would do the right thing. Even with the cowl on, there was no mistaking the look on Batman's face. It was the look of shame, guilt, and sudden uncertainty that says \"What am I doing?\" Turns out even the most brutal, angry version of Bruce Wayne is better than Tony Stark at knowing right from wrong. At knowing that he had gone too far.From there, the third act was a series of truly impressive (albeit mostly CGI) fight sequences, beginning with what I regard as the undisputed champion of Batman fights. Nothing in the Nolan movies (and especially nothing in the Burton movies) even came close. Go ahead, try to convince yourself that Batman and Bane taking turns punching one another in the face until Bane's mask broke was a good fight sequence. No, this was a fight straight out of \"Arkham Knight,\" and it was glorious. The battle against Doomsday really was one for the books. From the moment Wonder Woman arrived accompanied by the intense sounds of Tina Guo's electric cello to Superman's tragic, heroic death at the hands of Doomsday, I was glued to the screen. Sure, the mere presence of Doomsday spoiled the end to a degree, but watching the Man of Steel laboring to carry that kryptonite spear towards certain death was no less impactful. A brief word on Jesse Eisenberg's take on Lex Luthor. At least one other reviewer on this site already said it best when they pointed out that this was his origin story. If you consider his scheme objectively, he is actually one of the more formidable incarnations of the character. If we're lucky, we'll eventually get to see a Snyder Cut of \"Justice League\" and find out where this story was actually meant to go. For the record, Joss Whedon and Danny Elfman both should have said \"no\" to taking a dump on someone else's art."
"BATMAN V SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE brings a fantastic surprise to a smash-hit team-up with one of the worlds most beloved DC Comics' icons of all time. The movie delivers spectacular casting, and fantastic acting with different characters having their shine in each scenes.The story follows Clark Kent/Superman who becomes a threat, after the destruction in Metropolis in Man Of Steel.(2013). Batman/Bruce Wayne sees him as a threat and begins his war on Superman.The movie brings spectacular storytelling, it tells the complications of human against alien who are on the same side, and the first meeting of Batman and Superman. The story of Bruce Wayne, with his many years of The Caped Crusader, sends him on a spiral of \"out of control\", sheer anger, and builds tension to wanting to defeat the Man of Steel. Snyder has fantastically gave this storytelling an exciting nod to the comics.Lex Luthor, played by Jesse Einsberg, delivers a very interesting performance, but very differently by him showing is his \"origin\" before he becomes a bald foe to the Man of Steel. He shows that his love of \"god vs man\" terrorises mankind when he ultimately creates Doomsday, and Batman realises Superman's inner heroism.It packs so many great \"out of nowhere\" excitement, including a first-look of the fearful Wonder Woman a.k.a. Diana Prince, played by Gal Gadot, and a fresh-new glimpse of the superhero DC canon: The Justice League.WATCH THIS MOVIE! The critics are out of their mind. It's a fun-packed action adventure which still keeps the movie enjoyable until it's final minutes of the movie. It's a FANTASTIC MOVIE! BEN AFFLECK AS BATMAN... is Incredible!A 10/10 overall!"
"I want to go on record as saying that this is a truly thrilling cinematic experience in so many ways. If pressed, I guess I could acknowledge that there were a couple ... let's say \"clumsy\" moments. And in a film that runs to three hours, that hardly seems like a significant issue, certainly not enough to rate it with fewer than 9 stars.This film has everything. There is dramatic tension right from the start. There is a magnificent story arc that picks up quite seamlessly from 'Man of Steel' and propels the viewer not only into the life of Clark Kent/Superman but also of Bruce Wayne/Batman.The villain is no mere cartoon of a villain; he is truly thoroughly (and apparently irrevocably) diabolical. He is a psychopath, and you wish for his death over and over and over. You want Superman to reduce him to ash with the power of his eyes.I have read a number of viewers' reviews, and it seems that the people who disliked the film / gave it a low rating had rather unfair and unrealistic expectations of it. That is, their own prejudices about how the plot could/should unfold or what the character development could/should be, etc. ruined the film for them. And that is a shame.My thought is: I settle into my seat, wait for the lights to dim, and then I wait to be transported by the film. I accept it, lock, stock, and barrel.As another reviewer remarked, I love how the film begins from the point of view of Bruce Wayne as he is among people on the ground who have fallen victim to the attack of Zod and the other Kryptonians.Why would Bruce Wayne not like Superman? Why would the good people of Earth hurl insults at Superman and burn him in effigy (on the news)? Because the good people of Earth just got catapulted into a new reality in which there are not only extraterrestrial beings (surprise!) but they are also superman! And a group of them are hell-bent on destroying humankind and taking the planet for themselves.It is difficult to see Superman as separate from the whole Kryptonian Krew.It seems that many moviegoers forgot that Bruce Wayne is also human. Sure, he's a hero, but he is flawed.. Just like the rest of us. He is a vigilante, after all.He has let his vigilantism get the better of him. HE is actually the one working outside the boundaries of the law, not Superman. It is the clear head of Alfred that shows us that he has gone into a rather dark place, that he has not seen what is really going on (in Luthor's scheme), and so he chooses to embark on his own scheme scheme to take out the alien invader. He is (allegedly) thinking of the future: if he wipes out the all-powerful alien, then it can't turn on humankind in the future. At least, he convinces himself of that.A philosophical question is raised in the film: should Clark Kent have remained a simple man from Kansas and never have become the Superman? Should he just let people die and let calamities happen? The question is answered for us in the character of Diana Prince/Wonder Woman. She withdrew from mankind (her exact words) and just sat around watching. Watching while people died horrible deaths all around her. So, should Superman have done the same? Do these special beings, these 'metahumans', have some kind of moral imperative to intervene, or should they be allowed to be regular people, too? It seems that humans want it both ways.It seems that humans are saying: \"Don't be a superalien ... except when I and my friends and family are in trouble. Then come save us.\""

"Batman v Superman: Ultimate Edition: If your looking for a quick, cheap thrill then you might not enjoy this film at the time. This movies theatrical version was butchered by WB and in doing so reshaped the story leaving numerous plot holes. So the Ultimate Edition is the full story and the one worth seeing. Watch 'Man of Steel' before seeing this movie. There is much to claw through here, so much so that the audience might easily find themselves exhausted from the overall aggression of the film. However, a lot of the story does work. The action is good, and the emotion feels real most of the time.This film is about Superman trying to become Superman. Trying to help the world, save people, find a place in this world not as an outcast, and yet is looked at has a threat by many. Superman is not from this world, yet He is trying to be human, find a place in this world, be excepted by earths people, and come into his destiny.This film is also about Batman being Batman for 20 years and losing faith in humanity, and fearing Superman, what Superman can do with his powers. Great film, great plot, great visuals. ---Yidioo"
"I didn't see the film in the theaters and just bought the \"Extended Edition \" on Amazon. I never properly saw Man of Steel- i think I rented it and watched it when already exhausted and fell asleep. I saw the mediocre user reviews and horrible reviews from critics of this film.They really have it wrong. This is the very best either Batman or Superman. It has a different take, on things. Much darker then earlier films even darker then the Christopher Nolan Batman films.First of all Christopher Nolan is an Executive Producer. So how bad could it be? I loved Sucker Punch and Zack Snyder was involved with that. So how bad could this be? Hans Zimmer did the music, so how bad could it be?I remember watching the old Superman TV shows and reading the Superman and Batman comics as a little kid and loved them, but i wouldn't call myself a \"fan boy\" of comic universes, like so many younger people today. As an older adult I will admit my favorite TV show of all time was Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but watched it on DVD only after it had finished. I saw the second of the Dark Knight series in the theater, but the other two, I watched on DVD. They were great, but not my favorite films like so many people. i also loved the first couple Superman and Batman films in the older series. Regardless, i was not waiting with baited breath to see Man of Steel or this one.I'm more of a serious film fan, who can watch Stanley Kubrick films over and over and my favorite films in the last twenty years, are Eyes Wide Shut and Intersteller, both of which i've watched multiple times.So, with that said, take it from me, the critics have this film very wrong, just as critics hated 2001: A Space Odyssey when it first came out. This film will have lasting appreciation.Surprised how much I liked Ben Afleck's Batman. it was hard to get into Henry Cavil's scrawnier looking Superman, but it grew on me. Amy Adams was great as Lois Lane, The Gal Gadol Wonder Women was amazing. Lex Luther was terrific, like Nolan's Joker. Jeremy Irons was the best Alfred ever. Holly Hunter and Diane Lane was good too. The movie had bad reviews but made a billion dollars. Hopefully everyone buys the Ultimate Edition and it breaks sales records and the film is re-appreciated. I have no idea what scenes this Ultimate Edition added, but it is pretty perfect. Now I can't wait for Wonder Woman and the Justice League and as soon as I finish writing this am going to watch Man of Steal. I'm into it now!I can only surmise that the bad reviews stem from too much expectations of the rigid fan boy types and the radical changes in tone, we see in this film.Total masterpiece of cinema, but I have a few criticisms. There are a few hollow scenes of typical Idiot cops and authorities getting everything wrong in a cliché type way and it has a few filler scenes of that type and a few moments here and there that felt rushed and cheesy. Maybe not everything restored into the Ultimate Edition should have been. I wish there had been more Kevin Costner scenes."

"The whole entire Batman V Superman movie was great and yes even though it felt slow to the majority of the people who watched it but to me I enjoyed every part and every scene of Batman V Superman and when it got to the fight scenes both batman VS Superman and the Doomsday fight it brought so much drama, intensity, and epic performances. So with that being said I give this movie a good 10/10 because it really did go to my expectations and it brought a powerful performance and a powerful yet epic introduction to the upcoming Justice League."

"When I first wrote a review for this movie a year ago exclaiming my excitement for the film, I had been high off a fresh dose of live-action DC superheroes playing out the beloved comic book stories that I had grown up on. It was all playing out before my eyes and coming to life. After a few months had passed, I began to notice things about the movie that I disliked: little gaps in the story, things that didn't add up, etc. My original rating of a 10 / 10 dropped to an 8 /10. But today it has gone back up to a 10. The extended version of the film not only rectifies the gaps but also silences critics.Many claimed that the movie was too dark or that it just didn't make sense. To those people, I say: \"Pick up a comic book!\" Many of the critics of this particular film were part of the superhero bandwagon that formed when Marvel began its spree of Avengers-related films. In fact, its estimated that over 60% of people who go to see 'superhero' genre films have never picked up a comic book in their life. I would argue that similar numbers could figure to those which view the CW televised DC Universe shows. People complain that DC comics is just too dark but the fact is that these movies are based upon actual comics which are meant to be dark (ex: The Dark Knight Returns, Injustice, etc.). Its like complaining that Game of Thrones (the TV series) sucks because they kill off too many characters. Read the books! Its frustrating to see such a beautiful work of art like Batman V Superman criticized by those ignorant to its universe and its meaning. This movie is in fact a catalyst that opens numerous doorways and leaves true fans in awe of the possibilities for future movies. But regardless of whether or not people choose to educate themselves, this film's DVD/Blu-ray extended version puts the theater release to shame. All of the plot holes and gaps are filled in 30 minutes of extended footage scattered throughout the film. The movie ultimately becomes more complete and people will wish that the movie had shown the full 3 hours of footage in its theatrical debut. As a major DC comics fan, I will of course pick up on things that a comics fan would not, but someone who does not read comics would learn to appreciate this film in its entirety with the extended version. Get your hands on a copy today or find it on Netflix or the internet somewhere!"

"I ignored the bad reviews and watched anyways. This film had a lot to live up to after Civil War was released and I went into this film expecting the worst. It ended up to be the best Superhero film of 2016 to me. One complaint was that this film was more concerned about universe building than telling a great story than Civil War but for me it was the other way around; Civil War felt like a build up to something else and to be honest, I felt that way when I saw the other MCU films. Batman vs Superman however not only had a great story, but it also felt a lot more consistent than Civil War. This film was way more diverse with the cast than the MCU but unlike the MCU, I felt like this film doesn't go overboard with the SJW stuff like the MCU films or The Star Wars Sequel films do. The Visuals were AMAZING, The Score by Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL was AMAZING as well, The Tone is just right as I actually felt for the characters emotionally, The Cinematography kept my eyes glued to the screen, and the script felt really Intelligent and Complex and despite people calling the writing confusing, I was able to piece it together with no problem whatsoever. This film is similar to Empire Strikes back in terms of popularity so over time after the other movies are released, this movie would probably be more popular.This film was way better than I Expected and deserves another chance.

"Its shame to see what critics and marvel fans did to this movie and targeted Zack Snyder for it. I have seen this movie more than 25 times till date. And i enjoy this movie as much as i enjoyed the first time. The fans who have read DC comics, wouldn't be disappointed in this movie. Its dark movie, yes it is. Because the title shows the intense situation at hand. Two superheroes about to rip each other apart for whatever reasons that brought them to this stage. Yes it had to be dark and intense.Only marvel can be stupid enough to show an alien invasion where humans are loosing the battle and the super heroes are cracking jokes while battles as if they are playing ping pong. a person playing Call of Duty game is more serious while playing than the marvel heroes fighting aliens."

"Last week some news came out from somebody online who had claimed to have seen a finished version of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. If you were like me, you've been leery of checking it out because you weren't sure how much might actually be true. Now Zack Snyder has spoken out about the spoiler-filled post, although his response doesn't really clear anything up.In a word, to MTV, he called the post \"hilarious,which might imply that he's saying that it's mostly, if not entirely, untrue. That might be the case, but then again he could have just said it was untrue and he didn't say that. What he did say, however, is that he doesn't like spoilers. While this may seem odd for the director who's most recent trailer appeared to give away the entire movie, Snyder says that's not the case. Even if you've seen the trailer, you can rest easy, as there is much more we have not seen in then finished film. Says Snyder I have the benefit of seeing the movie. It's cool that think it's too much, and I appreciate people not wanting to know, but there's plenty that they don't know. There's a lot of movie that's not in the trailer. In the process of calling the Batman v Superman Reddit review hilarious, Snyder goes on to talk about how he hates it when spoilers come out. The director would much rather that fans see the movie mostly blind. While he understands that some fans may wish to find the answers before hand, he wants his movies to be mysteries going in. If you're, as an audience member, exploring these articles, looking for answers to questions that you have, maybe you're okay with knowing before you go. It's like an individual taste. But like I said, I want people to see the movie without knowing.Spoilers are a topic that mean different things to different people. While most try to avoid them to some degree, the need to solve the mystery is a nearly universal human experience. We have an inclination to want to know the truth, even while also wanting to be surprised. For most of us getting some information is good, but getting all the information is bad, of course, only getting the details that you want can be difficult."
"The theatrical is choppy, poorly edited, hard to follow, with some really good moments mixed in their. The extended is much more fluent and is much easier to follow, it does have a long runtime, which might make it seem a bit dragging on, but if you like long films done right, like Lord of the Rings, you will like this movie as long as you get into the characters and story. Speaking of which, the story starts out perfectly showing Bruce Wayne as a character, and it is very powerful. There are several moments in this movie that are powerful, emotional, and shocking. Characters. Batman is my favorite fictional character of all time, and believe me when I say, Ben Affleck as Batman was perfect, he had the charisma, the anger, and the look of being through some bad stuff Gal Gadot also does perfect as Wonder Woman, but if you want to really see how good she does, go watch the Wonder Woman movie. Henry Call as Superman. I really don't like it when people say Christopher Reeves is better. Don't get me wrong, Reeves does great, but can you imagine him as Superman in this movie? I wouldn't like it. It would be like Adam West playing Batman in The Dark Knight. Henry Cavill does great in this role, I can say everything about him as I said with Ben Affleck. Jesse Eisenberg as Luthor. I thought it was different in a good way. I've heard a criticism for him as being too much like Joker, but is that a bad thing? Joker is my favorite villain, so to see Superman have an enemy that crazy, but still hold the values Luthor needs to be Luthor, I think it is great. The thing I thought this movie was lacking in the first and second acts was humor, at least good humor. If there was more humor, I would've given this movie a ten because it would give a more relaxing feel to the parts that needed it. All in all though, this movie was awesome, it had powerful moments, it was badass, and just plain fun. It had a great story arc and does its job very well."

"*I will be talking about the Ultimate Edition of the film* This was one of the most anticipated CBM of all time. Ever since the arrival and subsequent success of Marvel's The Avengers people have wondered when will DC launch its own cinematic universe, one of the main reasons being the opportunity to finally see titans such as Batman and Superman share the screen together: the ultimate nerd dream. On 2016, the moment finally came for BvS to be released AND.. it performed poorly. Not only did critical reception left a lot to be desired, but fan reactions where surprisingly split after its cinematic debut. People either loved it and called Zack a genius, or hated it and called him a hack. Me, personally, I found myself with middle of the road feelings, for sure, but more leaning towards the negative side with subsequent viewings. The theatrical cut of the film showcased amazing performances, incredible visuals, and action set pieces that seemed like comic book panels come to life, in a good way. However, when it comes to its narrative structure and more technical aspects like editing, the film was seriously flawed. More plot holes than Age of Ultron, questionable character decisions, random editing that lacked cohesion and focus, and forced dramatic moments that lacked any impact because the attempts at character development ranged from limited to nonexistent, especially when it comes to Superman's character. I thought it was a 5/10 movie at best. As such, I was kind of skeptical about the idea of a 30 minute longer version. I say kind of because I know how Zack works. I remember Watchmen being vastly improved with its director's cut, so in a way I was expecting BvS to perform in a similar manner, but I also feared those 30 minutes wold be just there to amplify action and discredit storytelling issues. Oh boy, I'm so glad I was proved wrong. The ultimate cut of the film was infuriating, but not because it was awful, but because it questions the sanity of WB executives and editors and makes you wonder what were they thinking during the editing process. What I got out of the Ultimate Edition was a thought-provoking deconstruction of two very iconic superheroes that gave spotlight to the struggles both of them face when they aren't fighting crime. What I got was an extremely well produced character study on both Batman and Superman in a cynical world, a world dangerously close to our own. We meet Batman as a ruthless, worn out hero that has seen the failure behind his ideals and witnessed some truly horrifying things in his life. Superman, on the other hand, is portrayed as a godlike figure that seeks to do good in the world, but finds himself emotionally conflicted once he realized that every good deed he does leaves behind a trail of destruction (most of it due to Luthor's antics). In my opinion, this is a hugely original approach, one that distances itself from the rest of the competition and delivers a dark, somber, yet relevant superhero movie that understands both characters and gives them real human struggles to deal with. I felt invested in both of them, and hoped that by the end of the film both could find a way to redeem themselves. Their character arcs were very well established during the first two acts of the movie, and by the time we get to the titular climactic battle the emotion behind the jaw-dropping action is intensified. Lex Luthor as a villain was also given more time to develop with this new edition. One of the main criticisms with the original version was the fact that his plan relied too much on conveniences, and the character's mannerisms and mad-scientist attitude was annoying, and that goes without saying his motivations were unclear. Not only do we spend more time understanding his hate for any godlike figure and thus his hatred for Superman, but the added scenes allowed us to witness his entire plan come to fruition. It sells the cold, manipulative, calculating attributes of his comic counterpart. The acting is spot on. Every actor owns his/her role, from Cavill's Superman, to Ben Affleck as Batman, Eisenberg as Luthor, and Gadot as Wonder Woman, whose scenes are brief, but are more than enough to sell the strong and ferocious warrior that she is. Cinematography is stunning, and miles above that of Man of Steel's. And the soundtrack by Zimmer and Junkie XL? Perfect, just perfect. When it comes to flaws, the film still has some of those. The Martha moment, while serving as a pivotal character moment for Batman, felt off in execution, and its understandable that many people got mad at it. If your main complaint about BvS the first time around was its bleak tone and subject matter, this film is still not for you. I understand most were expecting to see the heroes being the most iconic versions of themselves, clashing in an elongated battle and evoking the same feelings The Avengers gave audiences back in 2012. In that sense, the film will remain divisive, but at least I have the comfort of saying that, at the very least, the film is competently made."

"This film was amazing. Ben Affleck was easily the best part of this movie, he brought his a-game as Batman. The chemistry between Affleck & Irons was outstanding. Gal Gadot did a great job as Wonder Woman. The fight between Batman & Superman was awesome. The final fight with Doomsday was outstanding in every way possible. However, there is only one problem with this film and that's Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor. He was sadly missed cast in this role, but then again it's really the fault of Warner Bros. Studios. Overall, this film deliver on almost every level. I highly recommend that you watch the extended version of this film."

"I know I know. I saw it in theaters too, and felt like it could've been so much better. While the Batman element was good, the narrative felt fractured, and the third act was just one long stunt scene. Superman was relegated to a supporting character, and other characters didn't get a chance to shine. And then I chanced on the ultimate cut. Calling it 30 mins of \"extra\" footage is unfair to Zack Snyder because it's exactly these 30 mins that makes the movie a worthy one. What I can say about the theatrical cut is this - It had the blockbuster elements - music, visuals, stunts, CGI. But, it lacked the human elements. The first 20 mins of the movie had it, but not after that. The extended cut in comparison has a flow to the narrative. There are no disjointed scenes, everything flows smoothly, and there's connective tissue. Superman gets to spend some time with his father, and mother. Clark Kent does some investigative journalism. Superman helps the people after the blast. Lois Lane doesn't jump to conclusions, she gets to the bottom of the crime. Lex Luthor apparently had a coherent plan - everything is explained pretty well. Wonder Woman was already good, so there's no change there :) Also, the \"Martha\" scene seems better executed, because it is a few seconds longer, and there's time to breathe it in. So, here's my take on this movie - The theatrical cut was junk. Get the Bluray for ultimate edition, and you shall not be disappointed. I've seen it so many more times now, and it's the definitive cut. It is the movie we deserve. It's a unique take on Batman, and Superman. It's a gritty take on the superhero movie genre, and definitely the best DCEU movie, and the best DC movie since The Dark Knight.P.S. Yes it's dark. We're adults, and we should appreciate mature film making without intentionally silly moments. It attempts to be philosophical, and something deep instead of just trying to make you chuckle."

"This is one of the best superhero movies ever made. Zack Snyder is a magician behind the camera.The reason behind so many complaints is the fact that Warner Bros. marketed this movie as a fight between Batman and Superman. That's not what it is. It's a movie about the origins of the Justice League.The cinematography, the acting and the score are all second to none. This film is phenomenal.P.S: watch the 3 hour extended cut that Snyder intended you to see, not the 2 and a half hour movie that Warner Bros. decided would be better for theaters."

"I don't care what the critics say, this is a very well-done movie. I'll start my review by listing what I like about the movie.1.) Ben Affleck is the best batman to me and it is not close. He pulls off the role of an aging batman extremely well. Also, Zack Snyder's vision of batman is legit. I have always hated batman up until this adaptation of him. Instead of being a conflicted and idealistic batman, this batman is dark, gritty, and 100% a badass. His equipment is decked out with machine guns and he has no aversion to killing people. In fact, he probably kills about 50 criminal by the time this movie is over. The warehouse scene is the coolest batman scene in any movie.2.) The development of a grudge between batman and superman is pulled off flawlessly. It actually makes sense why batman dislikes superman. Then, when they do fight it is about the coolest thing you can expect to see from a superhero film. 3.) I disagree with a lot of people about Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor. In my opinion, he played his role to perfection. 4.) B v S sets up Wonder Woman and Justice League with Gal Gadot's cameo as Wonder Woman and short clips of Aquaman, the Flash, and Cyborg. B v S is one of my favorite superhero films and rewatching it never gets old."

"The theatrical cut of this film is garbage which is why I rated it eight stars instead of nine. The first time I watched this film I didn't like it (not straight out hate but didn't like). Character motivations didn't make any sense, Lex was annoying as s***, editing was sloppy, and it was overly dark and broody for an action superhero movie. A year + a half, five Marvel films, a ton of bad reviews and a Justice League later a thought popped into my head: \"what if I watched BVS again\". This time I didn't have trailers ruining the best moments, I only vaguely remembered the film, and I was conditioned to look at it negatively but something unexpected happened: I actually loved it. Superman was just a normal person that tried to make a difference cause he could that others imposed their own beliefs on. Lex Luthor was a genius that couldn't stand his powerlessness compared to Superman or more accurately a super being. As Alfred said \"The fever, the rage, the feeling of powerlessness that turns good men... cruel\" and you see the same thought process in Batman. Batman, just like Lex Luthor feels powerless in the midst of a god-being and just like Lex he attempts to destroy him so he can get his sense of power back but unlike Lex, Batman learns something. I what is one of the corniest lines of the movie Superman says, \"Martha\" when he knows he can't win against Batman in a late desperate attempt to save his mother. Not only does this name connect with Bruce Wayne but it also shows what really matters to a man of steel: it isn't power, it isn't fame or anything else, it is his Mother and on a broader scale it is people. Lex (who doesn't care about people at all) knows he doesn't have the power so he creates something from his blood and the remains of Zod: A Doomsday for Superman. Not only does this film have depth but it also doesn't always explain it to you which is rare in a blockbuster action superhero flick normally cater to semi-comic book fans and people that want to shove popcorn in their mouths. This film rewards you for really noticing the details while still having massive explosions. One of my favorites is how Lex has all of Batman's branded killed which is why he isn't afraid of the branding at the end or Grandma's Peach Tea as a way of scaring the s*** out of someone. Of course, this film isn't perfect and I do have personal dislikes. The Batman V Superman fight was slow and pretty boring especially after watching such an amazing fight in Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 2 (If you haven't watched the animated Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 1 and 2 you are sorely missing out on something fantastic). Also, the addition of Wonder Woman who pretty much steals a hacker thing, gives it back and then suits up and fights against a giant monster thing. Not to say I don't like Wonder Woman (She is one of my favorite Superheroes of all time who showed not only can woman kick a** but they also don't need to be ashamed of their sexuality or gender) but she wasn't really that helpful to the plot and just brought in to expand the universe which was well done through Lex's superhuman hunting files. Also, the post-apocalyptic scene that was just a dream could have been cut but nothing is perfect except movies like Citizen Kane which isn't a lot of fun to watch cause it is too perfect. So to summarize, the theatrical cut is bad, the ultimate cut is Amazing and the other cut is meh. Please give it a second chance because it deserves it and save a good director from losing grace because of something he didn't do."
"I really liked it, don't know what all the hate is about. I'm actually a Marvel fan from when I was 7 or so, but Superman and Batman together in 1 movie? Just great. And personally I like Ben Affleck even better than Christian Bale as Batman. So just watch and enjoy, I know I did!"

"That's right. We have been waiting for these two heroes to finally meet and fight against each other. This movie is so good in both plot and special effects.Henry Cavill and Ben Affleck have performed well in their acting stages. They are the best superhero actors and they have filmed their fighting scenes very well. The movie starts to show the conflict between the lives of the heroes and now they have blamed each other for it. This movie is amazing and sets up a good plot for Dawn Justice."

"Actually...I didn't know what to expect. When you see Wonder Woman, you know it will be off of Wonder Woman and off of a Wonder Woman story, but with Batman V Superman, I was like, \"hmmmm, so who is this about?\" It was pretty obvious that it would feature many characters, but I thought the introduction to Batman was amazing. Ben Affleck nailed the part, not only as Batman but also as Bruce Wayne. He is my Batman. Henry Cavill continued to be super as the Man of Steel. And he is my Super - Man. A dark story? Yes, without a doubt. Could it have had a few more jokes? Sure. But not all movies or stories need to have jokes when certain events are serious. I really hope people can see this review and take another look at the movie, because, I loved it. I really hope the ratings can go up, eventually. And P.S, this movie is the perfect set up to Justice League."

"I'll start by making it clear I have only ever seen the Ultimate Edition. I'm aware of what was cut out for the theatrical release, so I will concede up front that most of the criticisms about pacing, editing, and missing bits of plot at release were merited.With that caveat out of the way, I must reiterate that this was bar-none the boldest superhero movie I have ever seen. To me, it was arguably the best as well, though \"best\" shouldn't be taken to mean \"most enjoyable.\" That honor easily goes to \"Thor: Ragnarok.\" What makes BvS stand out among other films in the genre is that it takes two characters who have been done to death since the 1970s and brings them up to date. I recently tried to watch \"Superman: The Movie\" for the first time in a number of years, and while it was still good and Reeves will always be iconic, I just couldn't take it seriously. I'll put it this way: If the story in BvS was \"stupid\" in your view but Superman turning back time by spinning the earth backward on its axis didn't seem like one of the dumbest things you have ever seen -in any movie from any genre- to the extent that it outright ruins the movie for you, then your opinion about BvS isn't worth much. Nostalgic bias was always going to be a problem for this movie, and the way people reacted to and reviewed \"Man of Steel\" was telling in this regard.That brings me to Zack Snyder's take on Superman. You know, that guy whose status as the first extraterrestrial ever encountered by humanity was a total non-issue in the old movies. Apparently, Snyder has a similar view to my own in that his take on the Man of Steel makes his being an alien a core piece of his identity. He may look like any other (absurdly attractive) person, but he knows what he is, and that makes him perpetually uncertain of where he fits in this world. He is essentially good and really does care about people, but he struggles to truly empathize with the likes of us. To be human is to be frail, and that is not something he can easily relate to. This is the root of his conflict with Batman.Just as Clark struggles to genuinely relate to most people, Snyder's Batman either refuses to or otherwise just can't relate to Superman. He doesn't see him as anything but a threat regardless of Superman's clear good intentions. Remember, a small group of Kryptonians were able to bring humanity to the brink of extinction in less than a day, and Bruce Wayne is nothing if not a realist. He didn't know the guy from Kansas. He only knew the god from another world.While Batman's anger toward and fear of Superman are readily apparent from the start, Superman's inability to imagine things from Bruce Wayne's perspective only becomes truly apparent during their first real interaction. This reminded me of the animated version of the \"world's finest\" storyline, where Superman judges Batman harshly for using fear tactics and threats of violence (also, actual violence) to get the job done. Superman wasn't willing to consider what it would take for a human man to fight criminals and save innocents, or what that life would do to him over time. Just as Batman didn't see the guy from Kansas, Superman didn't see the man who lives his life trapped in one brutal, unthinkably traumatic moment (this was beautifully conveyed during the film's opening moments), and had spent his whole adult life bearing witness to humanity at its absolute worst.The conflict between these two characters is as old as human history. They want the same things, but they can't understand one another. So they fight. And what a fight it was.Watching a fight between, say, Captain America and Iron Man was, to me, more frustrating than anything because each understood the other's perspective perfectly. The fight between Batman and Superman in BvS was genuinely gut-wrenching, as intended, because they would have understood one another if either had tried. The whole sequence hilighted Batman's tactical prowess and ability to control a situation. Maybe the most badass thing about the fight was that it ended exactly where Batman planned. That brings me to the big elephant in the room named \"Martha.\"I can't recall exactly which YouTuber put it this way, but if you thought the \"save Martha\" exchange was about their mothers having the same name, you had your brain turned off. The brain-on people have explained this to death, but it bears repeating. This was the moment when Superman became humanized to Batman. He was about to die, and his only concern was for his adoptive human mother. He still believed that the man about to take his life would do the right thing. Even with the cowl on, there was no mistaking the look on Batman's face. It was the look of shame, guilt, and sudden uncertainty that says \"What am I doing?\" Turns out even the most brutal, angry version of Bruce Wayne is better than Tony Stark at knowing right from wrong. At knowing that he had gone too far.From there, the third act was a series of truly impressive (albeit mostly CGI) fight sequences, beginning with what I regard as the undisputed champion of Batman fights. Nothing in the Nolan movies (and especially nothing in the Burton movies) even came close. Go ahead, try to convince yourself that Batman and Bane taking turns punching one another in the face until Bane's mask broke was a good fight sequence. No, this was a fight straight out of \"Arkham Knight,\" and it was glorious. The battle against Doomsday really was one for the books. From the moment Wonder Woman arrived accompanied by the intense sounds of Tina Guo's electric cello to Superman's tragic, heroic death at the hands of Doomsday, I was glued to the screen. Sure, the mere presence of Doomsday spoiled the end to a degree, but watching the Man of Steel laboring to carry that kryptonite spear towards certain death was no less impactful. A brief word on Jesse Eisenberg's take on Lex Luthor. At least one other reviewer on this site already said it best when they pointed out that this was his origin story. If you consider his scheme objectively, he is actually one of the more formidable incarnations of the character. If we're lucky, we'll eventually get to see a Snyder Cut of \"Justice League\" and find out where this story was actually meant to go. For the record, Joss Whedon and Danny Elfman both should have said \"no\" to taking a dump on someone else's art."
"BATMAN V SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE brings a fantastic surprise to a smash-hit team-up with one of the worlds most beloved DC Comics' icons of all time. The movie delivers spectacular casting, and fantastic acting with different characters having their shine in each scenes.The story follows Clark Kent/Superman who becomes a threat, after the destruction in Metropolis in Man Of Steel.(2013). Batman/Bruce Wayne sees him as a threat and begins his war on Superman.The movie brings spectacular storytelling, it tells the complications of human against alien who are on the same side, and the first meeting of Batman and Superman. The story of Bruce Wayne, with his many years of The Caped Crusader, sends him on a spiral of \"out of control\", sheer anger, and builds tension to wanting to defeat the Man of Steel. Snyder has fantastically gave this storytelling an exciting nod to the comics.Lex Luthor, played by Jesse Einsberg, delivers a very interesting performance, but very differently by him showing is his \"origin\" before he becomes a bald foe to the Man of Steel. He shows that his love of \"god vs man\" terrorises mankind when he ultimately creates Doomsday, and Batman realises Superman's inner heroism.It packs so many great \"out of nowhere\" excitement, including a first-look of the fearful Wonder Woman a.k.a. Diana Prince, played by Gal Gadot, and a fresh-new glimpse of the superhero DC canon: The Justice League.WATCH THIS MOVIE! The critics are out of their mind. It's a fun-packed action adventure which still keeps the movie enjoyable until it's final minutes of the movie. It's a FANTASTIC MOVIE! BEN AFFLECK AS BATMAN... is Incredible!A 10/10 overall!"
"I want to go on record as saying that this is a truly thrilling cinematic experience in so many ways. If pressed, I guess I could acknowledge that there were a couple ... let's say \"clumsy\" moments. And in a film that runs to three hours, that hardly seems like a significant issue, certainly not enough to rate it with fewer than 9 stars.This film has everything. There is dramatic tension right from the start. There is a magnificent story arc that picks up quite seamlessly from 'Man of Steel' and propels the viewer not only into the life of Clark Kent/Superman but also of Bruce Wayne/Batman.The villain is no mere cartoon of a villain; he is truly thoroughly (and apparently irrevocably) diabolical. He is a psychopath, and you wish for his death over and over and over. You want Superman to reduce him to ash with the power of his eyes.I have read a number of viewers' reviews, and it seems that the people who disliked the film / gave it a low rating had rather unfair and unrealistic expectations of it. That is, their own prejudices about how the plot could/should unfold or what the character development could/should be, etc. ruined the film for them. And that is a shame.My thought is: I settle into my seat, wait for the lights to dim, and then I wait to be transported by the film. I accept it, lock, stock, and barrel.As another reviewer remarked, I love how the film begins from the point of view of Bruce Wayne as he is among people on the ground who have fallen victim to the attack of Zod and the other Kryptonians.Why would Bruce Wayne not like Superman? Why would the good people of Earth hurl insults at Superman and burn him in effigy (on the news)? Because the good people of Earth just got catapulted into a new reality in which there are not only extraterrestrial beings (surprise!) but they are also superman! And a group of them are hell-bent on destroying humankind and taking the planet for themselves.It is difficult to see Superman as separate from the whole Kryptonian Krew.It seems that many moviegoers forgot that Bruce Wayne is also human. Sure, he's a hero, but he is flawed.. Just like the rest of us. He is a vigilante, after all.He has let his vigilantism get the better of him. HE is actually the one working outside the boundaries of the law, not Superman. It is the clear head of Alfred that shows us that he has gone into a rather dark place, that he has not seen what is really going on (in Luthor's scheme), and so he chooses to embark on his own scheme scheme to take out the alien invader. He is (allegedly) thinking of the future: if he wipes out the all-powerful alien, then it can't turn on humankind in the future. At least, he convinces himself of that.A philosophical question is raised in the film: should Clark Kent have remained a simple man from Kansas and never have become the Superman? Should he just let people die and let calamities happen? The question is answered for us in the character of Diana Prince/Wonder Woman. She withdrew from mankind (her exact words) and just sat around watching. Watching while people died horrible deaths all around her. So, should Superman have done the same? Do these special beings, these 'metahumans', have some kind of moral imperative to intervene, or should they be allowed to be regular people, too? It seems that humans want it both ways.It seems that humans are saying: \"Don't be a superalien ... except when I and my friends and family are in trouble. Then come save us.\""

"Batman v Superman: Ultimate Edition: If your looking for a quick, cheap thrill then you might not enjoy this film at the time. This movies theatrical version was butchered by WB and in doing so reshaped the story leaving numerous plot holes. So the Ultimate Edition is the full story and the one worth seeing. Watch 'Man of Steel' before seeing this movie. There is much to claw through here, so much so that the audience might easily find themselves exhausted from the overall aggression of the film. However, a lot of the story does work. The action is good, and the emotion feels real most of the time.This film is about Superman trying to become Superman. Trying to help the world, save people, find a place in this world not as an outcast, and yet is looked at has a threat by many. Superman is not from this world, yet He is trying to be human, find a place in this world, be excepted by earths people, and come into his destiny.This film is also about Batman being Batman for 20 years and losing faith in humanity, and fearing Superman, what Superman can do with his powers. Great film, great plot, great visuals. ---Yidioo"
"I didn't see the film in the theaters and just bought the \"Extended Edition \" on Amazon. I never properly saw Man of Steel- i think I rented it and watched it when already exhausted and fell asleep. I saw the mediocre user reviews and horrible reviews from critics of this film.They really have it wrong. This is the very best either Batman or Superman. It has a different take, on things. Much darker then earlier films even darker then the Christopher Nolan Batman films.First of all Christopher Nolan is an Executive Producer. So how bad could it be? I loved Sucker Punch and Zack Snyder was involved with that. So how bad could this be? Hans Zimmer did the music, so how bad could it be?I remember watching the old Superman TV shows and reading the Superman and Batman comics as a little kid and loved them, but i wouldn't call myself a \"fan boy\" of comic universes, like so many younger people today. As an older adult I will admit my favorite TV show of all time was Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but watched it on DVD only after it had finished. I saw the second of the Dark Knight series in the theater, but the other two, I watched on DVD. They were great, but not my favorite films like so many people. i also loved the first couple Superman and Batman films in the older series. Regardless, i was not waiting with baited breath to see Man of Steel or this one.I'm more of a serious film fan, who can watch Stanley Kubrick films over and over and my favorite films in the last twenty years, are Eyes Wide Shut and Intersteller, both of which i've watched multiple times.So, with that said, take it from me, the critics have this film very wrong, just as critics hated 2001: A Space Odyssey when it first came out. This film will have lasting appreciation.Surprised how much I liked Ben Afleck's Batman. it was hard to get into Henry Cavil's scrawnier looking Superman, but it grew on me. Amy Adams was great as Lois Lane, The Gal Gadol Wonder Women was amazing. Lex Luther was terrific, like Nolan's Joker. Jeremy Irons was the best Alfred ever. Holly Hunter and Diane Lane was good too. The movie had bad reviews but made a billion dollars. Hopefully everyone buys the Ultimate Edition and it breaks sales records and the film is re-appreciated. I have no idea what scenes this Ultimate Edition added, but it is pretty perfect. Now I can't wait for Wonder Woman and the Justice League and as soon as I finish writing this am going to watch Man of Steal. I'm into it now!I can only surmise that the bad reviews stem from too much expectations of the rigid fan boy types and the radical changes in tone, we see in this film.Total masterpiece of cinema, but I have a few criticisms. There are a few hollow scenes of typical Idiot cops and authorities getting everything wrong in a cliché type way and it has a few filler scenes of that type and a few moments here and there that felt rushed and cheesy. Maybe not everything restored into the Ultimate Edition should have been. I wish there had been more Kevin Costner scenes."

"The whole entire Batman V Superman movie was great and yes even though it felt slow to the majority of the people who watched it but to me I enjoyed every part and every scene of Batman V Superman and when it got to the fight scenes both batman VS Superman and the Doomsday fight it brought so much drama, intensity, and epic performances. So with that being said I give this movie a good 10/10 because it really did go to my expectations and it brought a powerful performance and a powerful yet epic introduction to the upcoming Justice League."

"When I first wrote a review for this movie a year ago exclaiming my excitement for the film, I had been high off a fresh dose of live-action DC superheroes playing out the beloved comic book stories that I had grown up on. It was all playing out before my eyes and coming to life. After a few months had passed, I began to notice things about the movie that I disliked: little gaps in the story, things that didn't add up, etc. My original rating of a 10 / 10 dropped to an 8 /10. But today it has gone back up to a 10. The extended version of the film not only rectifies the gaps but also silences critics.Many claimed that the movie was too dark or that it just didn't make sense. To those people, I say: \"Pick up a comic book!\" Many of the critics of this particular film were part of the superhero bandwagon that formed when Marvel began its spree of Avengers-related films. In fact, its estimated that over 60% of people who go to see 'superhero' genre films have never picked up a comic book in their life. I would argue that similar numbers could figure to those which view the CW televised DC Universe shows. People complain that DC comics is just too dark but the fact is that these movies are based upon actual comics which are meant to be dark (ex: The Dark Knight Returns, Injustice, etc.). Its like complaining that Game of Thrones (the TV series) sucks because they kill off too many characters. Read the books! Its frustrating to see such a beautiful work of art like Batman V Superman criticized by those ignorant to its universe and its meaning. This movie is in fact a catalyst that opens numerous doorways and leaves true fans in awe of the possibilities for future movies. But regardless of whether or not people choose to educate themselves, this film's DVD/Blu-ray extended version puts the theater release to shame. All of the plot holes and gaps are filled in 30 minutes of extended footage scattered throughout the film. The movie ultimately becomes more complete and people will wish that the movie had shown the full 3 hours of footage in its theatrical debut. As a major DC comics fan, I will of course pick up on things that a comics fan would not, but someone who does not read comics would learn to appreciate this film in its entirety with the extended version. Get your hands on a copy today or find it on Netflix or the internet somewhere!"

"I ignored the bad reviews and watched anyways. This film had a lot to live up to after Civil War was released and I went into this film expecting the worst. It ended up to be the best Superhero film of 2016 to me. One complaint was that this film was more concerned about universe building than telling a great story than Civil War but for me it was the other way around; Civil War felt like a build up to something else and to be honest, I felt that way when I saw the other MCU films. Batman vs Superman however not only had a great story, but it also felt a lot more consistent than Civil War. This film was way more diverse with the cast than the MCU but unlike the MCU, I felt like this film doesn't go overboard with the SJW stuff like the MCU films or The Star Wars Sequel films do. The Visuals were AMAZING, The Score by Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL was AMAZING as well, The Tone is just right as I actually felt for the characters emotionally, The Cinematography kept my eyes glued to the screen, and the script felt really Intelligent and Complex and despite people calling the writing confusing, I was able to piece it together with no problem whatsoever. This film is similar to Empire Strikes back in terms of popularity so over time after the other movies are released, this movie would probably be more popular.This film was way better than I Expected and deserves another chance.

"Its shame to see what critics and marvel fans did to this movie and targeted Zack Snyder for it. I have seen this movie more than 25 times till date. And i enjoy this movie as much as i enjoyed the first time. The fans who have read DC comics, wouldn't be disappointed in this movie. Its dark movie, yes it is. Because the title shows the intense situation at hand. Two superheroes about to rip each other apart for whatever reasons that brought them to this stage. Yes it had to be dark and intense.Only marvel can be stupid enough to show an alien invasion where humans are loosing the battle and the super heroes are cracking jokes while battles as if they are playing ping pong. a person playing Call of Duty game is more serious while playing than the marvel heroes fighting aliens."

"Last week some news came out from somebody online who had claimed to have seen a finished version of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. If you were like me, you've been leery of checking it out because you weren't sure how much might actually be true. Now Zack Snyder has spoken out about the spoiler-filled post, although his response doesn't really clear anything up.In a word, to MTV, he called the post \"hilarious,which might imply that he's saying that it's mostly, if not entirely, untrue. That might be the case, but then again he could have just said it was untrue and he didn't say that. What he did say, however, is that he doesn't like spoilers. While this may seem odd for the director who's most recent trailer appeared to give away the entire movie, Snyder says that's not the case. Even if you've seen the trailer, you can rest easy, as there is much more we have not seen in then finished film. Says Snyder I have the benefit of seeing the movie. It's cool that think it's too much, and I appreciate people not wanting to know, but there's plenty that they don't know. There's a lot of movie that's not in the trailer. In the process of calling the Batman v Superman Reddit review hilarious, Snyder goes on to talk about how he hates it when spoilers come out. The director would much rather that fans see the movie mostly blind. While he understands that some fans may wish to find the answers before hand, he wants his movies to be mysteries going in. If you're, as an audience member, exploring these articles, looking for answers to questions that you have, maybe you're okay with knowing before you go. It's like an individual taste. But like I said, I want people to see the movie without knowing.Spoilers are a topic that mean different things to different people. While most try to avoid them to some degree, the need to solve the mystery is a nearly universal human experience. We have an inclination to want to know the truth, even while also wanting to be surprised. For most of us getting some information is good, but getting all the information is bad, of course, only getting the details that you want can be difficult."
"The theatrical is choppy, poorly edited, hard to follow, with some really good moments mixed in their. The extended is much more fluent and is much easier to follow, it does have a long runtime, which might make it seem a bit dragging on, but if you like long films done right, like Lord of the Rings, you will like this movie as long as you get into the characters and story. Speaking of which, the story starts out perfectly showing Bruce Wayne as a character, and it is very powerful. There are several moments in this movie that are powerful, emotional, and shocking. Characters. Batman is my favorite fictional character of all time, and believe me when I say, Ben Affleck as Batman was perfect, he had the charisma, the anger, and the look of being through some bad stuff Gal Gadot also does perfect as Wonder Woman, but if you want to really see how good she does, go watch the Wonder Woman movie. Henry Call as Superman. I really don't like it when people say Christopher Reeves is better. Don't get me wrong, Reeves does great, but can you imagine him as Superman in this movie? I wouldn't like it. It would be like Adam West playing Batman in The Dark Knight. Henry Cavill does great in this role, I can say everything about him as I said with Ben Affleck. Jesse Eisenberg as Luthor. I thought it was different in a good way. I've heard a criticism for him as being too much like Joker, but is that a bad thing? Joker is my favorite villain, so to see Superman have an enemy that crazy, but still hold the values Luthor needs to be Luthor, I think it is great. The thing I thought this movie was lacking in the first and second acts was humor, at least good humor. If there was more humor, I would've given this movie a ten because it would give a more relaxing feel to the parts that needed it. All in all though, this movie was awesome, it had powerful moments, it was badass, and just plain fun. It had a great story arc and does its job very well."

"*I will be talking about the Ultimate Edition of the film* This was one of the most anticipated CBM of all time. Ever since the arrival and subsequent success of Marvel's The Avengers people have wondered when will DC launch its own cinematic universe, one of the main reasons being the opportunity to finally see titans such as Batman and Superman share the screen together: the ultimate nerd dream. On 2016, the moment finally came for BvS to be released AND.. it performed poorly. Not only did critical reception left a lot to be desired, but fan reactions where surprisingly split after its cinematic debut. People either loved it and called Zack a genius, or hated it and called him a hack. Me, personally, I found myself with middle of the road feelings, for sure, but more leaning towards the negative side with subsequent viewings. The theatrical cut of the film showcased amazing performances, incredible visuals, and action set pieces that seemed like comic book panels come to life, in a good way. However, when it comes to its narrative structure and more technical aspects like editing, the film was seriously flawed. More plot holes than Age of Ultron, questionable character decisions, random editing that lacked cohesion and focus, and forced dramatic moments that lacked any impact because the attempts at character development ranged from limited to nonexistent, especially when it comes to Superman's character. I thought it was a 5/10 movie at best. As such, I was kind of skeptical about the idea of a 30 minute longer version. I say kind of because I know how Zack works. I remember Watchmen being vastly improved with its director's cut, so in a way I was expecting BvS to perform in a similar manner, but I also feared those 30 minutes wold be just there to amplify action and discredit storytelling issues. Oh boy, I'm so glad I was proved wrong. The ultimate cut of the film was infuriating, but not because it was awful, but because it questions the sanity of WB executives and editors and makes you wonder what were they thinking during the editing process. What I got out of the Ultimate Edition was a thought-provoking deconstruction of two very iconic superheroes that gave spotlight to the struggles both of them face when they aren't fighting crime. What I got was an extremely well produced character study on both Batman and Superman in a cynical world, a world dangerously close to our own. We meet Batman as a ruthless, worn out hero that has seen the failure behind his ideals and witnessed some truly horrifying things in his life. Superman, on the other hand, is portrayed as a godlike figure that seeks to do good in the world, but finds himself emotionally conflicted once he realized that every good deed he does leaves behind a trail of destruction (most of it due to Luthor's antics). In my opinion, this is a hugely original approach, one that distances itself from the rest of the competition and delivers a dark, somber, yet relevant superhero movie that understands both characters and gives them real human struggles to deal with. I felt invested in both of them, and hoped that by the end of the film both could find a way to redeem themselves. Their character arcs were very well established during the first two acts of the movie, and by the time we get to the titular climactic battle the emotion behind the jaw-dropping action is intensified. Lex Luthor as a villain was also given more time to develop with this new edition. One of the main criticisms with the original version was the fact that his plan relied too much on conveniences, and the character's mannerisms and mad-scientist attitude was annoying, and that goes without saying his motivations were unclear. Not only do we spend more time understanding his hate for any godlike figure and thus his hatred for Superman, but the added scenes allowed us to witness his entire plan come to fruition. It sells the cold, manipulative, calculating attributes of his comic counterpart. The acting is spot on. Every actor owns his/her role, from Cavill's Superman, to Ben Affleck as Batman, Eisenberg as Luthor, and Gadot as Wonder Woman, whose scenes are brief, but are more than enough to sell the strong and ferocious warrior that she is. Cinematography is stunning, and miles above that of Man of Steel's. And the soundtrack by Zimmer and Junkie XL? Perfect, just perfect. When it comes to flaws, the film still has some of those. The Martha moment, while serving as a pivotal character moment for Batman, felt off in execution, and its understandable that many people got mad at it. If your main complaint about BvS the first time around was its bleak tone and subject matter, this film is still not for you. I understand most were expecting to see the heroes being the most iconic versions of themselves, clashing in an elongated battle and evoking the same feelings The Avengers gave audiences back in 2012. In that sense, the film will remain divisive, but at least I have the comfort of saying that, at the very least, the film is competently made."

"This film was amazing. Ben Affleck was easily the best part of this movie, he brought his a-game as Batman. The chemistry between Affleck & Irons was outstanding. Gal Gadot did a great job as Wonder Woman. The fight between Batman & Superman was awesome. The final fight with Doomsday was outstanding in every way possible. However, there is only one problem with this film and that's Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor. He was sadly missed cast in this role, but then again it's really the fault of Warner Bros. Studios. Overall, this film deliver on almost every level. I highly recommend that you watch the extended version of this film."

"I know I know. I saw it in theaters too, and felt like it could've been so much better. While the Batman element was good, the narrative felt fractured, and the third act was just one long stunt scene. Superman was relegated to a supporting character, and other characters didn't get a chance to shine. And then I chanced on the ultimate cut. Calling it 30 mins of \"extra\" footage is unfair to Zack Snyder because it's exactly these 30 mins that makes the movie a worthy one. What I can say about the theatrical cut is this - It had the blockbuster elements - music, visuals, stunts, CGI. But, it lacked the human elements. The first 20 mins of the movie had it, but not after that. The extended cut in comparison has a flow to the narrative. There are no disjointed scenes, everything flows smoothly, and there's connective tissue. Superman gets to spend some time with his father, and mother. Clark Kent does some investigative journalism. Superman helps the people after the blast. Lois Lane doesn't jump to conclusions, she gets to the bottom of the crime. Lex Luthor apparently had a coherent plan - everything is explained pretty well. Wonder Woman was already good, so there's no change there :) Also, the \"Martha\" scene seems better executed, because it is a few seconds longer, and there's time to breathe it in. So, here's my take on this movie - The theatrical cut was junk. Get the Bluray for ultimate edition, and you shall not be disappointed. I've seen it so many more times now, and it's the definitive cut. It is the movie we deserve. It's a unique take on Batman, and Superman. It's a gritty take on the superhero movie genre, and definitely the best DCEU movie, and the best DC movie since The Dark Knight.P.S. Yes it's dark. We're adults, and we should appreciate mature film making without intentionally silly moments. It attempts to be philosophical, and something deep instead of just trying to make you chuckle."

"This is one of the best superhero movies ever made. Zack Snyder is a magician behind the camera.The reason behind so many complaints is the fact that Warner Bros. marketed this movie as a fight between Batman and Superman. That's not what it is. It's a movie about the origins of the Justice League.The cinematography, the acting and the score are all second to none. This film is phenomenal.P.S: watch the 3 hour extended cut that Snyder intended you to see, not the 2 and a half hour movie that Warner Bros. decided would be better for theaters."

"I don't care what the critics say, this is a very well-done movie. I'll start my review by listing what I like about the movie.1.) Ben Affleck is the best batman to me and it is not close. He pulls off the role of an aging batman extremely well. Also, Zack Snyder's vision of batman is legit. I have always hated batman up until this adaptation of him. Instead of being a conflicted and idealistic batman, this batman is dark, gritty, and 100% a badass. His equipment is decked out with machine guns and he has no aversion to killing people. In fact, he probably kills about 50 criminal by the time this movie is over. The warehouse scene is the coolest batman scene in any movie.2.) The development of a grudge between batman and superman is pulled off flawlessly. It actually makes sense why batman dislikes superman. Then, when they do fight it is about the coolest thing you can expect to see from a superhero film. 3.) I disagree with a lot of people about Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor. In my opinion, he played his role to perfection. 4.) B v S sets up Wonder Woman and Justice League with Gal Gadot's cameo as Wonder Woman and short clips of Aquaman, the Flash, and Cyborg. B v S is one of my favorite superhero films and rewatching it never gets old."

"The theatrical cut of this film is garbage which is why I rated it eight stars instead of nine. The first time I watched this film I didn't like it (not straight out hate but didn't like). Character motivations didn't make any sense, Lex was annoying as s***, editing was sloppy, and it was overly dark and broody for an action superhero movie. A year + a half, five Marvel films, a ton of bad reviews and a Justice League later a thought popped into my head: \"what if I watched BVS again\". This time I didn't have trailers ruining the best moments, I only vaguely remembered the film, and I was conditioned to look at it negatively but something unexpected happened: I actually loved it. Superman was just a normal person that tried to make a difference cause he could that others imposed their own beliefs on. Lex Luthor was a genius that couldn't stand his powerlessness compared to Superman or more accurately a super being. As Alfred said \"The fever, the rage, the feeling of powerlessness that turns good men... cruel\" and you see the same thought process in Batman. Batman, just like Lex Luthor feels powerless in the midst of a god-being and just like Lex he attempts to destroy him so he can get his sense of power back but unlike Lex, Batman learns something. I what is one of the corniest lines of the movie Superman says, \"Martha\" when he knows he can't win against Batman in a late desperate attempt to save his mother. Not only does this name connect with Bruce Wayne but it also shows what really matters to a man of steel: it isn't power, it isn't fame or anything else, it is his Mother and on a broader scale it is people. Lex (who doesn't care about people at all) knows he doesn't have the power so he creates something from his blood and the remains of Zod: A Doomsday for Superman. Not only does this film have depth but it also doesn't always explain it to you which is rare in a blockbuster action superhero flick normally cater to semi-comic book fans and people that want to shove popcorn in their mouths. This film rewards you for really noticing the details while still having massive explosions. One of my favorites is how Lex has all of Batman's branded killed which is why he isn't afraid of the branding at the end or Grandma's Peach Tea as a way of scaring the s*** out of someone. Of course, this film isn't perfect and I do have personal dislikes. The Batman V Superman fight was slow and pretty boring especially after watching such an amazing fight in Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 2 (If you haven't watched the animated Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 1 and 2 you are sorely missing out on something fantastic). Also, the addition of Wonder Woman who pretty much steals a hacker thing, gives it back and then suits up and fights against a giant monster thing. Not to say I don't like Wonder Woman (She is one of my favorite Superheroes of all time who showed not only can woman kick a** but they also don't need to be ashamed of their sexuality or gender) but she wasn't really that helpful to the plot and just brought in to expand the universe which was well done through Lex's superhuman hunting files. Also, the post-apocalyptic scene that was just a dream could have been cut but nothing is perfect except movies like Citizen Kane which isn't a lot of fun to watch cause it is too perfect. So to summarize, the theatrical cut is bad, the ultimate cut is Amazing and the other cut is meh. Please give it a second chance because it deserves it and save a good director from losing grace because of something he didn't do."
"I really liked it, don't know what all the hate is about. I'm actually a Marvel fan from when I was 7 or so, but Superman and Batman together in 1 movie? Just great. And personally I like Ben Affleck even better than Christian Bale as Batman. So just watch and enjoy, I know I did!"

"That's right. We have been waiting for these two heroes to finally meet and fight against each other. This movie is so good in both plot and special effects.Henry Cavill and Ben Affleck have performed well in their acting stages. They are the best superhero actors and they have filmed their fighting scenes very well. The movie starts to show the conflict between the lives of the heroes and now they have blamed each other for it. This movie is amazing and sets up a good plot for Dawn Justice."

"Actually...I didn't know what to expect. When you see Wonder Woman, you know it will be off of Wonder Woman and off of a Wonder Woman story, but with Batman V Superman, I was like, \"hmmmm, so who is this about?\" It was pretty obvious that it would feature many characters, but I thought the introduction to Batman was amazing. Ben Affleck nailed the part, not only as Batman but also as Bruce Wayne. He is my Batman. Henry Cavill continued to be super as the Man of Steel. And he is my Super - Man. A dark story? Yes, without a doubt. Could it have had a few more jokes? Sure. But not all movies or stories need to have jokes when certain events are serious. I really hope people can see this review and take another look at the movie, because, I loved it. I really hope the ratings can go up, eventually. And P.S, this movie is the perfect set up to Justice League."

"I'll start by making it clear I have only ever seen the Ultimate Edition. I'm aware of what was cut out for the theatrical release, so I will concede up front that most of the criticisms about pacing, editing, and missing bits of plot at release were merited.With that caveat out of the way, I must reiterate that this was bar-none the boldest superhero movie I have ever seen. To me, it was arguably the best as well, though \"best\" shouldn't be taken to mean \"most enjoyable.\" That honor easily goes to \"Thor: Ragnarok.\" What makes BvS stand out among other films in the genre is that it takes two characters who have been done to death since the 1970s and brings them up to date. I recently tried to watch \"Superman: The Movie\" for the first time in a number of years, and while it was still good and Reeves will always be iconic, I just couldn't take it seriously. I'll put it this way: If the story in BvS was \"stupid\" in your view but Superman turning back time by spinning the earth backward on its axis didn't seem like one of the dumbest things you have ever seen -in any movie from any genre- to the extent that it outright ruins the movie for you, then your opinion about BvS isn't worth much. Nostalgic bias was always going to be a problem for this movie, and the way people reacted to and reviewed \"Man of Steel\" was telling in this regard.That brings me to Zack Snyder's take on Superman. You know, that guy whose status as the first extraterrestrial ever encountered by humanity was a total non-issue in the old movies. Apparently, Snyder has a similar view to my own in that his take on the Man of Steel makes his being an alien a core piece of his identity. He may look like any other (absurdly attractive) person, but he knows what he is, and that makes him perpetually uncertain of where he fits in this world. He is essentially good and really does care about people, but he struggles to truly empathize with the likes of us. To be human is to be frail, and that is not something he can easily relate to. This is the root of his conflict with Batman.Just as Clark struggles to genuinely relate to most people, Snyder's Batman either refuses to or otherwise just can't relate to Superman. He doesn't see him as anything but a threat regardless of Superman's clear good intentions. Remember, a small group of Kryptonians were able to bring humanity to the brink of extinction in less than a day, and Bruce Wayne is nothing if not a realist. He didn't know the guy from Kansas. He only knew the god from another world.While Batman's anger toward and fear of Superman are readily apparent from the start, Superman's inability to imagine things from Bruce Wayne's perspective only becomes truly apparent during their first real interaction. This reminded me of the animated version of the \"world's finest\" storyline, where Superman judges Batman harshly for using fear tactics and threats of violence (also, actual violence) to get the job done. Superman wasn't willing to consider what it would take for a human man to fight criminals and save innocents, or what that life would do to him over time. Just as Batman didn't see the guy from Kansas, Superman didn't see the man who lives his life trapped in one brutal, unthinkably traumatic moment (this was beautifully conveyed during the film's opening moments), and had spent his whole adult life bearing witness to humanity at its absolute worst.The conflict between these two characters is as old as human history. They want the same things, but they can't understand one another. So they fight. And what a fight it was.Watching a fight between, say, Captain America and Iron Man was, to me, more frustrating than anything because each understood the other's perspective perfectly. The fight between Batman and Superman in BvS was genuinely gut-wrenching, as intended, because they would have understood one another if either had tried. The whole sequence hilighted Batman's tactical prowess and ability to control a situation. Maybe the most badass thing about the fight was that it ended exactly where Batman planned. That brings me to the big elephant in the room named \"Martha.\"I can't recall exactly which YouTuber put it this way, but if you thought the \"save Martha\" exchange was about their mothers having the same name, you had your brain turned off. The brain-on people have explained this to death, but it bears repeating. This was the moment when Superman became humanized to Batman. He was about to die, and his only concern was for his adoptive human mother. He still believed that the man about to take his life would do the right thing. Even with the cowl on, there was no mistaking the look on Batman's face. It was the look of shame, guilt, and sudden uncertainty that says \"What am I doing?\" Turns out even the most brutal, angry version of Bruce Wayne is better than Tony Stark at knowing right from wrong. At knowing that he had gone too far.From there, the third act was a series of truly impressive (albeit mostly CGI) fight sequences, beginning with what I regard as the undisputed champion of Batman fights. Nothing in the Nolan movies (and especially nothing in the Burton movies) even came close. Go ahead, try to convince yourself that Batman and Bane taking turns punching one another in the face until Bane's mask broke was a good fight sequence. No, this was a fight straight out of \"Arkham Knight,\" and it was glorious. The battle against Doomsday really was one for the books. From the moment Wonder Woman arrived accompanied by the intense sounds of Tina Guo's electric cello to Superman's tragic, heroic death at the hands of Doomsday, I was glued to the screen. Sure, the mere presence of Doomsday spoiled the end to a degree, but watching the Man of Steel laboring to carry that kryptonite spear towards certain death was no less impactful. A brief word on Jesse Eisenberg's take on Lex Luthor. At least one other reviewer on this site already said it best when they pointed out that this was his origin story. If you consider his scheme objectively, he is actually one of the more formidable incarnations of the character. If we're lucky, we'll eventually get to see a Snyder Cut of \"Justice League\" and find out where this story was actually meant to go. For the record, Joss Whedon and Danny Elfman both should have said \"no\" to taking a dump on someone else's art."
"BATMAN V SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE brings a fantastic surprise to a smash-hit team-up with one of the worlds most beloved DC Comics' icons of all time. The movie delivers spectacular casting, and fantastic acting with different characters having their shine in each scenes.The story follows Clark Kent/Superman who becomes a threat, after the destruction in Metropolis in Man Of Steel.(2013). Batman/Bruce Wayne sees him as a threat and begins his war on Superman.The movie brings spectacular storytelling, it tells the complications of human against alien who are on the same side, and the first meeting of Batman and Superman. The story of Bruce Wayne, with his many years of The Caped Crusader, sends him on a spiral of \"out of control\", sheer anger, and builds tension to wanting to defeat the Man of Steel. Snyder has fantastically gave this storytelling an exciting nod to the comics.Lex Luthor, played by Jesse Einsberg, delivers a very interesting performance, but very differently by him showing is his \"origin\" before he becomes a bald foe to the Man of Steel. He shows that his love of \"god vs man\" terrorises mankind when he ultimately creates Doomsday, and Batman realises Superman's inner heroism.It packs so many great \"out of nowhere\" excitement, including a first-look of the fearful Wonder Woman a.k.a. Diana Prince, played by Gal Gadot, and a fresh-new glimpse of the superhero DC canon: The Justice League.WATCH THIS MOVIE! The critics are out of their mind. It's a fun-packed action adventure which still keeps the movie enjoyable until it's final minutes of the movie. It's a FANTASTIC MOVIE! BEN AFFLECK AS BATMAN... is Incredible!A 10/10 overall!"
"I want to go on record as saying that this is a truly thrilling cinematic experience in so many ways. If pressed, I guess I could acknowledge that there were a couple ... let's say \"clumsy\" moments. And in a film that runs to three hours, that hardly seems like a significant issue, certainly not enough to rate it with fewer than 9 stars.This film has everything. There is dramatic tension right from the start. There is a magnificent story arc that picks up quite seamlessly from 'Man of Steel' and propels the viewer not only into the life of Clark Kent/Superman but also of Bruce Wayne/Batman.The villain is no mere cartoon of a villain; he is truly thoroughly (and apparently irrevocably) diabolical. He is a psychopath, and you wish for his death over and over and over. You want Superman to reduce him to ash with the power of his eyes.I have read a number of viewers' reviews, and it seems that the people who disliked the film / gave it a low rating had rather unfair and unrealistic expectations of it. That is, their own prejudices about how the plot could/should unfold or what the character development could/should be, etc. ruined the film for them. And that is a shame.My thought is: I settle into my seat, wait for the lights to dim, and then I wait to be transported by the film. I accept it, lock, stock, and barrel.As another reviewer remarked, I love how the film begins from the point of view of Bruce Wayne as he is among people on the ground who have fallen victim to the attack of Zod and the other Kryptonians.Why would Bruce Wayne not like Superman? Why would the good people of Earth hurl insults at Superman and burn him in effigy (on the news)? Because the good people of Earth just got catapulted into a new reality in which there are not only extraterrestrial beings (surprise!) but they are also superman! And a group of them are hell-bent on destroying humankind and taking the planet for themselves.It is difficult to see Superman as separate from the whole Kryptonian Krew.It seems that many moviegoers forgot that Bruce Wayne is also human. Sure, he's a hero, but he is flawed.. Just like the rest of us. He is a vigilante, after all.He has let his vigilantism get the better of him. HE is actually the one working outside the boundaries of the law, not Superman. It is the clear head of Alfred that shows us that he has gone into a rather dark place, that he has not seen what is really going on (in Luthor's scheme), and so he chooses to embark on his own scheme scheme to take out the alien invader. He is (allegedly) thinking of the future: if he wipes out the all-powerful alien, then it can't turn on humankind in the future. At least, he convinces himself of that.A philosophical question is raised in the film: should Clark Kent have remained a simple man from Kansas and never have become the Superman? Should he just let people die and let calamities happen? The question is answered for us in the character of Diana Prince/Wonder Woman. She withdrew from mankind (her exact words) and just sat around watching. Watching while people died horrible deaths all around her. So, should Superman have done the same? Do these special beings, these 'metahumans', have some kind of moral imperative to intervene, or should they be allowed to be regular people, too? It seems that humans want it both ways.It seems that humans are saying: \"Don't be a superalien ... except when I and my friends and family are in trouble. Then come save us.\""

"Batman v Superman: Ultimate Edition: If your looking for a quick, cheap thrill then you might not enjoy this film at the time. This movies theatrical version was butchered by WB and in doing so reshaped the story leaving numerous plot holes. So the Ultimate Edition is the full story and the one worth seeing. Watch 'Man of Steel' before seeing this movie. There is much to claw through here, so much so that the audience might easily find themselves exhausted from the overall aggression of the film. However, a lot of the story does work. The action is good, and the emotion feels real most of the time.This film is about Superman trying to become Superman. Trying to help the world, save people, find a place in this world not as an outcast, and yet is looked at has a threat by many. Superman is not from this world, yet He is trying to be human, find a place in this world, be excepted by earths people, and come into his destiny.This film is also about Batman being Batman for 20 years and losing faith in humanity, and fearing Superman, what Superman can do with his powers. Great film, great plot, great visuals. ---Yidioo"
"I didn't see the film in the theaters and just bought the \"Extended Edition \" on Amazon. I never properly saw Man of Steel- i think I rented it and watched it when already exhausted and fell asleep. I saw the mediocre user reviews and horrible reviews from critics of this film.They really have it wrong. This is the very best either Batman or Superman. It has a different take, on things. Much darker then earlier films even darker then the Christopher Nolan Batman films.First of all Christopher Nolan is an Executive Producer. So how bad could it be? I loved Sucker Punch and Zack Snyder was involved with that. So how bad could this be? Hans Zimmer did the music, so how bad could it be?I remember watching the old Superman TV shows and reading the Superman and Batman comics as a little kid and loved them, but i wouldn't call myself a \"fan boy\" of comic universes, like so many younger people today. As an older adult I will admit my favorite TV show of all time was Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but watched it on DVD only after it had finished. I saw the second of the Dark Knight series in the theater, but the other two, I watched on DVD. They were great, but not my favorite films like so many people. i also loved the first couple Superman and Batman films in the older series. Regardless, i was not waiting with baited breath to see Man of Steel or this one.I'm more of a serious film fan, who can watch Stanley Kubrick films over and over and my favorite films in the last twenty years, are Eyes Wide Shut and Intersteller, both of which i've watched multiple times.So, with that said, take it from me, the critics have this film very wrong, just as critics hated 2001: A Space Odyssey when it first came out. This film will have lasting appreciation.Surprised how much I liked Ben Afleck's Batman. it was hard to get into Henry Cavil's scrawnier looking Superman, but it grew on me. Amy Adams was great as Lois Lane, The Gal Gadol Wonder Women was amazing. Lex Luther was terrific, like Nolan's Joker. Jeremy Irons was the best Alfred ever. Holly Hunter and Diane Lane was good too. The movie had bad reviews but made a billion dollars. Hopefully everyone buys the Ultimate Edition and it breaks sales records and the film is re-appreciated. I have no idea what scenes this Ultimate Edition added, but it is pretty perfect. Now I can't wait for Wonder Woman and the Justice League and as soon as I finish writing this am going to watch Man of Steal. I'm into it now!I can only surmise that the bad reviews stem from too much expectations of the rigid fan boy types and the radical changes in tone, we see in this film.Total masterpiece of cinema, but I have a few criticisms. There are a few hollow scenes of typical Idiot cops and authorities getting everything wrong in a cliché type way and it has a few filler scenes of that type and a few moments here and there that felt rushed and cheesy. Maybe not everything restored into the Ultimate Edition should have been. I wish there had been more Kevin Costner scenes."

"The whole entire Batman V Superman movie was great and yes even though it felt slow to the majority of the people who watched it but to me I enjoyed every part and every scene of Batman V Superman and when it got to the fight scenes both batman VS Superman and the Doomsday fight it brought so much drama, intensity, and epic performances. So with that being said I give this movie a good 10/10 because it really did go to my expectations and it brought a powerful performance and a powerful yet epic introduction to the upcoming Justice League."

"When I first wrote a review for this movie a year ago exclaiming my excitement for the film, I had been high off a fresh dose of live-action DC superheroes playing out the beloved comic book stories that I had grown up on. It was all playing out before my eyes and coming to life. After a few months had passed, I began to notice things about the movie that I disliked: little gaps in the story, things that didn't add up, etc. My original rating of a 10 / 10 dropped to an 8 /10. But today it has gone back up to a 10. The extended version of the film not only rectifies the gaps but also silences critics.Many claimed that the movie was too dark or that it just didn't make sense. To those people, I say: \"Pick up a comic book!\" Many of the critics of this particular film were part of the superhero bandwagon that formed when Marvel began its spree of Avengers-related films. In fact, its estimated that over 60% of people who go to see 'superhero' genre films have never picked up a comic book in their life. I would argue that similar numbers could figure to those which view the CW televised DC Universe shows. People complain that DC comics is just too dark but the fact is that these movies are based upon actual comics which are meant to be dark (ex: The Dark Knight Returns, Injustice, etc.). Its like complaining that Game of Thrones (the TV series) sucks because they kill off too many characters. Read the books! Its frustrating to see such a beautiful work of art like Batman V Superman criticized by those ignorant to its universe and its meaning. This movie is in fact a catalyst that opens numerous doorways and leaves true fans in awe of the possibilities for future movies. But regardless of whether or not people choose to educate themselves, this film's DVD/Blu-ray extended version puts the theater release to shame. All of the plot holes and gaps are filled in 30 minutes of extended footage scattered throughout the film. The movie ultimately becomes more complete and people will wish that the movie had shown the full 3 hours of footage in its theatrical debut. As a major DC comics fan, I will of course pick up on things that a comics fan would not, but someone who does not read comics would learn to appreciate this film in its entirety with the extended version. Get your hands on a copy today or find it on Netflix or the internet somewhere!"

"I ignored the bad reviews and watched anyways. This film had a lot to live up to after Civil War was released and I went into this film expecting the worst. It ended up to be the best Superhero film of 2016 to me. One complaint was that this film was more concerned about universe building than telling a great story than Civil War but for me it was the other way around; Civil War felt like a build up to something else and to be honest, I felt that way when I saw the other MCU films. Batman vs Superman however not only had a great story, but it also felt a lot more consistent than Civil War. This film was way more diverse with the cast than the MCU but unlike the MCU, I felt like this film doesn't go overboard with the SJW stuff like the MCU films or The Star Wars Sequel films do. The Visuals were AMAZING, The Score by Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL was AMAZING as well, The Tone is just right as I actually felt for the characters emotionally, The Cinematography kept my eyes glued to the screen, and the script felt really Intelligent and Complex and despite people calling the writing confusing, I was able to piece it together with no problem whatsoever. This film is similar to Empire Strikes back in terms of popularity so over time after the other movies are released, this movie would probably be more popular.This film was way better than I Expected and deserves another chance.

"Its shame to see what critics and marvel fans did to this movie and targeted Zack Snyder for it. I have seen this movie more than 25 times till date. And i enjoy this movie as much as i enjoyed the first time. The fans who have read DC comics, wouldn't be disappointed in this movie. Its dark movie, yes it is. Because the title shows the intense situation at hand. Two superheroes about to rip each other apart for whatever reasons that brought them to this stage. Yes it had to be dark and intense.Only marvel can be stupid enough to show an alien invasion where humans are loosing the battle and the super heroes are cracking jokes while battles as if they are playing ping pong. a person playing Call of Duty game is more serious while playing than the marvel heroes fighting aliens."

"Last week some news came out from somebody online who had claimed to have seen a finished version of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. If you were like me, you've been leery of checking it out because you weren't sure how much might actually be true. Now Zack Snyder has spoken out about the spoiler-filled post, although his response doesn't really clear anything up.In a word, to MTV, he called the post \"hilarious,which might imply that he's saying that it's mostly, if not entirely, untrue. That might be the case, but then again he could have just said it was untrue and he didn't say that. What he did say, however, is that he doesn't like spoilers. While this may seem odd for the director who's most recent trailer appeared to give away the entire movie, Snyder says that's not the case. Even if you've seen the trailer, you can rest easy, as there is much more we have not seen in then finished film. Says Snyder I have the benefit of seeing the movie. It's cool that think it's too much, and I appreciate people not wanting to know, but there's plenty that they don't know. There's a lot of movie that's not in the trailer. In the process of calling the Batman v Superman Reddit review hilarious, Snyder goes on to talk about how he hates it when spoilers come out. The director would much rather that fans see the movie mostly blind. While he understands that some fans may wish to find the answers before hand, he wants his movies to be mysteries going in. If you're, as an audience member, exploring these articles, looking for answers to questions that you have, maybe you're okay with knowing before you go. It's like an individual taste. But like I said, I want people to see the movie without knowing.Spoilers are a topic that mean different things to different people. While most try to avoid them to some degree, the need to solve the mystery is a nearly universal human experience. We have an inclination to want to know the truth, even while also wanting to be surprised. For most of us getting some information is good, but getting all the information is bad, of course, only getting the details that you want can be difficult."
"The theatrical is choppy, poorly edited, hard to follow, with some really good moments mixed in their. The extended is much more fluent and is much easier to follow, it does have a long runtime, which might make it seem a bit dragging on, but if you like long films done right, like Lord of the Rings, you will like this movie as long as you get into the characters and story. Speaking of which, the story starts out perfectly showing Bruce Wayne as a character, and it is very powerful. There are several moments in this movie that are powerful, emotional, and shocking. Characters. Batman is my favorite fictional character of all time, and believe me when I say, Ben Affleck as Batman was perfect, he had the charisma, the anger, and the look of being through some bad stuff Gal Gadot also does perfect as Wonder Woman, but if you want to really see how good she does, go watch the Wonder Woman movie. Henry Call as Superman. I really don't like it when people say Christopher Reeves is better. Don't get me wrong, Reeves does great, but can you imagine him as Superman in this movie? I wouldn't like it. It would be like Adam West playing Batman in The Dark Knight. Henry Cavill does great in this role, I can say everything about him as I said with Ben Affleck. Jesse Eisenberg as Luthor. I thought it was different in a good way. I've heard a criticism for him as being too much like Joker, but is that a bad thing? Joker is my favorite villain, so to see Superman have an enemy that crazy, but still hold the values Luthor needs to be Luthor, I think it is great. The thing I thought this movie was lacking in the first and second acts was humor, at least good humor. If there was more humor, I would've given this movie a ten because it would give a more relaxing feel to the parts that needed it. All in all though, this movie was awesome, it had powerful moments, it was badass, and just plain fun. It had a great story arc and does its job very well."

"*I will be talking about the Ultimate Edition of the film* This was one of the most anticipated CBM of all time. Ever since the arrival and subsequent success of Marvel's The Avengers people have wondered when will DC launch its own cinematic universe, one of the main reasons being the opportunity to finally see titans such as Batman and Superman share the screen together: the ultimate nerd dream. On 2016, the moment finally came for BvS to be released AND.. it performed poorly. Not only did critical reception left a lot to be desired, but fan reactions where surprisingly split after its cinematic debut. People either loved it and called Zack a genius, or hated it and called him a hack. Me, personally, I found myself with middle of the road feelings, for sure, but more leaning towards the negative side with subsequent viewings. The theatrical cut of the film showcased amazing performances, incredible visuals, and action set pieces that seemed like comic book panels come to life, in a good way. However, when it comes to its narrative structure and more technical aspects like editing, the film was seriously flawed. More plot holes than Age of Ultron, questionable character decisions, random editing that lacked cohesion and focus, and forced dramatic moments that lacked any impact because the attempts at character development ranged from limited to nonexistent, especially when it comes to Superman's character. I thought it was a 5/10 movie at best. As such, I was kind of skeptical about the idea of a 30 minute longer version. I say kind of because I know how Zack works. I remember Watchmen being vastly improved with its director's cut, so in a way I was expecting BvS to perform in a similar manner, but I also feared those 30 minutes wold be just there to amplify action and discredit storytelling issues. Oh boy, I'm so glad I was proved wrong. The ultimate cut of the film was infuriating, but not because it was awful, but because it questions the sanity of WB executives and editors and makes you wonder what were they thinking during the editing process. What I got out of the Ultimate Edition was a thought-provoking deconstruction of two very iconic superheroes that gave spotlight to the struggles both of them face when they aren't fighting crime. What I got was an extremely well produced character study on both Batman and Superman in a cynical world, a world dangerously close to our own. We meet Batman as a ruthless, worn out hero that has seen the failure behind his ideals and witnessed some truly horrifying things in his life. Superman, on the other hand, is portrayed as a godlike figure that seeks to do good in the world, but finds himself emotionally conflicted once he realized that every good deed he does leaves behind a trail of destruction (most of it due to Luthor's antics). In my opinion, this is a hugely original approach, one that distances itself from the rest of the competition and delivers a dark, somber, yet relevant superhero movie that understands both characters and gives them real human struggles to deal with. I felt invested in both of them, and hoped that by the end of the film both could find a way to redeem themselves. Their character arcs were very well established during the first two acts of the movie, and by the time we get to the titular climactic battle the emotion behind the jaw-dropping action is intensified. Lex Luthor as a villain was also given more time to develop with this new edition. One of the main criticisms with the original version was the fact that his plan relied too much on conveniences, and the character's mannerisms and mad-scientist attitude was annoying, and that goes without saying his motivations were unclear. Not only do we spend more time understanding his hate for any godlike figure and thus his hatred for Superman, but the added scenes allowed us to witness his entire plan come to fruition. It sells the cold, manipulative, calculating attributes of his comic counterpart. The acting is spot on. Every actor owns his/her role, from Cavill's Superman, to Ben Affleck as Batman, Eisenberg as Luthor, and Gadot as Wonder Woman, whose scenes are brief, but are more than enough to sell the strong and ferocious warrior that she is. Cinematography is stunning, and miles above that of Man of Steel's. And the soundtrack by Zimmer and Junkie XL? Perfect, just perfect. When it comes to flaws, the film still has some of those. The Martha moment, while serving as a pivotal character moment for Batman, felt off in execution, and its understandable that many people got mad at it. If your main complaint about BvS the first time around was its bleak tone and subject matter, this film is still not for you. I understand most were expecting to see the heroes being the most iconic versions of themselves, clashing in an elongated battle and evoking the same feelings The Avengers gave audiences back in 2012. In that sense, the film will remain divisive, but at least I have the comfort of saying that, at the very least, the film is competently made."

"This film was amazing. Ben Affleck was easily the best part of this movie, he brought his a-game as Batman. The chemistry between Affleck & Irons was outstanding. Gal Gadot did a great job as Wonder Woman. The fight between Batman & Superman was awesome. The final fight with Doomsday was outstanding in every way possible. However, there is only one problem with this film and that's Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor. He was sadly missed cast in this role, but then again it's really the fault of Warner Bros. Studios. Overall, this film deliver on almost every level. I highly recommend that you watch the extended version of this film."

"I know I know. I saw it in theaters too, and felt like it could've been so much better. While the Batman element was good, the narrative felt fractured, and the third act was just one long stunt scene. Superman was relegated to a supporting character, and other characters didn't get a chance to shine. And then I chanced on the ultimate cut. Calling it 30 mins of \"extra\" footage is unfair to Zack Snyder because it's exactly these 30 mins that makes the movie a worthy one. What I can say about the theatrical cut is this - It had the blockbuster elements - music, visuals, stunts, CGI. But, it lacked the human elements. The first 20 mins of the movie had it, but not after that. The extended cut in comparison has a flow to the narrative. There are no disjointed scenes, everything flows smoothly, and there's connective tissue. Superman gets to spend some time with his father, and mother. Clark Kent does some investigative journalism. Superman helps the people after the blast. Lois Lane doesn't jump to conclusions, she gets to the bottom of the crime. Lex Luthor apparently had a coherent plan - everything is explained pretty well. Wonder Woman was already good, so there's no change there :) Also, the \"Martha\" scene seems better executed, because it is a few seconds longer, and there's time to breathe it in. So, here's my take on this movie - The theatrical cut was junk. Get the Bluray for ultimate edition, and you shall not be disappointed. I've seen it so many more times now, and it's the definitive cut. It is the movie we deserve. It's a unique take on Batman, and Superman. It's a gritty take on the superhero movie genre, and definitely the best DCEU movie, and the best DC movie since The Dark Knight.P.S. Yes it's dark. We're adults, and we should appreciate mature film making without intentionally silly moments. It attempts to be philosophical, and something deep instead of just trying to make you chuckle."

"This is one of the best superhero movies ever made. Zack Snyder is a magician behind the camera.The reason behind so many complaints is the fact that Warner Bros. marketed this movie as a fight between Batman and Superman. That's not what it is. It's a movie about the origins of the Justice League.The cinematography, the acting and the score are all second to none. This film is phenomenal.P.S: watch the 3 hour extended cut that Snyder intended you to see, not the 2 and a half hour movie that Warner Bros. decided would be better for theaters."

"I don't care what the critics say, this is a very well-done movie. I'll start my review by listing what I like about the movie.1.) Ben Affleck is the best batman to me and it is not close. He pulls off the role of an aging batman extremely well. Also, Zack Snyder's vision of batman is legit. I have always hated batman up until this adaptation of him. Instead of being a conflicted and idealistic batman, this batman is dark, gritty, and 100% a badass. His equipment is decked out with machine guns and he has no aversion to killing people. In fact, he probably kills about 50 criminal by the time this movie is over. The warehouse scene is the coolest batman scene in any movie.2.) The development of a grudge between batman and superman is pulled off flawlessly. It actually makes sense why batman dislikes superman. Then, when they do fight it is about the coolest thing you can expect to see from a superhero film. 3.) I disagree with a lot of people about Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor. In my opinion, he played his role to perfection. 4.) B v S sets up Wonder Woman and Justice League with Gal Gadot's cameo as Wonder Woman and short clips of Aquaman, the Flash, and Cyborg. B v S is one of my favorite superhero films and rewatching it never gets old."

"The theatrical cut of this film is garbage which is why I rated it eight stars instead of nine. The first time I watched this film I didn't like it (not straight out hate but didn't like). Character motivations didn't make any sense, Lex was annoying as s***, editing was sloppy, and it was overly dark and broody for an action superhero movie. A year + a half, five Marvel films, a ton of bad reviews and a Justice League later a thought popped into my head: \"what if I watched BVS again\". This time I didn't have trailers ruining the best moments, I only vaguely remembered the film, and I was conditioned to look at it negatively but something unexpected happened: I actually loved it. Superman was just a normal person that tried to make a difference cause he could that others imposed their own beliefs on. Lex Luthor was a genius that couldn't stand his powerlessness compared to Superman or more accurately a super being. As Alfred said \"The fever, the rage, the feeling of powerlessness that turns good men... cruel\" and you see the same thought process in Batman. Batman, just like Lex Luthor feels powerless in the midst of a god-being and just like Lex he attempts to destroy him so he can get his sense of power back but unlike Lex, Batman learns something. I what is one of the corniest lines of the movie Superman says, \"Martha\" when he knows he can't win against Batman in a late desperate attempt to save his mother. Not only does this name connect with Bruce Wayne but it also shows what really matters to a man of steel: it isn't power, it isn't fame or anything else, it is his Mother and on a broader scale it is people. Lex (who doesn't care about people at all) knows he doesn't have the power so he creates something from his blood and the remains of Zod: A Doomsday for Superman. Not only does this film have depth but it also doesn't always explain it to you which is rare in a blockbuster action superhero flick normally cater to semi-comic book fans and people that want to shove popcorn in their mouths. This film rewards you for really noticing the details while still having massive explosions. One of my favorites is how Lex has all of Batman's branded killed which is why he isn't afraid of the branding at the end or Grandma's Peach Tea as a way of scaring the s*** out of someone. Of course, this film isn't perfect and I do have personal dislikes. The Batman V Superman fight was slow and pretty boring especially after watching such an amazing fight in Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 2 (If you haven't watched the animated Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 1 and 2 you are sorely missing out on something fantastic). Also, the addition of Wonder Woman who pretty much steals a hacker thing, gives it back and then suits up and fights against a giant monster thing. Not to say I don't like Wonder Woman (She is one of my favorite Superheroes of all time who showed not only can woman kick a** but they also don't need to be ashamed of their sexuality or gender) but she wasn't really that helpful to the plot and just brought in to expand the universe which was well done through Lex's superhuman hunting files. Also, the post-apocalyptic scene that was just a dream could have been cut but nothing is perfect except movies like Citizen Kane which isn't a lot of fun to watch cause it is too perfect. So to summarize, the theatrical cut is bad, the ultimate cut is Amazing and the other cut is meh. Please give it a second chance because it deserves it and save a good director from losing grace because of something he didn't do."
"I really liked it, don't know what all the hate is about. I'm actually a Marvel fan from when I was 7 or so, but Superman and Batman together in 1 movie? Just great. And personally I like Ben Affleck even better than Christian Bale as Batman. So just watch and enjoy, I know I did!"

"That's right. We have been waiting for these two heroes to finally meet and fight against each other. This movie is so good in both plot and special effects.Henry Cavill and Ben Affleck have performed well in their acting stages. They are the best superhero actors and they have filmed their fighting scenes very well. The movie starts to show the conflict between the lives of the heroes and now they have blamed each other for it. This movie is amazing and sets up a good plot for Dawn Justice."

"Actually...I didn't know what to expect. When you see Wonder Woman, you know it will be off of Wonder Woman and off of a Wonder Woman story, but with Batman V Superman, I was like, \"hmmmm, so who is this about?\" It was pretty obvious that it would feature many characters, but I thought the introduction to Batman was amazing. Ben Affleck nailed the part, not only as Batman but also as Bruce Wayne. He is my Batman. Henry Cavill continued to be super as the Man of Steel. And he is my Super - Man. A dark story? Yes, without a doubt. Could it have had a few more jokes? Sure. But not all movies or stories need to have jokes when certain events are serious. I really hope people can see this review and take another look at the movie, because, I loved it. I really hope the ratings can go up, eventually. And P.S, this movie is the perfect set up to Justice League."

"I'll start by making it clear I have only ever seen the Ultimate Edition. I'm aware of what was cut out for the theatrical release, so I will concede up front that most of the criticisms about pacing, editing, and missing bits of plot at release were merited.With that caveat out of the way, I must reiterate that this was bar-none the boldest superhero movie I have ever seen. To me, it was arguably the best as well, though \"best\" shouldn't be taken to mean \"most enjoyable.\" That honor easily goes to \"Thor: Ragnarok.\" What makes BvS stand out among other films in the genre is that it takes two characters who have been done to death since the 1970s and brings them up to date. I recently tried to watch \"Superman: The Movie\" for the first time in a number of years, and while it was still good and Reeves will always be iconic, I just couldn't take it seriously. I'll put it this way: If the story in BvS was \"stupid\" in your view but Superman turning back time by spinning the earth backward on its axis didn't seem like one of the dumbest things you have ever seen -in any movie from any genre- to the extent that it outright ruins the movie for you, then your opinion about BvS isn't worth much. Nostalgic bias was always going to be a problem for this movie, and the way people reacted to and reviewed \"Man of Steel\" was telling in this regard.That brings me to Zack Snyder's take on Superman. You know, that guy whose status as the first extraterrestrial ever encountered by humanity was a total non-issue in the old movies. Apparently, Snyder has a similar view to my own in that his take on the Man of Steel makes his being an alien a core piece of his identity. He may look like any other (absurdly attractive) person, but he knows what he is, and that makes him perpetually uncertain of where he fits in this world. He is essentially good and really does care about people, but he struggles to truly empathize with the likes of us. To be human is to be frail, and that is not something he can easily relate to. This is the root of his conflict with Batman.Just as Clark struggles to genuinely relate to most people, Snyder's Batman either refuses to or otherwise just can't relate to Superman. He doesn't see him as anything but a threat regardless of Superman's clear good intentions. Remember, a small group of Kryptonians were able to bring humanity to the brink of extinction in less than a day, and Bruce Wayne is nothing if not a realist. He didn't know the guy from Kansas. He only knew the god from another world.While Batman's anger toward and fear of Superman are readily apparent from the start, Superman's inability to imagine things from Bruce Wayne's perspective only becomes truly apparent during their first real interaction. This reminded me of the animated version of the \"world's finest\" storyline, where Superman judges Batman harshly for using fear tactics and threats of violence (also, actual violence) to get the job done. Superman wasn't willing to consider what it would take for a human man to fight criminals and save innocents, or what that life would do to him over time. Just as Batman didn't see the guy from Kansas, Superman didn't see the man who lives his life trapped in one brutal, unthinkably traumatic moment (this was beautifully conveyed during the film's opening moments), and had spent his whole adult life bearing witness to humanity at its absolute worst.The conflict between these two characters is as old as human history. They want the same things, but they can't understand one another. So they fight. And what a fight it was.Watching a fight between, say, Captain America and Iron Man was, to me, more frustrating than anything because each understood the other's perspective perfectly. The fight between Batman and Superman in BvS was genuinely gut-wrenching, as intended, because they would have understood one another if either had tried. The whole sequence hilighted Batman's tactical prowess and ability to control a situation. Maybe the most badass thing about the fight was that it ended exactly where Batman planned. That brings me to the big elephant in the room named \"Martha.\"I can't recall exactly which YouTuber put it this way, but if you thought the \"save Martha\" exchange was about their mothers having the same name, you had your brain turned off. The brain-on people have explained this to death, but it bears repeating. This was the moment when Superman became humanized to Batman. He was about to die, and his only concern was for his adoptive human mother. He still believed that the man about to take his life would do the right thing. Even with the cowl on, there was no mistaking the look on Batman's face. It was the look of shame, guilt, and sudden uncertainty that says \"What am I doing?\" Turns out even the most brutal, angry version of Bruce Wayne is better than Tony Stark at knowing right from wrong. At knowing that he had gone too far.From there, the third act was a series of truly impressive (albeit mostly CGI) fight sequences, beginning with what I regard as the undisputed champion of Batman fights. Nothing in the Nolan movies (and especially nothing in the Burton movies) even came close. Go ahead, try to convince yourself that Batman and Bane taking turns punching one another in the face until Bane's mask broke was a good fight sequence. No, this was a fight straight out of \"Arkham Knight,\" and it was glorious. The battle against Doomsday really was one for the books. From the moment Wonder Woman arrived accompanied by the intense sounds of Tina Guo's electric cello to Superman's tragic, heroic death at the hands of Doomsday, I was glued to the screen. Sure, the mere presence of Doomsday spoiled the end to a degree, but watching the Man of Steel laboring to carry that kryptonite spear towards certain death was no less impactful. A brief word on Jesse Eisenberg's take on Lex Luthor. At least one other reviewer on this site already said it best when they pointed out that this was his origin story. If you consider his scheme objectively, he is actually one of the more formidable incarnations of the character. If we're lucky, we'll eventually get to see a Snyder Cut of \"Justice League\" and find out where this story was actually meant to go. For the record, Joss Whedon and Danny Elfman both should have said \"no\" to taking a dump on someone else's art."
"BATMAN V SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE brings a fantastic surprise to a smash-hit team-up with one of the worlds most beloved DC Comics' icons of all time. The movie delivers spectacular casting, and fantastic acting with different characters having their shine in each scenes.The story follows Clark Kent/Superman who becomes a threat, after the destruction in Metropolis in Man Of Steel.(2013). Batman/Bruce Wayne sees him as a threat and begins his war on Superman.The movie brings spectacular storytelling, it tells the complications of human against alien who are on the same side, and the first meeting of Batman and Superman. The story of Bruce Wayne, with his many years of The Caped Crusader, sends him on a spiral of \"out of control\", sheer anger, and builds tension to wanting to defeat the Man of Steel. Snyder has fantastically gave this storytelling an exciting nod to the comics.Lex Luthor, played by Jesse Einsberg, delivers a very interesting performance, but very differently by him showing is his \"origin\" before he becomes a bald foe to the Man of Steel. He shows that his love of \"god vs man\" terrorises mankind when he ultimately creates Doomsday, and Batman realises Superman's inner heroism.It packs so many great \"out of nowhere\" excitement, including a first-look of the fearful Wonder Woman a.k.a. Diana Prince, played by Gal Gadot, and a fresh-new glimpse of the superhero DC canon: The Justice League.WATCH THIS MOVIE! The critics are out of their mind. It's a fun-packed action adventure which still keeps the movie enjoyable until it's final minutes of the movie. It's a FANTASTIC MOVIE! BEN AFFLECK AS BATMAN... is Incredible!A 10/10 overall!"
"I want to go on record as saying that this is a truly thrilling cinematic experience in so many ways. If pressed, I guess I could acknowledge that there were a couple ... let's say \"clumsy\" moments. And in a film that runs to three hours, that hardly seems like a significant issue, certainly not enough to rate it with fewer than 9 stars.This film has everything. There is dramatic tension right from the start. There is a magnificent story arc that picks up quite seamlessly from 'Man of Steel' and propels the viewer not only into the life of Clark Kent/Superman but also of Bruce Wayne/Batman.The villain is no mere cartoon of a villain; he is truly thoroughly (and apparently irrevocably) diabolical. He is a psychopath, and you wish for his death over and over and over. You want Superman to reduce him to ash with the power of his eyes.I have read a number of viewers' reviews, and it seems that the people who disliked the film / gave it a low rating had rather unfair and unrealistic expectations of it. That is, their own prejudices about how the plot could/should unfold or what the character development could/should be, etc. ruined the film for them. And that is a shame.My thought is: I settle into my seat, wait for the lights to dim, and then I wait to be transported by the film. I accept it, lock, stock, and barrel.As another reviewer remarked, I love how the film begins from the point of view of Bruce Wayne as he is among people on the ground who have fallen victim to the attack of Zod and the other Kryptonians.Why would Bruce Wayne not like Superman? Why would the good people of Earth hurl insults at Superman and burn him in effigy (on the news)? Because the good people of Earth just got catapulted into a new reality in which there are not only extraterrestrial beings (surprise!) but they are also superman! And a group of them are hell-bent on destroying humankind and taking the planet for themselves.It is difficult to see Superman as separate from the whole Kryptonian Krew.It seems that many moviegoers forgot that Bruce Wayne is also human. Sure, he's a hero, but he is flawed.. Just like the rest of us. He is a vigilante, after all.He has let his vigilantism get the better of him. HE is actually the one working outside the boundaries of the law, not Superman. It is the clear head of Alfred that shows us that he has gone into a rather dark place, that he has not seen what is really going on (in Luthor's scheme), and so he chooses to embark on his own scheme scheme to take out the alien invader. He is (allegedly) thinking of the future: if he wipes out the all-powerful alien, then it can't turn on humankind in the future. At least, he convinces himself of that.A philosophical question is raised in the film: should Clark Kent have remained a simple man from Kansas and never have become the Superman? Should he just let people die and let calamities happen? The question is answered for us in the character of Diana Prince/Wonder Woman. She withdrew from mankind (her exact words) and just sat around watching. Watching while people died horrible deaths all around her. So, should Superman have done the same? Do these special beings, these 'metahumans', have some kind of moral imperative to intervene, or should they be allowed to be regular people, too? It seems that humans want it both ways.It seems that humans are saying: \"Don't be a superalien ... except when I and my friends and family are in trouble. Then come save us.\""

"Batman v Superman: Ultimate Edition: If your looking for a quick, cheap thrill then you might not enjoy this film at the time. This movies theatrical version was butchered by WB and in doing so reshaped the story leaving numerous plot holes. So the Ultimate Edition is the full story and the one worth seeing. Watch 'Man of Steel' before seeing this movie. There is much to claw through here, so much so that the audience might easily find themselves exhausted from the overall aggression of the film. However, a lot of the story does work. The action is good, and the emotion feels real most of the time.This film is about Superman trying to become Superman. Trying to help the world, save people, find a place in this world not as an outcast, and yet is looked at has a threat by many. Superman is not from this world, yet He is trying to be human, find a place in this world, be excepted by earths people, and come into his destiny.This film is also about Batman being Batman for 20 years and losing faith in humanity, and fearing Superman, what Superman can do with his powers. Great film, great plot, great visuals. ---Yidioo"
"I didn't see the film in the theaters and just bought the \"Extended Edition \" on Amazon. I never properly saw Man of Steel- i think I rented it and watched it when already exhausted and fell asleep. I saw the mediocre user reviews and horrible reviews from critics of this film.They really have it wrong. This is the very best either Batman or Superman. It has a different take, on things. Much darker then earlier films even darker then the Christopher Nolan Batman films.First of all Christopher Nolan is an Executive Producer. So how bad could it be? I loved Sucker Punch and Zack Snyder was involved with that. So how bad could this be? Hans Zimmer did the music, so how bad could it be?I remember watching the old Superman TV shows and reading the Superman and Batman comics as a little kid and loved them, but i wouldn't call myself a \"fan boy\" of comic universes, like so many younger people today. As an older adult I will admit my favorite TV show of all time was Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but watched it on DVD only after it had finished. I saw the second of the Dark Knight series in the theater, but the other two, I watched on DVD. They were great, but not my favorite films like so many people. i also loved the first couple Superman and Batman films in the older series. Regardless, i was not waiting with baited breath to see Man of Steel or this one.I'm more of a serious film fan, who can watch Stanley Kubrick films over and over and my favorite films in the last twenty years, are Eyes Wide Shut and Intersteller, both of which i've watched multiple times.So, with that said, take it from me, the critics have this film very wrong, just as critics hated 2001: A Space Odyssey when it first came out. This film will have lasting appreciation.Surprised how much I liked Ben Afleck's Batman. it was hard to get into Henry Cavil's scrawnier looking Superman, but it grew on me. Amy Adams was great as Lois Lane, The Gal Gadol Wonder Women was amazing. Lex Luther was terrific, like Nolan's Joker. Jeremy Irons was the best Alfred ever. Holly Hunter and Diane Lane was good too. The movie had bad reviews but made a billion dollars. Hopefully everyone buys the Ultimate Edition and it breaks sales records and the film is re-appreciated. I have no idea what scenes this Ultimate Edition added, but it is pretty perfect. Now I can't wait for Wonder Woman and the Justice League and as soon as I finish writing this am going to watch Man of Steal. I'm into it now!I can only surmise that the bad reviews stem from too much expectations of the rigid fan boy types and the radical changes in tone, we see in this film.Total masterpiece of cinema, but I have a few criticisms. There are a few hollow scenes of typical Idiot cops and authorities getting everything wrong in a cliché type way and it has a few filler scenes of that type and a few moments here and there that felt rushed and cheesy. Maybe not everything restored into the Ultimate Edition should have been. I wish there had been more Kevin Costner scenes."

"The whole entire Batman V Superman movie was great and yes even though it felt slow to the majority of the people who watched it but to me I enjoyed every part and every scene of Batman V Superman and when it got to the fight scenes both batman VS Superman and the Doomsday fight it brought so much drama, intensity, and epic performances. So with that being said I give this movie a good 10/10 because it really did go to my expectations and it brought a powerful performance and a powerful yet epic introduction to the upcoming Justice League."

"Zack Snyder not only understands the characters but he also understands how to craft a real amazing movie for fans - honestly blew me away (extended cut) Brilliant!Don't believe what the internet is telling you to think - take this from a person who has worked in the comic book industry - this is amazing!"

"When I first wrote a review for this movie a year ago exclaiming my excitement for the film, I had been high off a fresh dose of live-action DC superheroes playing out the beloved comic book stories that I had grown up on. It was all playing out before my eyes and coming to life. After a few months had passed, I began to notice things about the movie that I disliked: little gaps in the story, things that didn't add up, etc. My original rating of a 10 / 10 dropped to an 8 /10. But today it has gone back up to a 10. The extended version of the film not only rectifies the gaps but also silences critics.Many claimed that the movie was too dark or that it just didn't make sense. To those people, I say: \"Pick up a comic book!\" Many of the critics of this particular film were part of the superhero bandwagon that formed when Marvel began its spree of Avengers-related films. In fact, its estimated that over 60% of people who go to see 'superhero' genre films have never picked up a comic book in their life. I would argue that similar numbers could figure to those which view the CW televised DC Universe shows. People complain that DC comics is just too dark but the fact is that these movies are based upon actual comics which are meant to be dark (ex: The Dark Knight Returns, Injustice, etc.). Its like complaining that Game of Thrones (the TV series) sucks because they kill off too many characters. Read the books! Its frustrating to see such a beautiful work of art like Batman V Superman criticized by those ignorant to its universe and its meaning. This movie is in fact a catalyst that opens numerous doorways and leaves true fans in awe of the possibilities for future movies. But regardless of whether or not people choose to educate themselves, this film's DVD/Blu-ray extended version puts the theater release to shame. All of the plot holes and gaps are filled in 30 minutes of extended footage scattered throughout the film. The movie ultimately becomes more complete and people will wish that the movie had shown the full 3 hours of footage in its theatrical debut. As a major DC comics fan, I will of course pick up on things that a comics fan would not, but someone who does not read comics would learn to appreciate this film in its entirety with the extended version. Get your hands on a copy today or find it on Netflix or the internet somewhere!"

"I ignored the bad reviews and watched anyways. This film had a lot to live up to after Civil War was released and I went into this film expecting the worst. It ended up to be the best Superhero film of 2016 to me. One complaint was that this film was more concerned about universe building than telling a great story than Civil War but for me it was the other way around; Civil War felt like a build up to something else and to be honest, I felt that way when I saw the other MCU films. Batman vs Superman however not only had a great story, but it also felt a lot more consistent than Civil War. This film was way more diverse with the cast than the MCU but unlike the MCU, I felt like this film doesn't go overboard with the SJW stuff like the MCU films or The Star Wars Sequel films do. The Visuals were AMAZING, The Score by Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL was AMAZING as well, The Tone is just right as I actually felt for the characters emotionally, The Cinematography kept my eyes glued to the screen, and the script felt really Intelligent and Complex and despite people calling the writing confusing, I was able to piece it together with no problem whatsoever. This film is similar to Empire Strikes back in terms of popularity so over time after the other movies are released, this movie would probably be more popular.This film was way better than I Expected and deserves another chance.

"Its shame to see what critics and marvel fans did to this movie and targeted Zack Snyder for it. I have seen this movie more than 25 times till date. And i enjoy this movie as much as i enjoyed the first time. The fans who have read DC comics, wouldn't be disappointed in this movie. Its dark movie, yes it is. Because the title shows the intense situation at hand. Two superheroes about to rip each other apart for whatever reasons that brought them to this stage. Yes it had to be dark and intense.Only marvel can be stupid enough to show an alien invasion where humans are loosing the battle and the super heroes are cracking jokes while battles as if they are playing ping pong. a person playing Call of Duty game is more serious while playing than the marvel heroes fighting aliens."

"Last week some news came out from somebody online who had claimed to have seen a finished version of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. If you were like me, you've been leery of checking it out because you weren't sure how much might actually be true. Now Zack Snyder has spoken out about the spoiler-filled post, although his response doesn't really clear anything up.In a word, to MTV, he called the post \"hilarious,which might imply that he's saying that it's mostly, if not entirely, untrue. That might be the case, but then again he could have just said it was untrue and he didn't say that. What he did say, however, is that he doesn't like spoilers. While this may seem odd for the director who's most recent trailer appeared to give away the entire movie, Snyder says that's not the case. Even if you've seen the trailer, you can rest easy, as there is much more we have not seen in then finished film. Says Snyder I have the benefit of seeing the movie. It's cool that think it's too much, and I appreciate people not wanting to know, but there's plenty that they don't know. There's a lot of movie that's not in the trailer. In the process of calling the Batman v Superman Reddit review hilarious, Snyder goes on to talk about how he hates it when spoilers come out. The director would much rather that fans see the movie mostly blind. While he understands that some fans may wish to find the answers before hand, he wants his movies to be mysteries going in. If you're, as an audience member, exploring these articles, looking for answers to questions that you have, maybe you're okay with knowing before you go. It's like an individual taste. But like I said, I want people to see the movie without knowing.Spoilers are a topic that mean different things to different people. While most try to avoid them to some degree, the need to solve the mystery is a nearly universal human experience. We have an inclination to want to know the truth, even while also wanting to be surprised. For most of us getting some information is good, but getting all the information is bad, of course, only getting the details that you want can be difficult."
"The theatrical is choppy, poorly edited, hard to follow, with some really good moments mixed in their. The extended is much more fluent and is much easier to follow, it does have a long runtime, which might make it seem a bit dragging on, but if you like long films done right, like Lord of the Rings, you will like this movie as long as you get into the characters and story. Speaking of which, the story starts out perfectly showing Bruce Wayne as a character, and it is very powerful. There are several moments in this movie that are powerful, emotional, and shocking. Characters. Batman is my favorite fictional character of all time, and believe me when I say, Ben Affleck as Batman was perfect, he had the charisma, the anger, and the look of being through some bad stuff Gal Gadot also does perfect as Wonder Woman, but if you want to really see how good she does, go watch the Wonder Woman movie. Henry Call as Superman. I really don't like it when people say Christopher Reeves is better. Don't get me wrong, Reeves does great, but can you imagine him as Superman in this movie? I wouldn't like it. It would be like Adam West playing Batman in The Dark Knight. Henry Cavill does great in this role, I can say everything about him as I said with Ben Affleck. Jesse Eisenberg as Luthor. I thought it was different in a good way. I've heard a criticism for him as being too much like Joker, but is that a bad thing? Joker is my favorite villain, so to see Superman have an enemy that crazy, but still hold the values Luthor needs to be Luthor, I think it is great. The thing I thought this movie was lacking in the first and second acts was humor, at least good humor. If there was more humor, I would've given this movie a ten because it would give a more relaxing feel to the parts that needed it. All in all though, this movie was awesome, it had powerful moments, it was badass, and just plain fun. It had a great story arc and does its job very well."

"*I will be talking about the Ultimate Edition of the film* This was one of the most anticipated CBM of all time. Ever since the arrival and subsequent success of Marvel's The Avengers people have wondered when will DC launch its own cinematic universe, one of the main reasons being the opportunity to finally see titans such as Batman and Superman share the screen together: the ultimate nerd dream. On 2016, the moment finally came for BvS to be released AND.. it performed poorly. Not only did critical reception left a lot to be desired, but fan reactions where surprisingly split after its cinematic debut. People either loved it and called Zack a genius, or hated it and called him a hack. Me, personally, I found myself with middle of the road feelings, for sure, but more leaning towards the negative side with subsequent viewings. The theatrical cut of the film showcased amazing performances, incredible visuals, and action set pieces that seemed like comic book panels come to life, in a good way. However, when it comes to its narrative structure and more technical aspects like editing, the film was seriously flawed. More plot holes than Age of Ultron, questionable character decisions, random editing that lacked cohesion and focus, and forced dramatic moments that lacked any impact because the attempts at character development ranged from limited to nonexistent, especially when it comes to Superman's character. I thought it was a 5/10 movie at best. As such, I was kind of skeptical about the idea of a 30 minute longer version. I say kind of because I know how Zack works. I remember Watchmen being vastly improved with its director's cut, so in a way I was expecting BvS to perform in a similar manner, but I also feared those 30 minutes wold be just there to amplify action and discredit storytelling issues. Oh boy, I'm so glad I was proved wrong. The ultimate cut of the film was infuriating, but not because it was awful, but because it questions the sanity of WB executives and editors and makes you wonder what were they thinking during the editing process. What I got out of the Ultimate Edition was a thought-provoking deconstruction of two very iconic superheroes that gave spotlight to the struggles both of them face when they aren't fighting crime. What I got was an extremely well produced character study on both Batman and Superman in a cynical world, a world dangerously close to our own. We meet Batman as a ruthless, worn out hero that has seen the failure behind his ideals and witnessed some truly horrifying things in his life. Superman, on the other hand, is portrayed as a godlike figure that seeks to do good in the world, but finds himself emotionally conflicted once he realized that every good deed he does leaves behind a trail of destruction (most of it due to Luthor's antics). In my opinion, this is a hugely original approach, one that distances itself from the rest of the competition and delivers a dark, somber, yet relevant superhero movie that understands both characters and gives them real human struggles to deal with. I felt invested in both of them, and hoped that by the end of the film both could find a way to redeem themselves. Their character arcs were very well established during the first two acts of the movie, and by the time we get to the titular climactic battle the emotion behind the jaw-dropping action is intensified. Lex Luthor as a villain was also given more time to develop with this new edition. One of the main criticisms with the original version was the fact that his plan relied too much on conveniences, and the character's mannerisms and mad-scientist attitude was annoying, and that goes without saying his motivations were unclear. Not only do we spend more time understanding his hate for any godlike figure and thus his hatred for Superman, but the added scenes allowed us to witness his entire plan come to fruition. It sells the cold, manipulative, calculating attributes of his comic counterpart. The acting is spot on. Every actor owns his/her role, from Cavill's Superman, to Ben Affleck as Batman, Eisenberg as Luthor, and Gadot as Wonder Woman, whose scenes are brief, but are more than enough to sell the strong and ferocious warrior that she is. Cinematography is stunning, and miles above that of Man of Steel's. And the soundtrack by Zimmer and Junkie XL? Perfect, just perfect. When it comes to flaws, the film still has some of those. The Martha moment, while serving as a pivotal character moment for Batman, felt off in execution, and its understandable that many people got mad at it. If your main complaint about BvS the first time around was its bleak tone and subject matter, this film is still not for you. I understand most were expecting to see the heroes being the most iconic versions of themselves, clashing in an elongated battle and evoking the same feelings The Avengers gave audiences back in 2012. In that sense, the film will remain divisive, but at least I have the comfort of saying that, at the very least, the film is competently made."

"This film was amazing. Ben Affleck was easily the best part of this movie, he brought his a-game as Batman. The chemistry between Affleck & Irons was outstanding. Gal Gadot did a great job as Wonder Woman. The fight between Batman & Superman was awesome. The final fight with Doomsday was outstanding in every way possible. However, there is only one problem with this film and that's Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor. He was sadly missed cast in this role, but then again it's really the fault of Warner Bros. Studios. Overall, this film deliver on almost every level. I highly recommend that you watch the extended version of this film."

"I know I know. I saw it in theaters too, and felt like it could've been so much better. While the Batman element was good, the narrative felt fractured, and the third act was just one long stunt scene. Superman was relegated to a supporting character, and other characters didn't get a chance to shine. And then I chanced on the ultimate cut. Calling it 30 mins of \"extra\" footage is unfair to Zack Snyder because it's exactly these 30 mins that makes the movie a worthy one. What I can say about the theatrical cut is this - It had the blockbuster elements - music, visuals, stunts, CGI. But, it lacked the human elements. The first 20 mins of the movie had it, but not after that. The extended cut in comparison has a flow to the narrative. There are no disjointed scenes, everything flows smoothly, and there's connective tissue. Superman gets to spend some time with his father, and mother. Clark Kent does some investigative journalism. Superman helps the people after the blast. Lois Lane doesn't jump to conclusions, she gets to the bottom of the crime. Lex Luthor apparently had a coherent plan - everything is explained pretty well. Wonder Woman was already good, so there's no change there :) Also, the \"Martha\" scene seems better executed, because it is a few seconds longer, and there's time to breathe it in. So, here's my take on this movie - The theatrical cut was junk. Get the Bluray for ultimate edition, and you shall not be disappointed. I've seen it so many more times now, and it's the definitive cut. It is the movie we deserve. It's a unique take on Batman, and Superman. It's a gritty take on the superhero movie genre, and definitely the best DCEU movie, and the best DC movie since The Dark Knight.P.S. Yes it's dark. We're adults, and we should appreciate mature film making without intentionally silly moments. It attempts to be philosophical, and something deep instead of just trying to make you chuckle."

"This is one of the best superhero movies ever made. Zack Snyder is a magician behind the camera.The reason behind so many complaints is the fact that Warner Bros. marketed this movie as a fight between Batman and Superman. That's not what it is. It's a movie about the origins of the Justice League.The cinematography, the acting and the score are all second to none. This film is phenomenal.P.S: watch the 3 hour extended cut that Snyder intended you to see, not the 2 and a half hour movie that Warner Bros. decided would be better for theaters."

"I don't care what the critics say, this is a very well-done movie. I'll start my review by listing what I like about the movie.1.) Ben Affleck is the best batman to me and it is not close. He pulls off the role of an aging batman extremely well. Also, Zack Snyder's vision of batman is legit. I have always hated batman up until this adaptation of him. Instead of being a conflicted and idealistic batman, this batman is dark, gritty, and 100% a badass. His equipment is decked out with machine guns and he has no aversion to killing people. In fact, he probably kills about 50 criminal by the time this movie is over. The warehouse scene is the coolest batman scene in any movie.2.) The development of a grudge between batman and superman is pulled off flawlessly. It actually makes sense why batman dislikes superman. Then, when they do fight it is about the coolest thing you can expect to see from a superhero film. 3.) I disagree with a lot of people about Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor. In my opinion, he played his role to perfection. 4.) B v S sets up Wonder Woman and Justice League with Gal Gadot's cameo as Wonder Woman and short clips of Aquaman, the Flash, and Cyborg. B v S is one of my favorite superhero films and rewatching it never gets old."

"The theatrical cut of this film is garbage which is why I rated it eight stars instead of nine. The first time I watched this film I didn't like it (not straight out hate but didn't like). Character motivations didn't make any sense, Lex was annoying as s***, editing was sloppy, and it was overly dark and broody for an action superhero movie. A year + a half, five Marvel films, a ton of bad reviews and a Justice League later a thought popped into my head: \"what if I watched BVS again\". This time I didn't have trailers ruining the best moments, I only vaguely remembered the film, and I was conditioned to look at it negatively but something unexpected happened: I actually loved it. Superman was just a normal person that tried to make a difference cause he could that others imposed their own beliefs on. Lex Luthor was a genius that couldn't stand his powerlessness compared to Superman or more accurately a super being. As Alfred said \"The fever, the rage, the feeling of powerlessness that turns good men... cruel\" and you see the same thought process in Batman. Batman, just like Lex Luthor feels powerless in the midst of a god-being and just like Lex he attempts to destroy him so he can get his sense of power back but unlike Lex, Batman learns something. I what is one of the corniest lines of the movie Superman says, \"Martha\" when he knows he can't win against Batman in a late desperate attempt to save his mother. Not only does this name connect with Bruce Wayne but it also shows what really matters to a man of steel: it isn't power, it isn't fame or anything else, it is his Mother and on a broader scale it is people. Lex (who doesn't care about people at all) knows he doesn't have the power so he creates something from his blood and the remains of Zod: A Doomsday for Superman. Not only does this film have depth but it also doesn't always explain it to you which is rare in a blockbuster action superhero flick normally cater to semi-comic book fans and people that want to shove popcorn in their mouths. This film rewards you for really noticing the details while still having massive explosions. One of my favorites is how Lex has all of Batman's branded killed which is why he isn't afraid of the branding at the end or Grandma's Peach Tea as a way of scaring the s*** out of someone. Of course, this film isn't perfect and I do have personal dislikes. The Batman V Superman fight was slow and pretty boring especially after watching such an amazing fight in Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 2 (If you haven't watched the animated Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 1 and 2 you are sorely missing out on something fantastic). Also, the addition of Wonder Woman who pretty much steals a hacker thing, gives it back and then suits up and fights against a giant monster thing. Not to say I don't like Wonder Woman (She is one of my favorite Superheroes of all time who showed not only can woman kick a** but they also don't need to be ashamed of their sexuality or gender) but she wasn't really that helpful to the plot and just brought in to expand the universe which was well done through Lex's superhuman hunting files. Also, the post-apocalyptic scene that was just a dream could have been cut but nothing is perfect except movies like Citizen Kane which isn't a lot of fun to watch cause it is too perfect. So to summarize, the theatrical cut is bad, the ultimate cut is Amazing and the other cut is meh. Please give it a second chance because it deserves it and save a good director from losing grace because of something he didn't do."
"I really liked it, don't know what all the hate is about. I'm actually a Marvel fan from when I was 7 or so, but Superman and Batman together in 1 movie? Just great. And personally I like Ben Affleck even better than Christian Bale as Batman. So just watch and enjoy, I know I did!"

"That's right. We have been waiting for these two heroes to finally meet and fight against each other. This movie is so good in both plot and special effects.Henry Cavill and Ben Affleck have performed well in their acting stages. They are the best superhero actors and they have filmed their fighting scenes very well. The movie starts to show the conflict between the lives of the heroes and now they have blamed each other for it. This movie is amazing and sets up a good plot for Dawn Justice."

"Actually...I didn't know what to expect. When you see Wonder Woman, you know it will be off of Wonder Woman and off of a Wonder Woman story, but with Batman V Superman, I was like, \"hmmmm, so who is this about?\" It was pretty obvious that it would feature many characters, but I thought the introduction to Batman was amazing. Ben Affleck nailed the part, not only as Batman but also as Bruce Wayne. He is my Batman. Henry Cavill continued to be super as the Man of Steel. And he is my Super - Man. A dark story? Yes, without a doubt. Could it have had a few more jokes? Sure. But not all movies or stories need to have jokes when certain events are serious. I really hope people can see this review and take another look at the movie, because, I loved it. I really hope the ratings can go up, eventually. And P.S, this movie is the perfect set up to Justice League."

"I'll start by making it clear I have only ever seen the Ultimate Edition. I'm aware of what was cut out for the theatrical release, so I will concede up front that most of the criticisms about pacing, editing, and missing bits of plot at release were merited.With that caveat out of the way, I must reiterate that this was bar-none the boldest superhero movie I have ever seen. To me, it was arguably the best as well, though \"best\" shouldn't be taken to mean \"most enjoyable.\" That honor easily goes to \"Thor: Ragnarok.\" What makes BvS stand out among other films in the genre is that it takes two characters who have been done to death since the 1970s and brings them up to date. I recently tried to watch \"Superman: The Movie\" for the first time in a number of years, and while it was still good and Reeves will always be iconic, I just couldn't take it seriously. I'll put it this way: If the story in BvS was \"stupid\" in your view but Superman turning back time by spinning the earth backward on its axis didn't seem like one of the dumbest things you have ever seen -in any movie from any genre- to the extent that it outright ruins the movie for you, then your opinion about BvS isn't worth much. Nostalgic bias was always going to be a problem for this movie, and the way people reacted to and reviewed \"Man of Steel\" was telling in this regard.That brings me to Zack Snyder's take on Superman. You know, that guy whose status as the first extraterrestrial ever encountered by humanity was a total non-issue in the old movies. Apparently, Snyder has a similar view to my own in that his take on the Man of Steel makes his being an alien a core piece of his identity. He may look like any other (absurdly attractive) person, but he knows what he is, and that makes him perpetually uncertain of where he fits in this world. He is essentially good and really does care about people, but he struggles to truly empathize with the likes of us. To be human is to be frail, and that is not something he can easily relate to. This is the root of his conflict with Batman.Just as Clark struggles to genuinely relate to most people, Snyder's Batman either refuses to or otherwise just can't relate to Superman. He doesn't see him as anything but a threat regardless of Superman's clear good intentions. Remember, a small group of Kryptonians were able to bring humanity to the brink of extinction in less than a day, and Bruce Wayne is nothing if not a realist. He didn't know the guy from Kansas. He only knew the god from another world.While Batman's anger toward and fear of Superman are readily apparent from the start, Superman's inability to imagine things from Bruce Wayne's perspective only becomes truly apparent during their first real interaction. This reminded me of the animated version of the \"world's finest\" storyline, where Superman judges Batman harshly for using fear tactics and threats of violence (also, actual violence) to get the job done. Superman wasn't willing to consider what it would take for a human man to fight criminals and save innocents, or what that life would do to him over time. Just as Batman didn't see the guy from Kansas, Superman didn't see the man who lives his life trapped in one brutal, unthinkably traumatic moment (this was beautifully conveyed during the film's opening moments), and had spent his whole adult life bearing witness to humanity at its absolute worst.The conflict between these two characters is as old as human history. They want the same things, but they can't understand one another. So they fight. And what a fight it was.Watching a fight between, say, Captain America and Iron Man was, to me, more frustrating than anything because each understood the other's perspective perfectly. The fight between Batman and Superman in BvS was genuinely gut-wrenching, as intended, because they would have understood one another if either had tried. The whole sequence hilighted Batman's tactical prowess and ability to control a situation. Maybe the most badass thing about the fight was that it ended exactly where Batman planned. That brings me to the big elephant in the room named \"Martha.\"I can't recall exactly which YouTuber put it this way, but if you thought the \"save Martha\" exchange was about their mothers having the same name, you had your brain turned off. The brain-on people have explained this to death, but it bears repeating. This was the moment when Superman became humanized to Batman. He was about to die, and his only concern was for his adoptive human mother. He still believed that the man about to take his life would do the right thing. Even with the cowl on, there was no mistaking the look on Batman's face. It was the look of shame, guilt, and sudden uncertainty that says \"What am I doing?\" Turns out even the most brutal, angry version of Bruce Wayne is better than Tony Stark at knowing right from wrong. At knowing that he had gone too far.From there, the third act was a series of truly impressive (albeit mostly CGI) fight sequences, beginning with what I regard as the undisputed champion of Batman fights. Nothing in the Nolan movies (and especially nothing in the Burton movies) even came close. Go ahead, try to convince yourself that Batman and Bane taking turns punching one another in the face until Bane's mask broke was a good fight sequence. No, this was a fight straight out of \"Arkham Knight,\" and it was glorious. The battle against Doomsday really was one for the books. From the moment Wonder Woman arrived accompanied by the intense sounds of Tina Guo's electric cello to Superman's tragic, heroic death at the hands of Doomsday, I was glued to the screen. Sure, the mere presence of Doomsday spoiled the end to a degree, but watching the Man of Steel laboring to carry that kryptonite spear towards certain death was no less impactful. A brief word on Jesse Eisenberg's take on Lex Luthor. At least one other reviewer on this site already said it best when they pointed out that this was his origin story. If you consider his scheme objectively, he is actually one of the more formidable incarnations of the character. If we're lucky, we'll eventually get to see a Snyder Cut of \"Justice League\" and find out where this story was actually meant to go. For the record, Joss Whedon and Danny Elfman both should have said \"no\" to taking a dump on someone else's art."
"BATMAN V SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE brings a fantastic surprise to a smash-hit team-up with one of the worlds most beloved DC Comics' icons of all time. The movie delivers spectacular casting, and fantastic acting with different characters having their shine in each scenes.The story follows Clark Kent/Superman who becomes a threat, after the destruction in Metropolis in Man Of Steel.(2013). Batman/Bruce Wayne sees him as a threat and begins his war on Superman.The movie brings spectacular storytelling, it tells the complications of human against alien who are on the same side, and the first meeting of Batman and Superman. The story of Bruce Wayne, with his many years of The Caped Crusader, sends him on a spiral of \"out of control\", sheer anger, and builds tension to wanting to defeat the Man of Steel. Snyder has fantastically gave this storytelling an exciting nod to the comics.Lex Luthor, played by Jesse Einsberg, delivers a very interesting performance, but very differently by him showing is his \"origin\" before he becomes a bald foe to the Man of Steel. He shows that his love of \"god vs man\" terrorises mankind when he ultimately creates Doomsday, and Batman realises Superman's inner heroism.It packs so many great \"out of nowhere\" excitement, including a first-look of the fearful Wonder Woman a.k.a. Diana Prince, played by Gal Gadot, and a fresh-new glimpse of the superhero DC canon: The Justice League.WATCH THIS MOVIE! The critics are out of their mind. It's a fun-packed action adventure which still keeps the movie enjoyable until it's final minutes of the movie. It's a FANTASTIC MOVIE! BEN AFFLECK AS BATMAN... is Incredible!A 10/10 overall!"
"I want to go on record as saying that this is a truly thrilling cinematic experience in so many ways. If pressed, I guess I could acknowledge that there were a couple ... let's say \"clumsy\" moments. And in a film that runs to three hours, that hardly seems like a significant issue, certainly not enough to rate it with fewer than 9 stars.This film has everything. There is dramatic tension right from the start. There is a magnificent story arc that picks up quite seamlessly from 'Man of Steel' and propels the viewer not only into the life of Clark Kent/Superman but also of Bruce Wayne/Batman.The villain is no mere cartoon of a villain; he is truly thoroughly (and apparently irrevocably) diabolical. He is a psychopath, and you wish for his death over and over and over. You want Superman to reduce him to ash with the power of his eyes.I have read a number of viewers' reviews, and it seems that the people who disliked the film / gave it a low rating had rather unfair and unrealistic expectations of it. That is, their own prejudices about how the plot could/should unfold or what the character development could/should be, etc. ruined the film for them. And that is a shame.My thought is: I settle into my seat, wait for the lights to dim, and then I wait to be transported by the film. I accept it, lock, stock, and barrel.As another reviewer remarked, I love how the film begins from the point of view of Bruce Wayne as he is among people on the ground who have fallen victim to the attack of Zod and the other Kryptonians.Why would Bruce Wayne not like Superman? Why would the good people of Earth hurl insults at Superman and burn him in effigy (on the news)? Because the good people of Earth just got catapulted into a new reality in which there are not only extraterrestrial beings (surprise!) but they are also superman! And a group of them are hell-bent on destroying humankind and taking the planet for themselves.It is difficult to see Superman as separate from the whole Kryptonian Krew.It seems that many moviegoers forgot that Bruce Wayne is also human. Sure, he's a hero, but he is flawed.. Just like the rest of us. He is a vigilante, after all.He has let his vigilantism get the better of him. HE is actually the one working outside the boundaries of the law, not Superman. It is the clear head of Alfred that shows us that he has gone into a rather dark place, that he has not seen what is really going on (in Luthor's scheme), and so he chooses to embark on his own scheme scheme to take out the alien invader. He is (allegedly) thinking of the future: if he wipes out the all-powerful alien, then it can't turn on humankind in the future. At least, he convinces himself of that.A philosophical question is raised in the film: should Clark Kent have remained a simple man from Kansas and never have become the Superman? Should he just let people die and let calamities happen? The question is answered for us in the character of Diana Prince/Wonder Woman. She withdrew from mankind (her exact words) and just sat around watching. Watching while people died horrible deaths all around her. So, should Superman have done the same? Do these special beings, these 'metahumans', have some kind of moral imperative to intervene, or should they be allowed to be regular people, too? It seems that humans want it both ways.It seems that humans are saying: \"Don't be a superalien ... except when I and my friends and family are in trouble. Then come save us.\""

"Batman v Superman: Ultimate Edition: If your looking for a quick, cheap thrill then you might not enjoy this film at the time. This movies theatrical version was butchered by WB and in doing so reshaped the story leaving numerous plot holes. So the Ultimate Edition is the full story and the one worth seeing. Watch 'Man of Steel' before seeing this movie. There is much to claw through here, so much so that the audience might easily find themselves exhausted from the overall aggression of the film. However, a lot of the story does work. The action is good, and the emotion feels real most of the time.This film is about Superman trying to become Superman. Trying to help the world, save people, find a place in this world not as an outcast, and yet is looked at has a threat by many. Superman is not from this world, yet He is trying to be human, find a place in this world, be excepted by earths people, and come into his destiny.This film is also about Batman being Batman for 20 years and losing faith in humanity, and fearing Superman, what Superman can do with his powers. Great film, great plot, great visuals. ---Yidioo"
"I didn't see the film in the theaters and just bought the \"Extended Edition \" on Amazon. I never properly saw Man of Steel- i think I rented it and watched it when already exhausted and fell asleep. I saw the mediocre user reviews and horrible reviews from critics of this film.They really have it wrong. This is the very best either Batman or Superman. It has a different take, on things. Much darker then earlier films even darker then the Christopher Nolan Batman films.First of all Christopher Nolan is an Executive Producer. So how bad could it be? I loved Sucker Punch and Zack Snyder was involved with that. So how bad could this be? Hans Zimmer did the music, so how bad could it be?I remember watching the old Superman TV shows and reading the Superman and Batman comics as a little kid and loved them, but i wouldn't call myself a \"fan boy\" of comic universes, like so many younger people today. As an older adult I will admit my favorite TV show of all time was Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but watched it on DVD only after it had finished. I saw the second of the Dark Knight series in the theater, but the other two, I watched on DVD. They were great, but not my favorite films like so many people. i also loved the first couple Superman and Batman films in the older series. Regardless, i was not waiting with baited breath to see Man of Steel or this one.I'm more of a serious film fan, who can watch Stanley Kubrick films over and over and my favorite films in the last twenty years, are Eyes Wide Shut and Intersteller, both of which i've watched multiple times.So, with that said, take it from me, the critics have this film very wrong, just as critics hated 2001: A Space Odyssey when it first came out. This film will have lasting appreciation.Surprised how much I liked Ben Afleck's Batman. it was hard to get into Henry Cavil's scrawnier looking Superman, but it grew on me. Amy Adams was great as Lois Lane, The Gal Gadol Wonder Women was amazing. Lex Luther was terrific, like Nolan's Joker. Jeremy Irons was the best Alfred ever. Holly Hunter and Diane Lane was good too. The movie had bad reviews but made a billion dollars. Hopefully everyone buys the Ultimate Edition and it breaks sales records and the film is re-appreciated. I have no idea what scenes this Ultimate Edition added, but it is pretty perfect. Now I can't wait for Wonder Woman and the Justice League and as soon as I finish writing this am going to watch Man of Steal. I'm into it now!I can only surmise that the bad reviews stem from too much expectations of the rigid fan boy types and the radical changes in tone, we see in this film.Total masterpiece of cinema, but I have a few criticisms. There are a few hollow scenes of typical Idiot cops and authorities getting everything wrong in a cliché type way and it has a few filler scenes of that type and a few moments here and there that felt rushed and cheesy. Maybe not everything restored into the Ultimate Edition should have been. I wish there had been more Kevin Costner scenes."

"The whole entire Batman V Superman movie was great and yes even though it felt slow to the majority of the people who watched it but to me I enjoyed every part and every scene of Batman V Superman and when it got to the fight scenes both batman VS Superman and the Doomsday fight it brought so much drama, intensity, and epic performances. So with that being said I give this movie a good 10/10 because it really did go to my expectations and it brought a powerful performance and a powerful yet epic introduction to the upcoming Justice League."

"Zack Snyder not only understands the characters but he also understands how to craft a real amazing movie for fans - honestly blew me away (extended cut) Brilliant!Don't believe what the internet is telling you to think - take this from a person who has worked in the comic book industry - this is amazing!"

"When I first wrote a review for this movie a year ago exclaiming my excitement for the film, I had been high off a fresh dose of live-action DC superheroes playing out the beloved comic book stories that I had grown up on. It was all playing out before my eyes and coming to life. After a few months had passed, I began to notice things about the movie that I disliked: little gaps in the story, things that didn't add up, etc. My original rating of a 10 / 10 dropped to an 8 /10. But today it has gone back up to a 10. The extended version of the film not only rectifies the gaps but also silences critics.Many claimed that the movie was too dark or that it just didn't make sense. To those people, I say: \"Pick up a comic book!\" Many of the critics of this particular film were part of the superhero bandwagon that formed when Marvel began its spree of Avengers-related films. In fact, its estimated that over 60% of people who go to see 'superhero' genre films have never picked up a comic book in their life. I would argue that similar numbers could figure to those which view the CW televised DC Universe shows. People complain that DC comics is just too dark but the fact is that these movies are based upon actual comics which are meant to be dark (ex: The Dark Knight Returns, Injustice, etc.). Its like complaining that Game of Thrones (the TV series) sucks because they kill off too many characters. Read the books! Its frustrating to see such a beautiful work of art like Batman V Superman criticized by those ignorant to its universe and its meaning. This movie is in fact a catalyst that opens numerous doorways and leaves true fans in awe of the possibilities for future movies. But regardless of whether or not people choose to educate themselves, this film's DVD/Blu-ray extended version puts the theater release to shame. All of the plot holes and gaps are filled in 30 minutes of extended footage scattered throughout the film. The movie ultimately becomes more complete and people will wish that the movie had shown the full 3 hours of footage in its theatrical debut. As a major DC comics fan, I will of course pick up on things that a comics fan would not, but someone who does not read comics would learn to appreciate this film in its entirety with the extended version. Get your hands on a copy today or find it on Netflix or the internet somewhere!"

"I ignored the bad reviews and watched anyways. This film had a lot to live up to after Civil War was released and I went into this film expecting the worst. It ended up to be the best Superhero film of 2016 to me. One complaint was that this film was more concerned about universe building than telling a great story than Civil War but for me it was the other way around; Civil War felt like a build up to something else and to be honest, I felt that way when I saw the other MCU films. Batman vs Superman however not only had a great story, but it also felt a lot more consistent than Civil War. This film was way more diverse with the cast than the MCU but unlike the MCU, I felt like this film doesn't go overboard with the SJW stuff like the MCU films or The Star Wars Sequel films do. The Visuals were AMAZING, The Score by Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL was AMAZING as well, The Tone is just right as I actually felt for the characters emotionally, The Cinematography kept my eyes glued to the screen, and the script felt really Intelligent and Complex and despite people calling the writing confusing, I was able to piece it together with no problem whatsoever. This film is similar to Empire Strikes back in terms of popularity so over time after the other movies are released, this movie would probably be more popular.This film was way better than I Expected and deserves another chance.

"Its shame to see what critics and marvel fans did to this movie and targeted Zack Snyder for it. I have seen this movie more than 25 times till date. And i enjoy this movie as much as i enjoyed the first time. The fans who have read DC comics, wouldn't be disappointed in this movie. Its dark movie, yes it is. Because the title shows the intense situation at hand. Two superheroes about to rip each other apart for whatever reasons that brought them to this stage. Yes it had to be dark and intense.Only marvel can be stupid enough to show an alien invasion where humans are loosing the battle and the super heroes are cracking jokes while battles as if they are playing ping pong. a person playing Call of Duty game is more serious while playing than the marvel heroes fighting aliens."

"Last week some news came out from somebody online who had claimed to have seen a finished version of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. If you were like me, you've been leery of checking it out because you weren't sure how much might actually be true. Now Zack Snyder has spoken out about the spoiler-filled post, although his response doesn't really clear anything up.In a word, to MTV, he called the post \"hilarious,which might imply that he's saying that it's mostly, if not entirely, untrue. That might be the case, but then again he could have just said it was untrue and he didn't say that. What he did say, however, is that he doesn't like spoilers. While this may seem odd for the director who's most recent trailer appeared to give away the entire movie, Snyder says that's not the case. Even if you've seen the trailer, you can rest easy, as there is much more we have not seen in then finished film. Says Snyder I have the benefit of seeing the movie. It's cool that think it's too much, and I appreciate people not wanting to know, but there's plenty that they don't know. There's a lot of movie that's not in the trailer. In the process of calling the Batman v Superman Reddit review hilarious, Snyder goes on to talk about how he hates it when spoilers come out. The director would much rather that fans see the movie mostly blind. While he understands that some fans may wish to find the answers before hand, he wants his movies to be mysteries going in. If you're, as an audience member, exploring these articles, looking for answers to questions that you have, maybe you're okay with knowing before you go. It's like an individual taste. But like I said, I want people to see the movie without knowing.Spoilers are a topic that mean different things to different people. While most try to avoid them to some degree, the need to solve the mystery is a nearly universal human experience. We have an inclination to want to know the truth, even while also wanting to be surprised. For most of us getting some information is good, but getting all the information is bad, of course, only getting the details that you want can be difficult."
"The theatrical is choppy, poorly edited, hard to follow, with some really good moments mixed in their. The extended is much more fluent and is much easier to follow, it does have a long runtime, which might make it seem a bit dragging on, but if you like long films done right, like Lord of the Rings, you will like this movie as long as you get into the characters and story. Speaking of which, the story starts out perfectly showing Bruce Wayne as a character, and it is very powerful. There are several moments in this movie that are powerful, emotional, and shocking. Characters. Batman is my favorite fictional character of all time, and believe me when I say, Ben Affleck as Batman was perfect, he had the charisma, the anger, and the look of being through some bad stuff Gal Gadot also does perfect as Wonder Woman, but if you want to really see how good she does, go watch the Wonder Woman movie. Henry Call as Superman. I really don't like it when people say Christopher Reeves is better. Don't get me wrong, Reeves does great, but can you imagine him as Superman in this movie? I wouldn't like it. It would be like Adam West playing Batman in The Dark Knight. Henry Cavill does great in this role, I can say everything about him as I said with Ben Affleck. Jesse Eisenberg as Luthor. I thought it was different in a good way. I've heard a criticism for him as being too much like Joker, but is that a bad thing? Joker is my favorite villain, so to see Superman have an enemy that crazy, but still hold the values Luthor needs to be Luthor, I think it is great. The thing I thought this movie was lacking in the first and second acts was humor, at least good humor. If there was more humor, I would've given this movie a ten because it would give a more relaxing feel to the parts that needed it. All in all though, this movie was awesome, it had powerful moments, it was badass, and just plain fun. It had a great story arc and does its job very well."

"*I will be talking about the Ultimate Edition of the film* This was one of the most anticipated CBM of all time. Ever since the arrival and subsequent success of Marvel's The Avengers people have wondered when will DC launch its own cinematic universe, one of the main reasons being the opportunity to finally see titans such as Batman and Superman share the screen together: the ultimate nerd dream. On 2016, the moment finally came for BvS to be released AND.. it performed poorly. Not only did critical reception left a lot to be desired, but fan reactions where surprisingly split after its cinematic debut. People either loved it and called Zack a genius, or hated it and called him a hack. Me, personally, I found myself with middle of the road feelings, for sure, but more leaning towards the negative side with subsequent viewings. The theatrical cut of the film showcased amazing performances, incredible visuals, and action set pieces that seemed like comic book panels come to life, in a good way. However, when it comes to its narrative structure and more technical aspects like editing, the film was seriously flawed. More plot holes than Age of Ultron, questionable character decisions, random editing that lacked cohesion and focus, and forced dramatic moments that lacked any impact because the attempts at character development ranged from limited to nonexistent, especially when it comes to Superman's character. I thought it was a 5/10 movie at best. As such, I was kind of skeptical about the idea of a 30 minute longer version. I say kind of because I know how Zack works. I remember Watchmen being vastly improved with its director's cut, so in a way I was expecting BvS to perform in a similar manner, but I also feared those 30 minutes wold be just there to amplify action and discredit storytelling issues. Oh boy, I'm so glad I was proved wrong. The ultimate cut of the film was infuriating, but not because it was awful, but because it questions the sanity of WB executives and editors and makes you wonder what were they thinking during the editing process. What I got out of the Ultimate Edition was a thought-provoking deconstruction of two very iconic superheroes that gave spotlight to the struggles both of them face when they aren't fighting crime. What I got was an extremely well produced character study on both Batman and Superman in a cynical world, a world dangerously close to our own. We meet Batman as a ruthless, worn out hero that has seen the failure behind his ideals and witnessed some truly horrifying things in his life. Superman, on the other hand, is portrayed as a godlike figure that seeks to do good in the world, but finds himself emotionally conflicted once he realized that every good deed he does leaves behind a trail of destruction (most of it due to Luthor's antics). In my opinion, this is a hugely original approach, one that distances itself from the rest of the competition and delivers a dark, somber, yet relevant superhero movie that understands both characters and gives them real human struggles to deal with. I felt invested in both of them, and hoped that by the end of the film both could find a way to redeem themselves. Their character arcs were very well established during the first two acts of the movie, and by the time we get to the titular climactic battle the emotion behind the jaw-dropping action is intensified. Lex Luthor as a villain was also given more time to develop with this new edition. One of the main criticisms with the original version was the fact that his plan relied too much on conveniences, and the character's mannerisms and mad-scientist attitude was annoying, and that goes without saying his motivations were unclear. Not only do we spend more time understanding his hate for any godlike figure and thus his hatred for Superman, but the added scenes allowed us to witness his entire plan come to fruition. It sells the cold, manipulative, calculating attributes of his comic counterpart. The acting is spot on. Every actor owns his/her role, from Cavill's Superman, to Ben Affleck as Batman, Eisenberg as Luthor, and Gadot as Wonder Woman, whose scenes are brief, but are more than enough to sell the strong and ferocious warrior that she is. Cinematography is stunning, and miles above that of Man of Steel's. And the soundtrack by Zimmer and Junkie XL? Perfect, just perfect. When it comes to flaws, the film still has some of those. The Martha moment, while serving as a pivotal character moment for Batman, felt off in execution, and its understandable that many people got mad at it. If your main complaint about BvS the first time around was its bleak tone and subject matter, this film is still not for you. I understand most were expecting to see the heroes being the most iconic versions of themselves, clashing in an elongated battle and evoking the same feelings The Avengers gave audiences back in 2012. In that sense, the film will remain divisive, but at least I have the comfort of saying that, at the very least, the film is competently made."

"This film was amazing. Ben Affleck was easily the best part of this movie, he brought his a-game as Batman. The chemistry between Affleck & Irons was outstanding. Gal Gadot did a great job as Wonder Woman. The fight between Batman & Superman was awesome. The final fight with Doomsday was outstanding in every way possible. However, there is only one problem with this film and that's Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor. He was sadly missed cast in this role, but then again it's really the fault of Warner Bros. Studios. Overall, this film deliver on almost every level. I highly recommend that you watch the extended version of this film."

"I know I know. I saw it in theaters too, and felt like it could've been so much better. While the Batman element was good, the narrative felt fractured, and the third act was just one long stunt scene. Superman was relegated to a supporting character, and other characters didn't get a chance to shine. And then I chanced on the ultimate cut. Calling it 30 mins of \"extra\" footage is unfair to Zack Snyder because it's exactly these 30 mins that makes the movie a worthy one. What I can say about the theatrical cut is this - It had the blockbuster elements - music, visuals, stunts, CGI. But, it lacked the human elements. The first 20 mins of the movie had it, but not after that. The extended cut in comparison has a flow to the narrative. There are no disjointed scenes, everything flows smoothly, and there's connective tissue. Superman gets to spend some time with his father, and mother. Clark Kent does some investigative journalism. Superman helps the people after the blast. Lois Lane doesn't jump to conclusions, she gets to the bottom of the crime. Lex Luthor apparently had a coherent plan - everything is explained pretty well. Wonder Woman was already good, so there's no change there :) Also, the \"Martha\" scene seems better executed, because it is a few seconds longer, and there's time to breathe it in. So, here's my take on this movie - The theatrical cut was junk. Get the Bluray for ultimate edition, and you shall not be disappointed. I've seen it so many more times now, and it's the definitive cut. It is the movie we deserve. It's a unique take on Batman, and Superman. It's a gritty take on the superhero movie genre, and definitely the best DCEU movie, and the best DC movie since The Dark Knight.P.S. Yes it's dark. We're adults, and we should appreciate mature film making without intentionally silly moments. It attempts to be philosophical, and something deep instead of just trying to make you chuckle."

"This is one of the best superhero movies ever made. Zack Snyder is a magician behind the camera.The reason behind so many complaints is the fact that Warner Bros. marketed this movie as a fight between Batman and Superman. That's not what it is. It's a movie about the origins of the Justice League.The cinematography, the acting and the score are all second to none. This film is phenomenal.P.S: watch the 3 hour extended cut that Snyder intended you to see, not the 2 and a half hour movie that Warner Bros. decided would be better for theaters."

"I don't care what the critics say, this is a very well-done movie. I'll start my review by listing what I like about the movie.1.) Ben Affleck is the best batman to me and it is not close. He pulls off the role of an aging batman extremely well. Also, Zack Snyder's vision of batman is legit. I have always hated batman up until this adaptation of him. Instead of being a conflicted and idealistic batman, this batman is dark, gritty, and 100% a badass. His equipment is decked out with machine guns and he has no aversion to killing people. In fact, he probably kills about 50 criminal by the time this movie is over. The warehouse scene is the coolest batman scene in any movie.2.) The development of a grudge between batman and superman is pulled off flawlessly. It actually makes sense why batman dislikes superman. Then, when they do fight it is about the coolest thing you can expect to see from a superhero film. 3.) I disagree with a lot of people about Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor. In my opinion, he played his role to perfection. 4.) B v S sets up Wonder Woman and Justice League with Gal Gadot's cameo as Wonder Woman and short clips of Aquaman, the Flash, and Cyborg. B v S is one of my favorite superhero films and rewatching it never gets old."

"The theatrical cut of this film is garbage which is why I rated it eight stars instead of nine. The first time I watched this film I didn't like it (not straight out hate but didn't like). Character motivations didn't make any sense, Lex was annoying as s***, editing was sloppy, and it was overly dark and broody for an action superhero movie. A year + a half, five Marvel films, a ton of bad reviews and a Justice League later a thought popped into my head: \"what if I watched BVS again\". This time I didn't have trailers ruining the best moments, I only vaguely remembered the film, and I was conditioned to look at it negatively but something unexpected happened: I actually loved it. Superman was just a normal person that tried to make a difference cause he could that others imposed their own beliefs on. Lex Luthor was a genius that couldn't stand his powerlessness compared to Superman or more accurately a super being. As Alfred said \"The fever, the rage, the feeling of powerlessness that turns good men... cruel\" and you see the same thought process in Batman. Batman, just like Lex Luthor feels powerless in the midst of a god-being and just like Lex he attempts to destroy him so he can get his sense of power back but unlike Lex, Batman learns something. I what is one of the corniest lines of the movie Superman says, \"Martha\" when he knows he can't win against Batman in a late desperate attempt to save his mother. Not only does this name connect with Bruce Wayne but it also shows what really matters to a man of steel: it isn't power, it isn't fame or anything else, it is his Mother and on a broader scale it is people. Lex (who doesn't care about people at all) knows he doesn't have the power so he creates something from his blood and the remains of Zod: A Doomsday for Superman. Not only does this film have depth but it also doesn't always explain it to you which is rare in a blockbuster action superhero flick normally cater to semi-comic book fans and people that want to shove popcorn in their mouths. This film rewards you for really noticing the details while still having massive explosions. One of my favorites is how Lex has all of Batman's branded killed which is why he isn't afraid of the branding at the end or Grandma's Peach Tea as a way of scaring the s*** out of someone. Of course, this film isn't perfect and I do have personal dislikes. The Batman V Superman fight was slow and pretty boring especially after watching such an amazing fight in Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 2 (If you haven't watched the animated Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 1 and 2 you are sorely missing out on something fantastic). Also, the addition of Wonder Woman who pretty much steals a hacker thing, gives it back and then suits up and fights against a giant monster thing. Not to say I don't like Wonder Woman (She is one of my favorite Superheroes of all time who showed not only can woman kick a** but they also don't need to be ashamed of their sexuality or gender) but she wasn't really that helpful to the plot and just brought in to expand the universe which was well done through Lex's superhuman hunting files. Also, the post-apocalyptic scene that was just a dream could have been cut but nothing is perfect except movies like Citizen Kane which isn't a lot of fun to watch cause it is too perfect. So to summarize, the theatrical cut is bad, the ultimate cut is Amazing and the other cut is meh. Please give it a second chance because it deserves it and save a good director from losing grace because of something he didn't do."
"I really liked it, don't know what all the hate is about. I'm actually a Marvel fan from when I was 7 or so, but Superman and Batman together in 1 movie? Just great. And personally I like Ben Affleck even better than Christian Bale as Batman. So just watch and enjoy, I know I did!"

"That's right. We have been waiting for these two heroes to finally meet and fight against each other. This movie is so good in both plot and special effects.Henry Cavill and Ben Affleck have performed well in their acting stages. They are the best superhero actors and they have filmed their fighting scenes very well. The movie starts to show the conflict between the lives of the heroes and now they have blamed each other for it. This movie is amazing and sets up a good plot for Dawn Justice."

"Actually...I didn't know what to expect. When you see Wonder Woman, you know it will be off of Wonder Woman and off of a Wonder Woman story, but with Batman V Superman, I was like, \"hmmmm, so who is this about?\" It was pretty obvious that it would feature many characters, but I thought the introduction to Batman was amazing. Ben Affleck nailed the part, not only as Batman but also as Bruce Wayne. He is my Batman. Henry Cavill continued to be super as the Man of Steel. And he is my Super - Man. A dark story? Yes, without a doubt. Could it have had a few more jokes? Sure. But not all movies or stories need to have jokes when certain events are serious. I really hope people can see this review and take another look at the movie, because, I loved it. I really hope the ratings can go up, eventually. And P.S, this movie is the perfect set up to Justice League."

"This film is crucial to the extended universe that DC is trying to build, but it feels highly derivative of better stories and continues to demonstrate the misuse of the iconic characters mentioned in the title. Plus Jesse Eisenberg feels wildly mis-casted."

"I'll start by making it clear I have only ever seen the Ultimate Edition. I'm aware of what was cut out for the theatrical release, so I will concede up front that most of the criticisms about pacing, editing, and missing bits of plot at release were merited.With that caveat out of the way, I must reiterate that this was bar-none the boldest superhero movie I have ever seen. To me, it was arguably the best as well, though \"best\" shouldn't be taken to mean \"most enjoyable.\" That honor easily goes to \"Thor: Ragnarok.\" What makes BvS stand out among other films in the genre is that it takes two characters who have been done to death since the 1970s and brings them up to date. I recently tried to watch \"Superman: The Movie\" for the first time in a number of years, and while it was still good and Reeves will always be iconic, I just couldn't take it seriously. I'll put it this way: If the story in BvS was \"stupid\" in your view but Superman turning back time by spinning the earth backward on its axis didn't seem like one of the dumbest things you have ever seen -in any movie from any genre- to the extent that it outright ruins the movie for you, then your opinion about BvS isn't worth much. Nostalgic bias was always going to be a problem for this movie, and the way people reacted to and reviewed \"Man of Steel\" was telling in this regard.That brings me to Zack Snyder's take on Superman. You know, that guy whose status as the first extraterrestrial ever encountered by humanity was a total non-issue in the old movies. Apparently, Snyder has a similar view to my own in that his take on the Man of Steel makes his being an alien a core piece of his identity. He may look like any other (absurdly attractive) person, but he knows what he is, and that makes him perpetually uncertain of where he fits in this world. He is essentially good and really does care about people, but he struggles to truly empathize with the likes of us. To be human is to be frail, and that is not something he can easily relate to. This is the root of his conflict with Batman.Just as Clark struggles to genuinely relate to most people, Snyder's Batman either refuses to or otherwise just can't relate to Superman. He doesn't see him as anything but a threat regardless of Superman's clear good intentions. Remember, a small group of Kryptonians were able to bring humanity to the brink of extinction in less than a day, and Bruce Wayne is nothing if not a realist. He didn't know the guy from Kansas. He only knew the god from another world.While Batman's anger toward and fear of Superman are readily apparent from the start, Superman's inability to imagine things from Bruce Wayne's perspective only becomes truly apparent during their first real interaction. This reminded me of the animated version of the \"world's finest\" storyline, where Superman judges Batman harshly for using fear tactics and threats of violence (also, actual violence) to get the job done. Superman wasn't willing to consider what it would take for a human man to fight criminals and save innocents, or what that life would do to him over time. Just as Batman didn't see the guy from Kansas, Superman didn't see the man who lives his life trapped in one brutal, unthinkably traumatic moment (this was beautifully conveyed during the film's opening moments), and had spent his whole adult life bearing witness to humanity at its absolute worst.The conflict between these two characters is as old as human history. They want the same things, but they can't understand one another. So they fight. And what a fight it was.Watching a fight between, say, Captain America and Iron Man was, to me, more frustrating than anything because each understood the other's perspective perfectly. The fight between Batman and Superman in BvS was genuinely gut-wrenching, as intended, because they would have understood one another if either had tried. The whole sequence hilighted Batman's tactical prowess and ability to control a situation. Maybe the most badass thing about the fight was that it ended exactly where Batman planned. That brings me to the big elephant in the room named \"Martha.\"I can't recall exactly which YouTuber put it this way, but if you thought the \"save Martha\" exchange was about their mothers having the same name, you had your brain turned off. The brain-on people have explained this to death, but it bears repeating. This was the moment when Superman became humanized to Batman. He was about to die, and his only concern was for his adoptive human mother. He still believed that the man about to take his life would do the right thing. Even with the cowl on, there was no mistaking the look on Batman's face. It was the look of shame, guilt, and sudden uncertainty that says \"What am I doing?\" Turns out even the most brutal, angry version of Bruce Wayne is better than Tony Stark at knowing right from wrong. At knowing that he had gone too far.From there, the third act was a series of truly impressive (albeit mostly CGI) fight sequences, beginning with what I regard as the undisputed champion of Batman fights. Nothing in the Nolan movies (and especially nothing in the Burton movies) even came close. Go ahead, try to convince yourself that Batman and Bane taking turns punching one another in the face until Bane's mask broke was a good fight sequence. No, this was a fight straight out of \"Arkham Knight,\" and it was glorious. The battle against Doomsday really was one for the books. From the moment Wonder Woman arrived accompanied by the intense sounds of Tina Guo's electric cello to Superman's tragic, heroic death at the hands of Doomsday, I was glued to the screen. Sure, the mere presence of Doomsday spoiled the end to a degree, but watching the Man of Steel laboring to carry that kryptonite spear towards certain death was no less impactful. A brief word on Jesse Eisenberg's take on Lex Luthor. At least one other reviewer on this site already said it best when they pointed out that this was his origin story. If you consider his scheme objectively, he is actually one of the more formidable incarnations of the character. If we're lucky, we'll eventually get to see a Snyder Cut of \"Justice League\" and find out where this story was actually meant to go. For the record, Joss Whedon and Danny Elfman both should have said \"no\" to taking a dump on someone else's art."
"BATMAN V SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE brings a fantastic surprise to a smash-hit team-up with one of the worlds most beloved DC Comics' icons of all time. The movie delivers spectacular casting, and fantastic acting with different characters having their shine in each scenes.The story follows Clark Kent/Superman who becomes a threat, after the destruction in Metropolis in Man Of Steel.(2013). Batman/Bruce Wayne sees him as a threat and begins his war on Superman.The movie brings spectacular storytelling, it tells the complications of human against alien who are on the same side, and the first meeting of Batman and Superman. The story of Bruce Wayne, with his many years of The Caped Crusader, sends him on a spiral of \"out of control\", sheer anger, and builds tension to wanting to defeat the Man of Steel. Snyder has fantastically gave this storytelling an exciting nod to the comics.Lex Luthor, played by Jesse Einsberg, delivers a very interesting performance, but very differently by him showing is his \"origin\" before he becomes a bald foe to the Man of Steel. He shows that his love of \"god vs man\" terrorises mankind when he ultimately creates Doomsday, and Batman realises Superman's inner heroism.It packs so many great \"out of nowhere\" excitement, including a first-look of the fearful Wonder Woman a.k.a. Diana Prince, played by Gal Gadot, and a fresh-new glimpse of the superhero DC canon: The Justice League.WATCH THIS MOVIE! The critics are out of their mind. It's a fun-packed action adventure which still keeps the movie enjoyable until it's final minutes of the movie. It's a FANTASTIC MOVIE! BEN AFFLECK AS BATMAN... is Incredible!A 10/10 overall!"
"I want to go on record as saying that this is a truly thrilling cinematic experience in so many ways. If pressed, I guess I could acknowledge that there were a couple ... let's say \"clumsy\" moments. And in a film that runs to three hours, that hardly seems like a significant issue, certainly not enough to rate it with fewer than 9 stars.This film has everything. There is dramatic tension right from the start. There is a magnificent story arc that picks up quite seamlessly from 'Man of Steel' and propels the viewer not only into the life of Clark Kent/Superman but also of Bruce Wayne/Batman.The villain is no mere cartoon of a villain; he is truly thoroughly (and apparently irrevocably) diabolical. He is a psychopath, and you wish for his death over and over and over. You want Superman to reduce him to ash with the power of his eyes.I have read a number of viewers' reviews, and it seems that the people who disliked the film / gave it a low rating had rather unfair and unrealistic expectations of it. That is, their own prejudices about how the plot could/should unfold or what the character development could/should be, etc. ruined the film for them. And that is a shame.My thought is: I settle into my seat, wait for the lights to dim, and then I wait to be transported by the film. I accept it, lock, stock, and barrel.As another reviewer remarked, I love how the film begins from the point of view of Bruce Wayne as he is among people on the ground who have fallen victim to the attack of Zod and the other Kryptonians.Why would Bruce Wayne not like Superman? Why would the good people of Earth hurl insults at Superman and burn him in effigy (on the news)? Because the good people of Earth just got catapulted into a new reality in which there are not only extraterrestrial beings (surprise!) but they are also superman! And a group of them are hell-bent on destroying humankind and taking the planet for themselves.It is difficult to see Superman as separate from the whole Kryptonian Krew.It seems that many moviegoers forgot that Bruce Wayne is also human. Sure, he's a hero, but he is flawed.. Just like the rest of us. He is a vigilante, after all.He has let his vigilantism get the better of him. HE is actually the one working outside the boundaries of the law, not Superman. It is the clear head of Alfred that shows us that he has gone into a rather dark place, that he has not seen what is really going on (in Luthor's scheme), and so he chooses to embark on his own scheme scheme to take out the alien invader. He is (allegedly) thinking of the future: if he wipes out the all-powerful alien, then it can't turn on humankind in the future. At least, he convinces himself of that.A philosophical question is raised in the film: should Clark Kent have remained a simple man from Kansas and never have become the Superman? Should he just let people die and let calamities happen? The question is answered for us in the character of Diana Prince/Wonder Woman. She withdrew from mankind (her exact words) and just sat around watching. Watching while people died horrible deaths all around her. So, should Superman have done the same? Do these special beings, these 'metahumans', have some kind of moral imperative to intervene, or should they be allowed to be regular people, too? It seems that humans want it both ways.It seems that humans are saying: \"Don't be a superalien ... except when I and my friends and family are in trouble. Then come save us.\""

"Batman v Superman: Ultimate Edition: If your looking for a quick, cheap thrill then you might not enjoy this film at the time. This movies theatrical version was butchered by WB and in doing so reshaped the story leaving numerous plot holes. So the Ultimate Edition is the full story and the one worth seeing. Watch 'Man of Steel' before seeing this movie. There is much to claw through here, so much so that the audience might easily find themselves exhausted from the overall aggression of the film. However, a lot of the story does work. The action is good, and the emotion feels real most of the time.This film is about Superman trying to become Superman. Trying to help the world, save people, find a place in this world not as an outcast, and yet is looked at has a threat by many. Superman is not from this world, yet He is trying to be human, find a place in this world, be excepted by earths people, and come into his destiny.This film is also about Batman being Batman for 20 years and losing faith in humanity, and fearing Superman, what Superman can do with his powers. Great film, great plot, great visuals. ---Yidioo"
"I didn't see the film in the theaters and just bought the \"Extended Edition \" on Amazon. I never properly saw Man of Steel- i think I rented it and watched it when already exhausted and fell asleep. I saw the mediocre user reviews and horrible reviews from critics of this film.They really have it wrong. This is the very best either Batman or Superman. It has a different take, on things. Much darker then earlier films even darker then the Christopher Nolan Batman films.First of all Christopher Nolan is an Executive Producer. So how bad could it be? I loved Sucker Punch and Zack Snyder was involved with that. So how bad could this be? Hans Zimmer did the music, so how bad could it be?I remember watching the old Superman TV shows and reading the Superman and Batman comics as a little kid and loved them, but i wouldn't call myself a \"fan boy\" of comic universes, like so many younger people today. As an older adult I will admit my favorite TV show of all time was Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but watched it on DVD only after it had finished. I saw the second of the Dark Knight series in the theater, but the other two, I watched on DVD. They were great, but not my favorite films like so many people. i also loved the first couple Superman and Batman films in the older series. Regardless, i was not waiting with baited breath to see Man of Steel or this one.I'm more of a serious film fan, who can watch Stanley Kubrick films over and over and my favorite films in the last twenty years, are Eyes Wide Shut and Intersteller, both of which i've watched multiple times.So, with that said, take it from me, the critics have this film very wrong, just as critics hated 2001: A Space Odyssey when it first came out. This film will have lasting appreciation.Surprised how much I liked Ben Afleck's Batman. it was hard to get into Henry Cavil's scrawnier looking Superman, but it grew on me. Amy Adams was great as Lois Lane, The Gal Gadol Wonder Women was amazing. Lex Luther was terrific, like Nolan's Joker. Jeremy Irons was the best Alfred ever. Holly Hunter and Diane Lane was good too. The movie had bad reviews but made a billion dollars. Hopefully everyone buys the Ultimate Edition and it breaks sales records and the film is re-appreciated. I have no idea what scenes this Ultimate Edition added, but it is pretty perfect. Now I can't wait for Wonder Woman and the Justice League and as soon as I finish writing this am going to watch Man of Steal. I'm into it now!I can only surmise that the bad reviews stem from too much expectations of the rigid fan boy types and the radical changes in tone, we see in this film.Total masterpiece of cinema, but I have a few criticisms. There are a few hollow scenes of typical Idiot cops and authorities getting everything wrong in a cliché type way and it has a few filler scenes of that type and a few moments here and there that felt rushed and cheesy. Maybe not everything restored into the Ultimate Edition should have been. I wish there had been more Kevin Costner scenes."

"The whole entire Batman V Superman movie was great and yes even though it felt slow to the majority of the people who watched it but to me I enjoyed every part and every scene of Batman V Superman and when it got to the fight scenes both batman VS Superman and the Doomsday fight it brought so much drama, intensity, and epic performances. So with that being said I give this movie a good 10/10 because it really did go to my expectations and it brought a powerful performance and a powerful yet epic introduction to the upcoming Justice League."

"When I first wrote a review for this movie a year ago exclaiming my excitement for the film, I had been high off a fresh dose of live-action DC superheroes playing out the beloved comic book stories that I had grown up on. It was all playing out before my eyes and coming to life. After a few months had passed, I began to notice things about the movie that I disliked: little gaps in the story, things that didn't add up, etc. My original rating of a 10 / 10 dropped to an 8 /10. But today it has gone back up to a 10. The extended version of the film not only rectifies the gaps but also silences critics.Many claimed that the movie was too dark or that it just didn't make sense. To those people, I say: \"Pick up a comic book!\" Many of the critics of this particular film were part of the superhero bandwagon that formed when Marvel began its spree of Avengers-related films. In fact, its estimated that over 60% of people who go to see 'superhero' genre films have never picked up a comic book in their life. I would argue that similar numbers could figure to those which view the CW televised DC Universe shows. People complain that DC comics is just too dark but the fact is that these movies are based upon actual comics which are meant to be dark (ex: The Dark Knight Returns, Injustice, etc.). Its like complaining that Game of Thrones (the TV series) sucks because they kill off too many characters. Read the books! Its frustrating to see such a beautiful work of art like Batman V Superman criticized by those ignorant to its universe and its meaning. This movie is in fact a catalyst that opens numerous doorways and leaves true fans in awe of the possibilities for future movies. But regardless of whether or not people choose to educate themselves, this film's DVD/Blu-ray extended version puts the theater release to shame. All of the plot holes and gaps are filled in 30 minutes of extended footage scattered throughout the film. The movie ultimately becomes more complete and people will wish that the movie had shown the full 3 hours of footage in its theatrical debut. As a major DC comics fan, I will of course pick up on things that a comics fan would not, but someone who does not read comics would learn to appreciate this film in its entirety with the extended version. Get your hands on a copy today or find it on Netflix or the internet somewhere!"

"I ignored the bad reviews and watched anyways. This film had a lot to live up to after Civil War was released and I went into this film expecting the worst. It ended up to be the best Superhero film of 2016 to me. One complaint was that this film was more concerned about universe building than telling a great story than Civil War but for me it was the other way around; Civil War felt like a build up to something else and to be honest, I felt that way when I saw the other MCU films. Batman vs Superman however not only had a great story, but it also felt a lot more consistent than Civil War. This film was way more diverse with the cast than the MCU but unlike the MCU, I felt like this film doesn't go overboard with the SJW stuff like the MCU films or The Star Wars Sequel films do. The Visuals were AMAZING, The Score by Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL was AMAZING as well, The Tone is just right as I actually felt for the characters emotionally, The Cinematography kept my eyes glued to the screen, and the script felt really Intelligent and Complex and despite people calling the writing confusing, I was able to piece it together with no problem whatsoever. This film is similar to Empire Strikes back in terms of popularity so over time after the other movies are released, this movie would probably be more popular.This film was way better than I Expected and deserves another chance.

"Its shame to see what critics and marvel fans did to this movie and targeted Zack Snyder for it. I have seen this movie more than 25 times till date. And i enjoy this movie as much as i enjoyed the first time. The fans who have read DC comics, wouldn't be disappointed in this movie. Its dark movie, yes it is. Because the title shows the intense situation at hand. Two superheroes about to rip each other apart for whatever reasons that brought them to this stage. Yes it had to be dark and intense.Only marvel can be stupid enough to show an alien invasion where humans are loosing the battle and the super heroes are cracking jokes while battles as if they are playing ping pong. a person playing Call of Duty game is more serious while playing than the marvel heroes fighting aliens."

"Last week some news came out from somebody online who had claimed to have seen a finished version of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. If you were like me, you've been leery of checking it out because you weren't sure how much might actually be true. Now Zack Snyder has spoken out about the spoiler-filled post, although his response doesn't really clear anything up.In a word, to MTV, he called the post \"hilarious,which might imply that he's saying that it's mostly, if not entirely, untrue. That might be the case, but then again he could have just said it was untrue and he didn't say that. What he did say, however, is that he doesn't like spoilers. While this may seem odd for the director who's most recent trailer appeared to give away the entire movie, Snyder says that's not the case. Even if you've seen the trailer, you can rest easy, as there is much more we have not seen in then finished film. Says Snyder I have the benefit of seeing the movie. It's cool that think it's too much, and I appreciate people not wanting to know, but there's plenty that they don't know. There's a lot of movie that's not in the trailer. In the process of calling the Batman v Superman Reddit review hilarious, Snyder goes on to talk about how he hates it when spoilers come out. The director would much rather that fans see the movie mostly blind. While he understands that some fans may wish to find the answers before hand, he wants his movies to be mysteries going in. If you're, as an audience member, exploring these articles, looking for answers to questions that you have, maybe you're okay with knowing before you go. It's like an individual taste. But like I said, I want people to see the movie without knowing.Spoilers are a topic that mean different things to different people. While most try to avoid them to some degree, the need to solve the mystery is a nearly universal human experience. We have an inclination to want to know the truth, even while also wanting to be surprised. For most of us getting some information is good, but getting all the information is bad, of course, only getting the details that you want can be difficult."
"The theatrical is choppy, poorly edited, hard to follow, with some really good moments mixed in their. The extended is much more fluent and is much easier to follow, it does have a long runtime, which might make it seem a bit dragging on, but if you like long films done right, like Lord of the Rings, you will like this movie as long as you get into the characters and story. Speaking of which, the story starts out perfectly showing Bruce Wayne as a character, and it is very powerful. There are several moments in this movie that are powerful, emotional, and shocking. Characters. Batman is my favorite fictional character of all time, and believe me when I say, Ben Affleck as Batman was perfect, he had the charisma, the anger, and the look of being through some bad stuff Gal Gadot also does perfect as Wonder Woman, but if you want to really see how good she does, go watch the Wonder Woman movie. Henry Call as Superman. I really don't like it when people say Christopher Reeves is better. Don't get me wrong, Reeves does great, but can you imagine him as Superman in this movie? I wouldn't like it. It would be like Adam West playing Batman in The Dark Knight. Henry Cavill does great in this role, I can say everything about him as I said with Ben Affleck. Jesse Eisenberg as Luthor. I thought it was different in a good way. I've heard a criticism for him as being too much like Joker, but is that a bad thing? Joker is my favorite villain, so to see Superman have an enemy that crazy, but still hold the values Luthor needs to be Luthor, I think it is great. The thing I thought this movie was lacking in the first and second acts was humor, at least good humor. If there was more humor, I would've given this movie a ten because it would give a more relaxing feel to the parts that needed it. All in all though, this movie was awesome, it had powerful moments, it was badass, and just plain fun. It had a great story arc and does its job very well."

"*I will be talking about the Ultimate Edition of the film* This was one of the most anticipated CBM of all time. Ever since the arrival and subsequent success of Marvel's The Avengers people have wondered when will DC launch its own cinematic universe, one of the main reasons being the opportunity to finally see titans such as Batman and Superman share the screen together: the ultimate nerd dream. On 2016, the moment finally came for BvS to be released AND.. it performed poorly. Not only did critical reception left a lot to be desired, but fan reactions where surprisingly split after its cinematic debut. People either loved it and called Zack a genius, or hated it and called him a hack. Me, personally, I found myself with middle of the road feelings, for sure, but more leaning towards the negative side with subsequent viewings. The theatrical cut of the film showcased amazing performances, incredible visuals, and action set pieces that seemed like comic book panels come to life, in a good way. However, when it comes to its narrative structure and more technical aspects like editing, the film was seriously flawed. More plot holes than Age of Ultron, questionable character decisions, random editing that lacked cohesion and focus, and forced dramatic moments that lacked any impact because the attempts at character development ranged from limited to nonexistent, especially when it comes to Superman's character. I thought it was a 5/10 movie at best. As such, I was kind of skeptical about the idea of a 30 minute longer version. I say kind of because I know how Zack works. I remember Watchmen being vastly improved with its director's cut, so in a way I was expecting BvS to perform in a similar manner, but I also feared those 30 minutes wold be just there to amplify action and discredit storytelling issues. Oh boy, I'm so glad I was proved wrong. The ultimate cut of the film was infuriating, but not because it was awful, but because it questions the sanity of WB executives and editors and makes you wonder what were they thinking during the editing process. What I got out of the Ultimate Edition was a thought-provoking deconstruction of two very iconic superheroes that gave spotlight to the struggles both of them face when they aren't fighting crime. What I got was an extremely well produced character study on both Batman and Superman in a cynical world, a world dangerously close to our own. We meet Batman as a ruthless, worn out hero that has seen the failure behind his ideals and witnessed some truly horrifying things in his life. Superman, on the other hand, is portrayed as a godlike figure that seeks to do good in the world, but finds himself emotionally conflicted once he realized that every good deed he does leaves behind a trail of destruction (most of it due to Luthor's antics). In my opinion, this is a hugely original approach, one that distances itself from the rest of the competition and delivers a dark, somber, yet relevant superhero movie that understands both characters and gives them real human struggles to deal with. I felt invested in both of them, and hoped that by the end of the film both could find a way to redeem themselves. Their character arcs were very well established during the first two acts of the movie, and by the time we get to the titular climactic battle the emotion behind the jaw-dropping action is intensified. Lex Luthor as a villain was also given more time to develop with this new edition. One of the main criticisms with the original version was the fact that his plan relied too much on conveniences, and the character's mannerisms and mad-scientist attitude was annoying, and that goes without saying his motivations were unclear. Not only do we spend more time understanding his hate for any godlike figure and thus his hatred for Superman, but the added scenes allowed us to witness his entire plan come to fruition. It sells the cold, manipulative, calculating attributes of his comic counterpart. The acting is spot on. Every actor owns his/her role, from Cavill's Superman, to Ben Affleck as Batman, Eisenberg as Luthor, and Gadot as Wonder Woman, whose scenes are brief, but are more than enough to sell the strong and ferocious warrior that she is. Cinematography is stunning, and miles above that of Man of Steel's. And the soundtrack by Zimmer and Junkie XL? Perfect, just perfect. When it comes to flaws, the film still has some of those. The Martha moment, while serving as a pivotal character moment for Batman, felt off in execution, and its understandable that many people got mad at it. If your main complaint about BvS the first time around was its bleak tone and subject matter, this film is still not for you. I understand most were expecting to see the heroes being the most iconic versions of themselves, clashing in an elongated battle and evoking the same feelings The Avengers gave audiences back in 2012. In that sense, the film will remain divisive, but at least I have the comfort of saying that, at the very least, the film is competently made."

"This film was amazing. Ben Affleck was easily the best part of this movie, he brought his a-game as Batman. The chemistry between Affleck & Irons was outstanding. Gal Gadot did a great job as Wonder Woman. The fight between Batman & Superman was awesome. The final fight with Doomsday was outstanding in every way possible. However, there is only one problem with this film and that's Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor. He was sadly missed cast in this role, but then again it's really the fault of Warner Bros. Studios. Overall, this film deliver on almost every level. I highly recommend that you watch the extended version of this film."

"I know I know. I saw it in theaters too, and felt like it could've been so much better. While the Batman element was good, the narrative felt fractured, and the third act was just one long stunt scene. Superman was relegated to a supporting character, and other characters didn't get a chance to shine. And then I chanced on the ultimate cut. Calling it 30 mins of \"extra\" footage is unfair to Zack Snyder because it's exactly these 30 mins that makes the movie a worthy one. What I can say about the theatrical cut is this - It had the blockbuster elements - music, visuals, stunts, CGI. But, it lacked the human elements. The first 20 mins of the movie had it, but not after that. The extended cut in comparison has a flow to the narrative. There are no disjointed scenes, everything flows smoothly, and there's connective tissue. Superman gets to spend some time with his father, and mother. Clark Kent does some investigative journalism. Superman helps the people after the blast. Lois Lane doesn't jump to conclusions, she gets to the bottom of the crime. Lex Luthor apparently had a coherent plan - everything is explained pretty well. Wonder Woman was already good, so there's no change there :) Also, the \"Martha\" scene seems better executed, because it is a few seconds longer, and there's time to breathe it in. So, here's my take on this movie - The theatrical cut was junk. Get the Bluray for ultimate edition, and you shall not be disappointed. I've seen it so many more times now, and it's the definitive cut. It is the movie we deserve. It's a unique take on Batman, and Superman. It's a gritty take on the superhero movie genre, and definitely the best DCEU movie, and the best DC movie since The Dark Knight.P.S. Yes it's dark. We're adults, and we should appreciate mature film making without intentionally silly moments. It attempts to be philosophical, and something deep instead of just trying to make you chuckle."

"This is one of the best superhero movies ever made. Zack Snyder is a magician behind the camera.The reason behind so many complaints is the fact that Warner Bros. marketed this movie as a fight between Batman and Superman. That's not what it is. It's a movie about the origins of the Justice League.The cinematography, the acting and the score are all second to none. This film is phenomenal.P.S: watch the 3 hour extended cut that Snyder intended you to see, not the 2 and a half hour movie that Warner Bros. decided would be better for theaters."

"I don't care what the critics say, this is a very well-done movie. I'll start my review by listing what I like about the movie.1.) Ben Affleck is the best batman to me and it is not close. He pulls off the role of an aging batman extremely well. Also, Zack Snyder's vision of batman is legit. I have always hated batman up until this adaptation of him. Instead of being a conflicted and idealistic batman, this batman is dark, gritty, and 100% a badass. His equipment is decked out with machine guns and he has no aversion to killing people. In fact, he probably kills about 50 criminal by the time this movie is over. The warehouse scene is the coolest batman scene in any movie.2.) The development of a grudge between batman and superman is pulled off flawlessly. It actually makes sense why batman dislikes superman. Then, when they do fight it is about the coolest thing you can expect to see from a superhero film. 3.) I disagree with a lot of people about Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor. In my opinion, he played his role to perfection. 4.) B v S sets up Wonder Woman and Justice League with Gal Gadot's cameo as Wonder Woman and short clips of Aquaman, the Flash, and Cyborg. B v S is one of my favorite superhero films and rewatching it never gets old."

"The theatrical cut of this film is garbage which is why I rated it eight stars instead of nine. The first time I watched this film I didn't like it (not straight out hate but didn't like). Character motivations didn't make any sense, Lex was annoying as s***, editing was sloppy, and it was overly dark and broody for an action superhero movie. A year + a half, five Marvel films, a ton of bad reviews and a Justice League later a thought popped into my head: \"what if I watched BVS again\". This time I didn't have trailers ruining the best moments, I only vaguely remembered the film, and I was conditioned to look at it negatively but something unexpected happened: I actually loved it. Superman was just a normal person that tried to make a difference cause he could that others imposed their own beliefs on. Lex Luthor was a genius that couldn't stand his powerlessness compared to Superman or more accurately a super being. As Alfred said \"The fever, the rage, the feeling of powerlessness that turns good men... cruel\" and you see the same thought process in Batman. Batman, just like Lex Luthor feels powerless in the midst of a god-being and just like Lex he attempts to destroy him so he can get his sense of power back but unlike Lex, Batman learns something. I what is one of the corniest lines of the movie Superman says, \"Martha\" when he knows he can't win against Batman in a late desperate attempt to save his mother. Not only does this name connect with Bruce Wayne but it also shows what really matters to a man of steel: it isn't power, it isn't fame or anything else, it is his Mother and on a broader scale it is people. Lex (who doesn't care about people at all) knows he doesn't have the power so he creates something from his blood and the remains of Zod: A Doomsday for Superman. Not only does this film have depth but it also doesn't always explain it to you which is rare in a blockbuster action superhero flick normally cater to semi-comic book fans and people that want to shove popcorn in their mouths. This film rewards you for really noticing the details while still having massive explosions. One of my favorites is how Lex has all of Batman's branded killed which is why he isn't afraid of the branding at the end or Grandma's Peach Tea as a way of scaring the s*** out of someone. Of course, this film isn't perfect and I do have personal dislikes. The Batman V Superman fight was slow and pretty boring especially after watching such an amazing fight in Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 2 (If you haven't watched the animated Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 1 and 2 you are sorely missing out on something fantastic). Also, the addition of Wonder Woman who pretty much steals a hacker thing, gives it back and then suits up and fights against a giant monster thing. Not to say I don't like Wonder Woman (She is one of my favorite Superheroes of all time who showed not only can woman kick a** but they also don't need to be ashamed of their sexuality or gender) but she wasn't really that helpful to the plot and just brought in to expand the universe which was well done through Lex's superhuman hunting files. Also, the post-apocalyptic scene that was just a dream could have been cut but nothing is perfect except movies like Citizen Kane which isn't a lot of fun to watch cause it is too perfect. So to summarize, the theatrical cut is bad, the ultimate cut is Amazing and the other cut is meh. Please give it a second chance because it deserves it and save a good director from losing grace because of something he didn't do."
"I really liked it, don't know what all the hate is about. I'm actually a Marvel fan from when I was 7 or so, but Superman and Batman together in 1 movie? Just great. And personally I like Ben Affleck even better than Christian Bale as Batman. So just watch and enjoy, I know I did!"

"That's right. We have been waiting for these two heroes to finally meet and fight against each other. This movie is so good in both plot and special effects.Henry Cavill and Ben Affleck have performed well in their acting stages. They are the best superhero actors and they have filmed their fighting scenes very well. The movie starts to show the conflict between the lives of the heroes and now they have blamed each other for it. This movie is amazing and sets up a good plot for Dawn Justice."

"Actually...I didn't know what to expect. When you see Wonder Woman, you know it will be off of Wonder Woman and off of a Wonder Woman story, but with Batman V Superman, I was like, \"hmmmm, so who is this about?\" It was pretty obvious that it would feature many characters, but I thought the introduction to Batman was amazing. Ben Affleck nailed the part, not only as Batman but also as Bruce Wayne. He is my Batman. Henry Cavill continued to be super as the Man of Steel. And he is my Super - Man. A dark story? Yes, without a doubt. Could it have had a few more jokes? Sure. But not all movies or stories need to have jokes when certain events are serious. I really hope people can see this review and take another look at the movie, because, I loved it. I really hope the ratings can go up, eventually. And P.S, this movie is the perfect set up to Justice League."

"I'll start by making it clear I have only ever seen the Ultimate Edition. I'm aware of what was cut out for the theatrical release, so I will concede up front that most of the criticisms about pacing, editing, and missing bits of plot at release were merited.With that caveat out of the way, I must reiterate that this was bar-none the boldest superhero movie I have ever seen. To me, it was arguably the best as well, though \"best\" shouldn't be taken to mean \"most enjoyable.\" That honor easily goes to \"Thor: Ragnarok.\" What makes BvS stand out among other films in the genre is that it takes two characters who have been done to death since the 1970s and brings them up to date. I recently tried to watch \"Superman: The Movie\" for the first time in a number of years, and while it was still good and Reeves will always be iconic, I just couldn't take it seriously. I'll put it this way: If the story in BvS was \"stupid\" in your view but Superman turning back time by spinning the earth backward on its axis didn't seem like one of the dumbest things you have ever seen -in any movie from any genre- to the extent that it outright ruins the movie for you, then your opinion about BvS isn't worth much. Nostalgic bias was always going to be a problem for this movie, and the way people reacted to and reviewed \"Man of Steel\" was telling in this regard.That brings me to Zack Snyder's take on Superman. You know, that guy whose status as the first extraterrestrial ever encountered by humanity was a total non-issue in the old movies. Apparently, Snyder has a similar view to my own in that his take on the Man of Steel makes his being an alien a core piece of his identity. He may look like any other (absurdly attractive) person, but he knows what he is, and that makes him perpetually uncertain of where he fits in this world. He is essentially good and really does care about people, but he struggles to truly empathize with the likes of us. To be human is to be frail, and that is not something he can easily relate to. This is the root of his conflict with Batman.Just as Clark struggles to genuinely relate to most people, Snyder's Batman either refuses to or otherwise just can't relate to Superman. He doesn't see him as anything but a threat regardless of Superman's clear good intentions. Remember, a small group of Kryptonians were able to bring humanity to the brink of extinction in less than a day, and Bruce Wayne is nothing if not a realist. He didn't know the guy from Kansas. He only knew the god from another world.While Batman's anger toward and fear of Superman are readily apparent from the start, Superman's inability to imagine things from Bruce Wayne's perspective only becomes truly apparent during their first real interaction. This reminded me of the animated version of the \"world's finest\" storyline, where Superman judges Batman harshly for using fear tactics and threats of violence (also, actual violence) to get the job done. Superman wasn't willing to consider what it would take for a human man to fight criminals and save innocents, or what that life would do to him over time. Just as Batman didn't see the guy from Kansas, Superman didn't see the man who lives his life trapped in one brutal, unthinkably traumatic moment (this was beautifully conveyed during the film's opening moments), and had spent his whole adult life bearing witness to humanity at its absolute worst.The conflict between these two characters is as old as human history. They want the same things, but they can't understand one another. So they fight. And what a fight it was.Watching a fight between, say, Captain America and Iron Man was, to me, more frustrating than anything because each understood the other's perspective perfectly. The fight between Batman and Superman in BvS was genuinely gut-wrenching, as intended, because they would have understood one another if either had tried. The whole sequence hilighted Batman's tactical prowess and ability to control a situation. Maybe the most badass thing about the fight was that it ended exactly where Batman planned. That brings me to the big elephant in the room named \"Martha.\"I can't recall exactly which YouTuber put it this way, but if you thought the \"save Martha\" exchange was about their mothers having the same name, you had your brain turned off. The brain-on people have explained this to death, but it bears repeating. This was the moment when Superman became humanized to Batman. He was about to die, and his only concern was for his adoptive human mother. He still believed that the man about to take his life would do the right thing. Even with the cowl on, there was no mistaking the look on Batman's face. It was the look of shame, guilt, and sudden uncertainty that says \"What am I doing?\" Turns out even the most brutal, angry version of Bruce Wayne is better than Tony Stark at knowing right from wrong. At knowing that he had gone too far.From there, the third act was a series of truly impressive (albeit mostly CGI) fight sequences, beginning with what I regard as the undisputed champion of Batman fights. Nothing in the Nolan movies (and especially nothing in the Burton movies) even came close. Go ahead, try to convince yourself that Batman and Bane taking turns punching one another in the face until Bane's mask broke was a good fight sequence. No, this was a fight straight out of \"Arkham Knight,\" and it was glorious. The battle against Doomsday really was one for the books. From the moment Wonder Woman arrived accompanied by the intense sounds of Tina Guo's electric cello to Superman's tragic, heroic death at the hands of Doomsday, I was glued to the screen. Sure, the mere presence of Doomsday spoiled the end to a degree, but watching the Man of Steel laboring to carry that kryptonite spear towards certain death was no less impactful. A brief word on Jesse Eisenberg's take on Lex Luthor. At least one other reviewer on this site already said it best when they pointed out that this was his origin story. If you consider his scheme objectively, he is actually one of the more formidable incarnations of the character. If we're lucky, we'll eventually get to see a Snyder Cut of \"Justice League\" and find out where this story was actually meant to go. For the record, Joss Whedon and Danny Elfman both should have said \"no\" to taking a dump on someone else's art."
"BATMAN V SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE brings a fantastic surprise to a smash-hit team-up with one of the worlds most beloved DC Comics' icons of all time. The movie delivers spectacular casting, and fantastic acting with different characters having their shine in each scenes.The story follows Clark Kent/Superman who becomes a threat, after the destruction in Metropolis in Man Of Steel.(2013). Batman/Bruce Wayne sees him as a threat and begins his war on Superman.The movie brings spectacular storytelling, it tells the complications of human against alien who are on the same side, and the first meeting of Batman and Superman. The story of Bruce Wayne, with his many years of The Caped Crusader, sends him on a spiral of \"out of control\", sheer anger, and builds tension to wanting to defeat the Man of Steel. Snyder has fantastically gave this storytelling an exciting nod to the comics.Lex Luthor, played by Jesse Einsberg, delivers a very interesting performance, but very differently by him showing is his \"origin\" before he becomes a bald foe to the Man of Steel. He shows that his love of \"god vs man\" terrorises mankind when he ultimately creates Doomsday, and Batman realises Superman's inner heroism.It packs so many great \"out of nowhere\" excitement, including a first-look of the fearful Wonder Woman a.k.a. Diana Prince, played by Gal Gadot, and a fresh-new glimpse of the superhero DC canon: The Justice League.WATCH THIS MOVIE! The critics are out of their mind. It's a fun-packed action adventure which still keeps the movie enjoyable until it's final minutes of the movie. It's a FANTASTIC MOVIE! BEN AFFLECK AS BATMAN... is Incredible!A 10/10 overall!"
"I want to go on record as saying that this is a truly thrilling cinematic experience in so many ways. If pressed, I guess I could acknowledge that there were a couple ... let's say \"clumsy\" moments. And in a film that runs to three hours, that hardly seems like a significant issue, certainly not enough to rate it with fewer than 9 stars.This film has everything. There is dramatic tension right from the start. There is a magnificent story arc that picks up quite seamlessly from 'Man of Steel' and propels the viewer not only into the life of Clark Kent/Superman but also of Bruce Wayne/Batman.The villain is no mere cartoon of a villain; he is truly thoroughly (and apparently irrevocably) diabolical. He is a psychopath, and you wish for his death over and over and over. You want Superman to reduce him to ash with the power of his eyes.I have read a number of viewers' reviews, and it seems that the people who disliked the film / gave it a low rating had rather unfair and unrealistic expectations of it. That is, their own prejudices about how the plot could/should unfold or what the character development could/should be, etc. ruined the film for them. And that is a shame.My thought is: I settle into my seat, wait for the lights to dim, and then I wait to be transported by the film. I accept it, lock, stock, and barrel.As another reviewer remarked, I love how the film begins from the point of view of Bruce Wayne as he is among people on the ground who have fallen victim to the attack of Zod and the other Kryptonians.Why would Bruce Wayne not like Superman? Why would the good people of Earth hurl insults at Superman and burn him in effigy (on the news)? Because the good people of Earth just got catapulted into a new reality in which there are not only extraterrestrial beings (surprise!) but they are also superman! And a group of them are hell-bent on destroying humankind and taking the planet for themselves.It is difficult to see Superman as separate from the whole Kryptonian Krew.It seems that many moviegoers forgot that Bruce Wayne is also human. Sure, he's a hero, but he is flawed.. Just like the rest of us. He is a vigilante, after all.He has let his vigilantism get the better of him. HE is actually the one working outside the boundaries of the law, not Superman. It is the clear head of Alfred that shows us that he has gone into a rather dark place, that he has not seen what is really going on (in Luthor's scheme), and so he chooses to embark on his own scheme scheme to take out the alien invader. He is (allegedly) thinking of the future: if he wipes out the all-powerful alien, then it can't turn on humankind in the future. At least, he convinces himself of that.A philosophical question is raised in the film: should Clark Kent have remained a simple man from Kansas and never have become the Superman? Should he just let people die and let calamities happen? The question is answered for us in the character of Diana Prince/Wonder Woman. She withdrew from mankind (her exact words) and just sat around watching. Watching while people died horrible deaths all around her. So, should Superman have done the same? Do these special beings, these 'metahumans', have some kind of moral imperative to intervene, or should they be allowed to be regular people, too? It seems that humans want it both ways.It seems that humans are saying: \"Don't be a superalien ... except when I and my friends and family are in trouble. Then come save us.\""

"Batman v Superman: Ultimate Edition: If your looking for a quick, cheap thrill then you might not enjoy this film at the time. This movies theatrical version was butchered by WB and in doing so reshaped the story leaving numerous plot holes. So the Ultimate Edition is the full story and the one worth seeing. Watch 'Man of Steel' before seeing this movie. There is much to claw through here, so much so that the audience might easily find themselves exhausted from the overall aggression of the film. However, a lot of the story does work. The action is good, and the emotion feels real most of the time.This film is about Superman trying to become Superman. Trying to help the world, save people, find a place in this world not as an outcast, and yet is looked at has a threat by many. Superman is not from this world, yet He is trying to be human, find a place in this world, be excepted by earths people, and come into his destiny.This film is also about Batman being Batman for 20 years and losing faith in humanity, and fearing Superman, what Superman can do with his powers. Great film, great plot, great visuals. ---Yidioo"
"I didn't see the film in the theaters and just bought the \"Extended Edition \" on Amazon. I never properly saw Man of Steel- i think I rented it and watched it when already exhausted and fell asleep. I saw the mediocre user reviews and horrible reviews from critics of this film.They really have it wrong. This is the very best either Batman or Superman. It has a different take, on things. Much darker then earlier films even darker then the Christopher Nolan Batman films.First of all Christopher Nolan is an Executive Producer. So how bad could it be? I loved Sucker Punch and Zack Snyder was involved with that. So how bad could this be? Hans Zimmer did the music, so how bad could it be?I remember watching the old Superman TV shows and reading the Superman and Batman comics as a little kid and loved them, but i wouldn't call myself a \"fan boy\" of comic universes, like so many younger people today. As an older adult I will admit my favorite TV show of all time was Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but watched it on DVD only after it had finished. I saw the second of the Dark Knight series in the theater, but the other two, I watched on DVD. They were great, but not my favorite films like so many people. i also loved the first couple Superman and Batman films in the older series. Regardless, i was not waiting with baited breath to see Man of Steel or this one.I'm more of a serious film fan, who can watch Stanley Kubrick films over and over and my favorite films in the last twenty years, are Eyes Wide Shut and Intersteller, both of which i've watched multiple times.So, with that said, take it from me, the critics have this film very wrong, just as critics hated 2001: A Space Odyssey when it first came out. This film will have lasting appreciation.Surprised how much I liked Ben Afleck's Batman. it was hard to get into Henry Cavil's scrawnier looking Superman, but it grew on me. Amy Adams was great as Lois Lane, The Gal Gadol Wonder Women was amazing. Lex Luther was terrific, like Nolan's Joker. Jeremy Irons was the best Alfred ever. Holly Hunter and Diane Lane was good too. The movie had bad reviews but made a billion dollars. Hopefully everyone buys the Ultimate Edition and it breaks sales records and the film is re-appreciated. I have no idea what scenes this Ultimate Edition added, but it is pretty perfect. Now I can't wait for Wonder Woman and the Justice League and as soon as I finish writing this am going to watch Man of Steal. I'm into it now!I can only surmise that the bad reviews stem from too much expectations of the rigid fan boy types and the radical changes in tone, we see in this film.Total masterpiece of cinema, but I have a few criticisms. There are a few hollow scenes of typical Idiot cops and authorities getting everything wrong in a cliché type way and it has a few filler scenes of that type and a few moments here and there that felt rushed and cheesy. Maybe not everything restored into the Ultimate Edition should have been. I wish there had been more Kevin Costner scenes."

"The whole entire Batman V Superman movie was great and yes even though it felt slow to the majority of the people who watched it but to me I enjoyed every part and every scene of Batman V Superman and when it got to the fight scenes both batman VS Superman and the Doomsday fight it brought so much drama, intensity, and epic performances. So with that being said I give this movie a good 10/10 because it really did go to my expectations and it brought a powerful performance and a powerful yet epic introduction to the upcoming Justice League."

"When I first wrote a review for this movie a year ago exclaiming my excitement for the film, I had been high off a fresh dose of live-action DC superheroes playing out the beloved comic book stories that I had grown up on. It was all playing out before my eyes and coming to life. After a few months had passed, I began to notice things about the movie that I disliked: little gaps in the story, things that didn't add up, etc. My original rating of a 10 / 10 dropped to an 8 /10. But today it has gone back up to a 10. The extended version of the film not only rectifies the gaps but also silences critics.Many claimed that the movie was too dark or that it just didn't make sense. To those people, I say: \"Pick up a comic book!\" Many of the critics of this particular film were part of the superhero bandwagon that formed when Marvel began its spree of Avengers-related films. In fact, its estimated that over 60% of people who go to see 'superhero' genre films have never picked up a comic book in their life. I would argue that similar numbers could figure to those which view the CW televised DC Universe shows. People complain that DC comics is just too dark but the fact is that these movies are based upon actual comics which are meant to be dark (ex: The Dark Knight Returns, Injustice, etc.). Its like complaining that Game of Thrones (the TV series) sucks because they kill off too many characters. Read the books! Its frustrating to see such a beautiful work of art like Batman V Superman criticized by those ignorant to its universe and its meaning. This movie is in fact a catalyst that opens numerous doorways and leaves true fans in awe of the possibilities for future movies. But regardless of whether or not people choose to educate themselves, this film's DVD/Blu-ray extended version puts the theater release to shame. All of the plot holes and gaps are filled in 30 minutes of extended footage scattered throughout the film. The movie ultimately becomes more complete and people will wish that the movie had shown the full 3 hours of footage in its theatrical debut. As a major DC comics fan, I will of course pick up on things that a comics fan would not, but someone who does not read comics would learn to appreciate this film in its entirety with the extended version. Get your hands on a copy today or find it on Netflix or the internet somewhere!"

"I ignored the bad reviews and watched anyways. This film had a lot to live up to after Civil War was released and I went into this film expecting the worst. It ended up to be the best Superhero film of 2016 to me. One complaint was that this film was more concerned about universe building than telling a great story than Civil War but for me it was the other way around; Civil War felt like a build up to something else and to be honest, I felt that way when I saw the other MCU films. Batman vs Superman however not only had a great story, but it also felt a lot more consistent than Civil War. This film was way more diverse with the cast than the MCU but unlike the MCU, I felt like this film doesn't go overboard with the SJW stuff like the MCU films or The Star Wars Sequel films do. The Visuals were AMAZING, The Score by Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL was AMAZING as well, The Tone is just right as I actually felt for the characters emotionally, The Cinematography kept my eyes glued to the screen, and the script felt really Intelligent and Complex and despite people calling the writing confusing, I was able to piece it together with no problem whatsoever. This film is similar to Empire Strikes back in terms of popularity so over time after the other movies are released, this movie would probably be more popular.This film was way better than I Expected and deserves another chance.

"Its shame to see what critics and marvel fans did to this movie and targeted Zack Snyder for it. I have seen this movie more than 25 times till date. And i enjoy this movie as much as i enjoyed the first time. The fans who have read DC comics, wouldn't be disappointed in this movie. Its dark movie, yes it is. Because the title shows the intense situation at hand. Two superheroes about to rip each other apart for whatever reasons that brought them to this stage. Yes it had to be dark and intense.Only marvel can be stupid enough to show an alien invasion where humans are loosing the battle and the super heroes are cracking jokes while battles as if they are playing ping pong. a person playing Call of Duty game is more serious while playing than the marvel heroes fighting aliens."

"Last week some news came out from somebody online who had claimed to have seen a finished version of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. If you were like me, you've been leery of checking it out because you weren't sure how much might actually be true. Now Zack Snyder has spoken out about the spoiler-filled post, although his response doesn't really clear anything up.In a word, to MTV, he called the post \"hilarious,which might imply that he's saying that it's mostly, if not entirely, untrue. That might be the case, but then again he could have just said it was untrue and he didn't say that. What he did say, however, is that he doesn't like spoilers. While this may seem odd for the director who's most recent trailer appeared to give away the entire movie, Snyder says that's not the case. Even if you've seen the trailer, you can rest easy, as there is much more we have not seen in then finished film. Says Snyder I have the benefit of seeing the movie. It's cool that think it's too much, and I appreciate people not wanting to know, but there's plenty that they don't know. There's a lot of movie that's not in the trailer. In the process of calling the Batman v Superman Reddit review hilarious, Snyder goes on to talk about how he hates it when spoilers come out. The director would much rather that fans see the movie mostly blind. While he understands that some fans may wish to find the answers before hand, he wants his movies to be mysteries going in. If you're, as an audience member, exploring these articles, looking for answers to questions that you have, maybe you're okay with knowing before you go. It's like an individual taste. But like I said, I want people to see the movie without knowing.Spoilers are a topic that mean different things to different people. While most try to avoid them to some degree, the need to solve the mystery is a nearly universal human experience. We have an inclination to want to know the truth, even while also wanting to be surprised. For most of us getting some information is good, but getting all the information is bad, of course, only getting the details that you want can be difficult."
"The theatrical is choppy, poorly edited, hard to follow, with some really good moments mixed in their. The extended is much more fluent and is much easier to follow, it does have a long runtime, which might make it seem a bit dragging on, but if you like long films done right, like Lord of the Rings, you will like this movie as long as you get into the characters and story. Speaking of which, the story starts out perfectly showing Bruce Wayne as a character, and it is very powerful. There are several moments in this movie that are powerful, emotional, and shocking. Characters. Batman is my favorite fictional character of all time, and believe me when I say, Ben Affleck as Batman was perfect, he had the charisma, the anger, and the look of being through some bad stuff Gal Gadot also does perfect as Wonder Woman, but if you want to really see how good she does, go watch the Wonder Woman movie. Henry Call as Superman. I really don't like it when people say Christopher Reeves is better. Don't get me wrong, Reeves does great, but can you imagine him as Superman in this movie? I wouldn't like it. It would be like Adam West playing Batman in The Dark Knight. Henry Cavill does great in this role, I can say everything about him as I said with Ben Affleck. Jesse Eisenberg as Luthor. I thought it was different in a good way. I've heard a criticism for him as being too much like Joker, but is that a bad thing? Joker is my favorite villain, so to see Superman have an enemy that crazy, but still hold the values Luthor needs to be Luthor, I think it is great. The thing I thought this movie was lacking in the first and second acts was humor, at least good humor. If there was more humor, I would've given this movie a ten because it would give a more relaxing feel to the parts that needed it. All in all though, this movie was awesome, it had powerful moments, it was badass, and just plain fun. It had a great story arc and does its job very well."

"*I will be talking about the Ultimate Edition of the film* This was one of the most anticipated CBM of all time. Ever since the arrival and subsequent success of Marvel's The Avengers people have wondered when will DC launch its own cinematic universe, one of the main reasons being the opportunity to finally see titans such as Batman and Superman share the screen together: the ultimate nerd dream. On 2016, the moment finally came for BvS to be released AND.. it performed poorly. Not only did critical reception left a lot to be desired, but fan reactions where surprisingly split after its cinematic debut. People either loved it and called Zack a genius, or hated it and called him a hack. Me, personally, I found myself with middle of the road feelings, for sure, but more leaning towards the negative side with subsequent viewings. The theatrical cut of the film showcased amazing performances, incredible visuals, and action set pieces that seemed like comic book panels come to life, in a good way. However, when it comes to its narrative structure and more technical aspects like editing, the film was seriously flawed. More plot holes than Age of Ultron, questionable character decisions, random editing that lacked cohesion and focus, and forced dramatic moments that lacked any impact because the attempts at character development ranged from limited to nonexistent, especially when it comes to Superman's character. I thought it was a 5/10 movie at best. As such, I was kind of skeptical about the idea of a 30 minute longer version. I say kind of because I know how Zack works. I remember Watchmen being vastly improved with its director's cut, so in a way I was expecting BvS to perform in a similar manner, but I also feared those 30 minutes wold be just there to amplify action and discredit storytelling issues. Oh boy, I'm so glad I was proved wrong. The ultimate cut of the film was infuriating, but not because it was awful, but because it questions the sanity of WB executives and editors and makes you wonder what were they thinking during the editing process. What I got out of the Ultimate Edition was a thought-provoking deconstruction of two very iconic superheroes that gave spotlight to the struggles both of them face when they aren't fighting crime. What I got was an extremely well produced character study on both Batman and Superman in a cynical world, a world dangerously close to our own. We meet Batman as a ruthless, worn out hero that has seen the failure behind his ideals and witnessed some truly horrifying things in his life. Superman, on the other hand, is portrayed as a godlike figure that seeks to do good in the world, but finds himself emotionally conflicted once he realized that every good deed he does leaves behind a trail of destruction (most of it due to Luthor's antics). In my opinion, this is a hugely original approach, one that distances itself from the rest of the competition and delivers a dark, somber, yet relevant superhero movie that understands both characters and gives them real human struggles to deal with. I felt invested in both of them, and hoped that by the end of the film both could find a way to redeem themselves. Their character arcs were very well established during the first two acts of the movie, and by the time we get to the titular climactic battle the emotion behind the jaw-dropping action is intensified. Lex Luthor as a villain was also given more time to develop with this new edition. One of the main criticisms with the original version was the fact that his plan relied too much on conveniences, and the character's mannerisms and mad-scientist attitude was annoying, and that goes without saying his motivations were unclear. Not only do we spend more time understanding his hate for any godlike figure and thus his hatred for Superman, but the added scenes allowed us to witness his entire plan come to fruition. It sells the cold, manipulative, calculating attributes of his comic counterpart. The acting is spot on. Every actor owns his/her role, from Cavill's Superman, to Ben Affleck as Batman, Eisenberg as Luthor, and Gadot as Wonder Woman, whose scenes are brief, but are more than enough to sell the strong and ferocious warrior that she is. Cinematography is stunning, and miles above that of Man of Steel's. And the soundtrack by Zimmer and Junkie XL? Perfect, just perfect. When it comes to flaws, the film still has some of those. The Martha moment, while serving as a pivotal character moment for Batman, felt off in execution, and its understandable that many people got mad at it. If your main complaint about BvS the first time around was its bleak tone and subject matter, this film is still not for you. I understand most were expecting to see the heroes being the most iconic versions of themselves, clashing in an elongated battle and evoking the same feelings The Avengers gave audiences back in 2012. In that sense, the film will remain divisive, but at least I have the comfort of saying that, at the very least, the film is competently made."

"This film was amazing. Ben Affleck was easily the best part of this movie, he brought his a-game as Batman. The chemistry between Affleck & Irons was outstanding. Gal Gadot did a great job as Wonder Woman. The fight between Batman & Superman was awesome. The final fight with Doomsday was outstanding in every way possible. However, there is only one problem with this film and that's Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor. He was sadly missed cast in this role, but then again it's really the fault of Warner Bros. Studios. Overall, this film deliver on almost every level. I highly recommend that you watch the extended version of this film."

"I know I know. I saw it in theaters too, and felt like it could've been so much better. While the Batman element was good, the narrative felt fractured, and the third act was just one long stunt scene. Superman was relegated to a supporting character, and other characters didn't get a chance to shine. And then I chanced on the ultimate cut. Calling it 30 mins of \"extra\" footage is unfair to Zack Snyder because it's exactly these 30 mins that makes the movie a worthy one. What I can say about the theatrical cut is this - It had the blockbuster elements - music, visuals, stunts, CGI. But, it lacked the human elements. The first 20 mins of the movie had it, but not after that. The extended cut in comparison has a flow to the narrative. There are no disjointed scenes, everything flows smoothly, and there's connective tissue. Superman gets to spend some time with his father, and mother. Clark Kent does some investigative journalism. Superman helps the people after the blast. Lois Lane doesn't jump to conclusions, she gets to the bottom of the crime. Lex Luthor apparently had a coherent plan - everything is explained pretty well. Wonder Woman was already good, so there's no change there :) Also, the \"Martha\" scene seems better executed, because it is a few seconds longer, and there's time to breathe it in. So, here's my take on this movie - The theatrical cut was junk. Get the Bluray for ultimate edition, and you shall not be disappointed. I've seen it so many more times now, and it's the definitive cut. It is the movie we deserve. It's a unique take on Batman, and Superman. It's a gritty take on the superhero movie genre, and definitely the best DCEU movie, and the best DC movie since The Dark Knight.P.S. Yes it's dark. We're adults, and we should appreciate mature film making without intentionally silly moments. It attempts to be philosophical, and something deep instead of just trying to make you chuckle."

"This is one of the best superhero movies ever made. Zack Snyder is a magician behind the camera.The reason behind so many complaints is the fact that Warner Bros. marketed this movie as a fight between Batman and Superman. That's not what it is. It's a movie about the origins of the Justice League.The cinematography, the acting and the score are all second to none. This film is phenomenal.P.S: watch the 3 hour extended cut that Snyder intended you to see, not the 2 and a half hour movie that Warner Bros. decided would be better for theaters."

"I don't care what the critics say, this is a very well-done movie. I'll start my review by listing what I like about the movie.1.) Ben Affleck is the best batman to me and it is not close. He pulls off the role of an aging batman extremely well. Also, Zack Snyder's vision of batman is legit. I have always hated batman up until this adaptation of him. Instead of being a conflicted and idealistic batman, this batman is dark, gritty, and 100% a badass. His equipment is decked out with machine guns and he has no aversion to killing people. In fact, he probably kills about 50 criminal by the time this movie is over. The warehouse scene is the coolest batman scene in any movie.2.) The development of a grudge between batman and superman is pulled off flawlessly. It actually makes sense why batman dislikes superman. Then, when they do fight it is about the coolest thing you can expect to see from a superhero film. 3.) I disagree with a lot of people about Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor. In my opinion, he played his role to perfection. 4.) B v S sets up Wonder Woman and Justice League with Gal Gadot's cameo as Wonder Woman and short clips of Aquaman, the Flash, and Cyborg. B v S is one of my favorite superhero films and rewatching it never gets old."

"The theatrical cut of this film is garbage which is why I rated it eight stars instead of nine. The first time I watched this film I didn't like it (not straight out hate but didn't like). Character motivations didn't make any sense, Lex was annoying as s***, editing was sloppy, and it was overly dark and broody for an action superhero movie. A year + a half, five Marvel films, a ton of bad reviews and a Justice League later a thought popped into my head: \"what if I watched BVS again\". This time I didn't have trailers ruining the best moments, I only vaguely remembered the film, and I was conditioned to look at it negatively but something unexpected happened: I actually loved it. Superman was just a normal person that tried to make a difference cause he could that others imposed their own beliefs on. Lex Luthor was a genius that couldn't stand his powerlessness compared to Superman or more accurately a super being. As Alfred said \"The fever, the rage, the feeling of powerlessness that turns good men... cruel\" and you see the same thought process in Batman. Batman, just like Lex Luthor feels powerless in the midst of a god-being and just like Lex he attempts to destroy him so he can get his sense of power back but unlike Lex, Batman learns something. I what is one of the corniest lines of the movie Superman says, \"Martha\" when he knows he can't win against Batman in a late desperate attempt to save his mother. Not only does this name connect with Bruce Wayne but it also shows what really matters to a man of steel: it isn't power, it isn't fame or anything else, it is his Mother and on a broader scale it is people. Lex (who doesn't care about people at all) knows he doesn't have the power so he creates something from his blood and the remains of Zod: A Doomsday for Superman. Not only does this film have depth but it also doesn't always explain it to you which is rare in a blockbuster action superhero flick normally cater to semi-comic book fans and people that want to shove popcorn in their mouths. This film rewards you for really noticing the details while still having massive explosions. One of my favorites is how Lex has all of Batman's branded killed which is why he isn't afraid of the branding at the end or Grandma's Peach Tea as a way of scaring the s*** out of someone. Of course, this film isn't perfect and I do have personal dislikes. The Batman V Superman fight was slow and pretty boring especially after watching such an amazing fight in Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 2 (If you haven't watched the animated Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 1 and 2 you are sorely missing out on something fantastic). Also, the addition of Wonder Woman who pretty much steals a hacker thing, gives it back and then suits up and fights against a giant monster thing. Not to say I don't like Wonder Woman (She is one of my favorite Superheroes of all time who showed not only can woman kick a** but they also don't need to be ashamed of their sexuality or gender) but she wasn't really that helpful to the plot and just brought in to expand the universe which was well done through Lex's superhuman hunting files. Also, the post-apocalyptic scene that was just a dream could have been cut but nothing is perfect except movies like Citizen Kane which isn't a lot of fun to watch cause it is too perfect. So to summarize, the theatrical cut is bad, the ultimate cut is Amazing and the other cut is meh. Please give it a second chance because it deserves it and save a good director from losing grace because of something he didn't do."
"I really liked it, don't know what all the hate is about. I'm actually a Marvel fan from when I was 7 or so, but Superman and Batman together in 1 movie? Just great. And personally I like Ben Affleck even better than Christian Bale as Batman. So just watch and enjoy, I know I did!"

"That's right. We have been waiting for these two heroes to finally meet and fight against each other. This movie is so good in both plot and special effects.Henry Cavill and Ben Affleck have performed well in their acting stages. They are the best superhero actors and they have filmed their fighting scenes very well. The movie starts to show the conflict between the lives of the heroes and now they have blamed each other for it. This movie is amazing and sets up a good plot for Dawn Justice."

"Actually...I didn't know what to expect. When you see Wonder Woman, you know it will be off of Wonder Woman and off of a Wonder Woman story, but with Batman V Superman, I was like, \"hmmmm, so who is this about?\" It was pretty obvious that it would feature many characters, but I thought the introduction to Batman was amazing. Ben Affleck nailed the part, not only as Batman but also as Bruce Wayne. He is my Batman. Henry Cavill continued to be super as the Man of Steel. And he is my Super - Man. A dark story? Yes, without a doubt. Could it have had a few more jokes? Sure. But not all movies or stories need to have jokes when certain events are serious. I really hope people can see this review and take another look at the movie, because, I loved it. I really hope the ratings can go up, eventually. And P.S, this movie is the perfect set up to Justice League."

"I'll start by making it clear I have only ever seen the Ultimate Edition. I'm aware of what was cut out for the theatrical release, so I will concede up front that most of the criticisms about pacing, editing, and missing bits of plot at release were merited.With that caveat out of the way, I must reiterate that this was bar-none the boldest superhero movie I have ever seen. To me, it was arguably the best as well, though \"best\" shouldn't be taken to mean \"most enjoyable.\" That honor easily goes to \"Thor: Ragnarok.\" What makes BvS stand out among other films in the genre is that it takes two characters who have been done to death since the 1970s and brings them up to date. I recently tried to watch \"Superman: The Movie\" for the first time in a number of years, and while it was still good and Reeves will always be iconic, I just couldn't take it seriously. I'll put it this way: If the story in BvS was \"stupid\" in your view but Superman turning back time by spinning the earth backward on its axis didn't seem like one of the dumbest things you have ever seen -in any movie from any genre- to the extent that it outright ruins the movie for you, then your opinion about BvS isn't worth much. Nostalgic bias was always going to be a problem for this movie, and the way people reacted to and reviewed \"Man of Steel\" was telling in this regard.That brings me to Zack Snyder's take on Superman. You know, that guy whose status as the first extraterrestrial ever encountered by humanity was a total non-issue in the old movies. Apparently, Snyder has a similar view to my own in that his take on the Man of Steel makes his being an alien a core piece of his identity. He may look like any other (absurdly attractive) person, but he knows what he is, and that makes him perpetually uncertain of where he fits in this world. He is essentially good and really does care about people, but he struggles to truly empathize with the likes of us. To be human is to be frail, and that is not something he can easily relate to. This is the root of his conflict with Batman.Just as Clark struggles to genuinely relate to most people, Snyder's Batman either refuses to or otherwise just can't relate to Superman. He doesn't see him as anything but a threat regardless of Superman's clear good intentions. Remember, a small group of Kryptonians were able to bring humanity to the brink of extinction in less than a day, and Bruce Wayne is nothing if not a realist. He didn't know the guy from Kansas. He only knew the god from another world.While Batman's anger toward and fear of Superman are readily apparent from the start, Superman's inability to imagine things from Bruce Wayne's perspective only becomes truly apparent during their first real interaction. This reminded me of the animated version of the \"world's finest\" storyline, where Superman judges Batman harshly for using fear tactics and threats of violence (also, actual violence) to get the job done. Superman wasn't willing to consider what it would take for a human man to fight criminals and save innocents, or what that life would do to him over time. Just as Batman didn't see the guy from Kansas, Superman didn't see the man who lives his life trapped in one brutal, unthinkably traumatic moment (this was beautifully conveyed during the film's opening moments), and had spent his whole adult life bearing witness to humanity at its absolute worst.The conflict between these two characters is as old as human history. They want the same things, but they can't understand one another. So they fight. And what a fight it was.Watching a fight between, say, Captain America and Iron Man was, to me, more frustrating than anything because each understood the other's perspective perfectly. The fight between Batman and Superman in BvS was genuinely gut-wrenching, as intended, because they would have understood one another if either had tried. The whole sequence hilighted Batman's tactical prowess and ability to control a situation. Maybe the most badass thing about the fight was that it ended exactly where Batman planned. That brings me to the big elephant in the room named \"Martha.\"I can't recall exactly which YouTuber put it this way, but if you thought the \"save Martha\" exchange was about their mothers having the same name, you had your brain turned off. The brain-on people have explained this to death, but it bears repeating. This was the moment when Superman became humanized to Batman. He was about to die, and his only concern was for his adoptive human mother. He still believed that the man about to take his life would do the right thing. Even with the cowl on, there was no mistaking the look on Batman's face. It was the look of shame, guilt, and sudden uncertainty that says \"What am I doing?\" Turns out even the most brutal, angry version of Bruce Wayne is better than Tony Stark at knowing right from wrong. At knowing that he had gone too far.From there, the third act was a series of truly impressive (albeit mostly CGI) fight sequences, beginning with what I regard as the undisputed champion of Batman fights. Nothing in the Nolan movies (and especially nothing in the Burton movies) even came close. Go ahead, try to convince yourself that Batman and Bane taking turns punching one another in the face until Bane's mask broke was a good fight sequence. No, this was a fight straight out of \"Arkham Knight,\" and it was glorious. The battle against Doomsday really was one for the books. From the moment Wonder Woman arrived accompanied by the intense sounds of Tina Guo's electric cello to Superman's tragic, heroic death at the hands of Doomsday, I was glued to the screen. Sure, the mere presence of Doomsday spoiled the end to a degree, but watching the Man of Steel laboring to carry that kryptonite spear towards certain death was no less impactful. A brief word on Jesse Eisenberg's take on Lex Luthor. At least one other reviewer on this site already said it best when they pointed out that this was his origin story. If you consider his scheme objectively, he is actually one of the more formidable incarnations of the character. If we're lucky, we'll eventually get to see a Snyder Cut of \"Justice League\" and find out where this story was actually meant to go. For the record, Joss Whedon and Danny Elfman both should have said \"no\" to taking a dump on someone else's art."
"BATMAN V SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE brings a fantastic surprise to a smash-hit team-up with one of the worlds most beloved DC Comics' icons of all time. The movie delivers spectacular casting, and fantastic acting with different characters having their shine in each scenes.The story follows Clark Kent/Superman who becomes a threat, after the destruction in Metropolis in Man Of Steel.(2013). Batman/Bruce Wayne sees him as a threat and begins his war on Superman.The movie brings spectacular storytelling, it tells the complications of human against alien who are on the same side, and the first meeting of Batman and Superman. The story of Bruce Wayne, with his many years of The Caped Crusader, sends him on a spiral of \"out of control\", sheer anger, and builds tension to wanting to defeat the Man of Steel. Snyder has fantastically gave this storytelling an exciting nod to the comics.Lex Luthor, played by Jesse Einsberg, delivers a very interesting performance, but very differently by him showing is his \"origin\" before he becomes a bald foe to the Man of Steel. He shows that his love of \"god vs man\" terrorises mankind when he ultimately creates Doomsday, and Batman realises Superman's inner heroism.It packs so many great \"out of nowhere\" excitement, including a first-look of the fearful Wonder Woman a.k.a. Diana Prince, played by Gal Gadot, and a fresh-new glimpse of the superhero DC canon: The Justice League.WATCH THIS MOVIE! The critics are out of their mind. It's a fun-packed action adventure which still keeps the movie enjoyable until it's final minutes of the movie. It's a FANTASTIC MOVIE! BEN AFFLECK AS BATMAN... is Incredible!A 10/10 overall!"
"I want to go on record as saying that this is a truly thrilling cinematic experience in so many ways. If pressed, I guess I could acknowledge that there were a couple ... let's say \"clumsy\" moments. And in a film that runs to three hours, that hardly seems like a significant issue, certainly not enough to rate it with fewer than 9 stars.This film has everything. There is dramatic tension right from the start. There is a magnificent story arc that picks up quite seamlessly from 'Man of Steel' and propels the viewer not only into the life of Clark Kent/Superman but also of Bruce Wayne/Batman.The villain is no mere cartoon of a villain; he is truly thoroughly (and apparently irrevocably) diabolical. He is a psychopath, and you wish for his death over and over and over. You want Superman to reduce him to ash with the power of his eyes.I have read a number of viewers' reviews, and it seems that the people who disliked the film / gave it a low rating had rather unfair and unrealistic expectations of it. That is, their own prejudices about how the plot could/should unfold or what the character development could/should be, etc. ruined the film for them. And that is a shame.My thought is: I settle into my seat, wait for the lights to dim, and then I wait to be transported by the film. I accept it, lock, stock, and barrel.As another reviewer remarked, I love how the film begins from the point of view of Bruce Wayne as he is among people on the ground who have fallen victim to the attack of Zod and the other Kryptonians.Why would Bruce Wayne not like Superman? Why would the good people of Earth hurl insults at Superman and burn him in effigy (on the news)? Because the good people of Earth just got catapulted into a new reality in which there are not only extraterrestrial beings (surprise!) but they are also superman! And a group of them are hell-bent on destroying humankind and taking the planet for themselves.It is difficult to see Superman as separate from the whole Kryptonian Krew.It seems that many moviegoers forgot that Bruce Wayne is also human. Sure, he's a hero, but he is flawed.. Just like the rest of us. He is a vigilante, after all.He has let his vigilantism get the better of him. HE is actually the one working outside the boundaries of the law, not Superman. It is the clear head of Alfred that shows us that he has gone into a rather dark place, that he has not seen what is really going on (in Luthor's scheme), and so he chooses to embark on his own scheme scheme to take out the alien invader. He is (allegedly) thinking of the future: if he wipes out the all-powerful alien, then it can't turn on humankind in the future. At least, he convinces himself of that.A philosophical question is raised in the film: should Clark Kent have remained a simple man from Kansas and never have become the Superman? Should he just let people die and let calamities happen? The question is answered for us in the character of Diana Prince/Wonder Woman. She withdrew from mankind (her exact words) and just sat around watching. Watching while people died horrible deaths all around her. So, should Superman have done the same? Do these special beings, these 'metahumans', have some kind of moral imperative to intervene, or should they be allowed to be regular people, too? It seems that humans want it both ways.It seems that humans are saying: \"Don't be a superalien ... except when I and my friends and family are in trouble. Then come save us.\""

"Batman v Superman: Ultimate Edition: If your looking for a quick, cheap thrill then you might not enjoy this film at the time. This movies theatrical version was butchered by WB and in doing so reshaped the story leaving numerous plot holes. So the Ultimate Edition is the full story and the one worth seeing. Watch 'Man of Steel' before seeing this movie. There is much to claw through here, so much so that the audience might easily find themselves exhausted from the overall aggression of the film. However, a lot of the story does work. The action is good, and the emotion feels real most of the time.This film is about Superman trying to become Superman. Trying to help the world, save people, find a place in this world not as an outcast, and yet is looked at has a threat by many. Superman is not from this world, yet He is trying to be human, find a place in this world, be excepted by earths people, and come into his destiny.This film is also about Batman being Batman for 20 years and losing faith in humanity, and fearing Superman, what Superman can do with his powers. Great film, great plot, great visuals. ---Yidioo"
"I didn't see the film in the theaters and just bought the \"Extended Edition \" on Amazon. I never properly saw Man of Steel- i think I rented it and watched it when already exhausted and fell asleep. I saw the mediocre user reviews and horrible reviews from critics of this film.They really have it wrong. This is the very best either Batman or Superman. It has a different take, on things. Much darker then earlier films even darker then the Christopher Nolan Batman films.First of all Christopher Nolan is an Executive Producer. So how bad could it be? I loved Sucker Punch and Zack Snyder was involved with that. So how bad could this be? Hans Zimmer did the music, so how bad could it be?I remember watching the old Superman TV shows and reading the Superman and Batman comics as a little kid and loved them, but i wouldn't call myself a \"fan boy\" of comic universes, like so many younger people today. As an older adult I will admit my favorite TV show of all time was Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but watched it on DVD only after it had finished. I saw the second of the Dark Knight series in the theater, but the other two, I watched on DVD. They were great, but not my favorite films like so many people. i also loved the first couple Superman and Batman films in the older series. Regardless, i was not waiting with baited breath to see Man of Steel or this one.I'm more of a serious film fan, who can watch Stanley Kubrick films over and over and my favorite films in the last twenty years, are Eyes Wide Shut and Intersteller, both of which i've watched multiple times.So, with that said, take it from me, the critics have this film very wrong, just as critics hated 2001: A Space Odyssey when it first came out. This film will have lasting appreciation.Surprised how much I liked Ben Afleck's Batman. it was hard to get into Henry Cavil's scrawnier looking Superman, but it grew on me. Amy Adams was great as Lois Lane, The Gal Gadol Wonder Women was amazing. Lex Luther was terrific, like Nolan's Joker. Jeremy Irons was the best Alfred ever. Holly Hunter and Diane Lane was good too. The movie had bad reviews but made a billion dollars. Hopefully everyone buys the Ultimate Edition and it breaks sales records and the film is re-appreciated. I have no idea what scenes this Ultimate Edition added, but it is pretty perfect. Now I can't wait for Wonder Woman and the Justice League and as soon as I finish writing this am going to watch Man of Steal. I'm into it now!I can only surmise that the bad reviews stem from too much expectations of the rigid fan boy types and the radical changes in tone, we see in this film.Total masterpiece of cinema, but I have a few criticisms. There are a few hollow scenes of typical Idiot cops and authorities getting everything wrong in a cliché type way and it has a few filler scenes of that type and a few moments here and there that felt rushed and cheesy. Maybe not everything restored into the Ultimate Edition should have been. I wish there had been more Kevin Costner scenes."

"The whole entire Batman V Superman movie was great and yes even though it felt slow to the majority of the people who watched it but to me I enjoyed every part and every scene of Batman V Superman and when it got to the fight scenes both batman VS Superman and the Doomsday fight it brought so much drama, intensity, and epic performances. So with that being said I give this movie a good 10/10 because it really did go to my expectations and it brought a powerful performance and a powerful yet epic introduction to the upcoming Justice League."

"When I first wrote a review for this movie a year ago exclaiming my excitement for the film, I had been high off a fresh dose of live-action DC superheroes playing out the beloved comic book stories that I had grown up on. It was all playing out before my eyes and coming to life. After a few months had passed, I began to notice things about the movie that I disliked: little gaps in the story, things that didn't add up, etc. My original rating of a 10 / 10 dropped to an 8 /10. But today it has gone back up to a 10. The extended version of the film not only rectifies the gaps but also silences critics.Many claimed that the movie was too dark or that it just didn't make sense. To those people, I say: \"Pick up a comic book!\" Many of the critics of this particular film were part of the superhero bandwagon that formed when Marvel began its spree of Avengers-related films. In fact, its estimated that over 60% of people who go to see 'superhero' genre films have never picked up a comic book in their life. I would argue that similar numbers could figure to those which view the CW televised DC Universe shows. People complain that DC comics is just too dark but the fact is that these movies are based upon actual comics which are meant to be dark (ex: The Dark Knight Returns, Injustice, etc.). Its like complaining that Game of Thrones (the TV series) sucks because they kill off too many characters. Read the books! Its frustrating to see such a beautiful work of art like Batman V Superman criticized by those ignorant to its universe and its meaning. This movie is in fact a catalyst that opens numerous doorways and leaves true fans in awe of the possibilities for future movies. But regardless of whether or not people choose to educate themselves, this film's DVD/Blu-ray extended version puts the theater release to shame. All of the plot holes and gaps are filled in 30 minutes of extended footage scattered throughout the film. The movie ultimately becomes more complete and people will wish that the movie had shown the full 3 hours of footage in its theatrical debut. As a major DC comics fan, I will of course pick up on things that a comics fan would not, but someone who does not read comics would learn to appreciate this film in its entirety with the extended version. Get your hands on a copy today or find it on Netflix or the internet somewhere!"

"I ignored the bad reviews and watched anyways. This film had a lot to live up to after Civil War was released and I went into this film expecting the worst. It ended up to be the best Superhero film of 2016 to me. One complaint was that this film was more concerned about universe building than telling a great story than Civil War but for me it was the other way around; Civil War felt like a build up to something else and to be honest, I felt that way when I saw the other MCU films. Batman vs Superman however not only had a great story, but it also felt a lot more consistent than Civil War. This film was way more diverse with the cast than the MCU but unlike the MCU, I felt like this film doesn't go overboard with the SJW stuff like the MCU films or The Star Wars Sequel films do. The Visuals were AMAZING, The Score by Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL was AMAZING as well, The Tone is just right as I actually felt for the characters emotionally, The Cinematography kept my eyes glued to the screen, and the script felt really Intelligent and Complex and despite people calling the writing confusing, I was able to piece it together with no problem whatsoever. This film is similar to Empire Strikes back in terms of popularity so over time after the other movies are released, this movie would probably be more popular.This film was way better than I Expected and deserves another chance.

"Its shame to see what critics and marvel fans did to this movie and targeted Zack Snyder for it. I have seen this movie more than 25 times till date. And i enjoy this movie as much as i enjoyed the first time. The fans who have read DC comics, wouldn't be disappointed in this movie. Its dark movie, yes it is. Because the title shows the intense situation at hand. Two superheroes about to rip each other apart for whatever reasons that brought them to this stage. Yes it had to be dark and intense.Only marvel can be stupid enough to show an alien invasion where humans are loosing the battle and the super heroes are cracking jokes while battles as if they are playing ping pong. a person playing Call of Duty game is more serious while playing than the marvel heroes fighting aliens."

"Last week some news came out from somebody online who had claimed to have seen a finished version of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. If you were like me, you've been leery of checking it out because you weren't sure how much might actually be true. Now Zack Snyder has spoken out about the spoiler-filled post, although his response doesn't really clear anything up.In a word, to MTV, he called the post \"hilarious,which might imply that he's saying that it's mostly, if not entirely, untrue. That might be the case, but then again he could have just said it was untrue and he didn't say that. What he did say, however, is that he doesn't like spoilers. While this may seem odd for the director who's most recent trailer appeared to give away the entire movie, Snyder says that's not the case. Even if you've seen the trailer, you can rest easy, as there is much more we have not seen in then finished film. Says Snyder I have the benefit of seeing the movie. It's cool that think it's too much, and I appreciate people not wanting to know, but there's plenty that they don't know. There's a lot of movie that's not in the trailer. In the process of calling the Batman v Superman Reddit review hilarious, Snyder goes on to talk about how he hates it when spoilers come out. The director would much rather that fans see the movie mostly blind. While he understands that some fans may wish to find the answers before hand, he wants his movies to be mysteries going in. If you're, as an audience member, exploring these articles, looking for answers to questions that you have, maybe you're okay with knowing before you go. It's like an individual taste. But like I said, I want people to see the movie without knowing.Spoilers are a topic that mean different things to different people. While most try to avoid them to some degree, the need to solve the mystery is a nearly universal human experience. We have an inclination to want to know the truth, even while also wanting to be surprised. For most of us getting some information is good, but getting all the information is bad, of course, only getting the details that you want can be difficult."
"The theatrical is choppy, poorly edited, hard to follow, with some really good moments mixed in their. The extended is much more fluent and is much easier to follow, it does have a long runtime, which might make it seem a bit dragging on, but if you like long films done right, like Lord of the Rings, you will like this movie as long as you get into the characters and story. Speaking of which, the story starts out perfectly showing Bruce Wayne as a character, and it is very powerful. There are several moments in this movie that are powerful, emotional, and shocking. Characters. Batman is my favorite fictional character of all time, and believe me when I say, Ben Affleck as Batman was perfect, he had the charisma, the anger, and the look of being through some bad stuff Gal Gadot also does perfect as Wonder Woman, but if you want to really see how good she does, go watch the Wonder Woman movie. Henry Call as Superman. I really don't like it when people say Christopher Reeves is better. Don't get me wrong, Reeves does great, but can you imagine him as Superman in this movie? I wouldn't like it. It would be like Adam West playing Batman in The Dark Knight. Henry Cavill does great in this role, I can say everything about him as I said with Ben Affleck. Jesse Eisenberg as Luthor. I thought it was different in a good way. I've heard a criticism for him as being too much like Joker, but is that a bad thing? Joker is my favorite villain, so to see Superman have an enemy that crazy, but still hold the values Luthor needs to be Luthor, I think it is great. The thing I thought this movie was lacking in the first and second acts was humor, at least good humor. If there was more humor, I would've given this movie a ten because it would give a more relaxing feel to the parts that needed it. All in all though, this movie was awesome, it had powerful moments, it was badass, and just plain fun. It had a great story arc and does its job very well."

"*I will be talking about the Ultimate Edition of the film* This was one of the most anticipated CBM of all time. Ever since the arrival and subsequent success of Marvel's The Avengers people have wondered when will DC launch its own cinematic universe, one of the main reasons being the opportunity to finally see titans such as Batman and Superman share the screen together: the ultimate nerd dream. On 2016, the moment finally came for BvS to be released AND.. it performed poorly. Not only did critical reception left a lot to be desired, but fan reactions where surprisingly split after its cinematic debut. People either loved it and called Zack a genius, or hated it and called him a hack. Me, personally, I found myself with middle of the road feelings, for sure, but more leaning towards the negative side with subsequent viewings. The theatrical cut of the film showcased amazing performances, incredible visuals, and action set pieces that seemed like comic book panels come to life, in a good way. However, when it comes to its narrative structure and more technical aspects like editing, the film was seriously flawed. More plot holes than Age of Ultron, questionable character decisions, random editing that lacked cohesion and focus, and forced dramatic moments that lacked any impact because the attempts at character development ranged from limited to nonexistent, especially when it comes to Superman's character. I thought it was a 5/10 movie at best. As such, I was kind of skeptical about the idea of a 30 minute longer version. I say kind of because I know how Zack works. I remember Watchmen being vastly improved with its director's cut, so in a way I was expecting BvS to perform in a similar manner, but I also feared those 30 minutes wold be just there to amplify action and discredit storytelling issues. Oh boy, I'm so glad I was proved wrong. The ultimate cut of the film was infuriating, but not because it was awful, but because it questions the sanity of WB executives and editors and makes you wonder what were they thinking during the editing process. What I got out of the Ultimate Edition was a thought-provoking deconstruction of two very iconic superheroes that gave spotlight to the struggles both of them face when they aren't fighting crime. What I got was an extremely well produced character study on both Batman and Superman in a cynical world, a world dangerously close to our own. We meet Batman as a ruthless, worn out hero that has seen the failure behind his ideals and witnessed some truly horrifying things in his life. Superman, on the other hand, is portrayed as a godlike figure that seeks to do good in the world, but finds himself emotionally conflicted once he realized that every good deed he does leaves behind a trail of destruction (most of it due to Luthor's antics). In my opinion, this is a hugely original approach, one that distances itself from the rest of the competition and delivers a dark, somber, yet relevant superhero movie that understands both characters and gives them real human struggles to deal with. I felt invested in both of them, and hoped that by the end of the film both could find a way to redeem themselves. Their character arcs were very well established during the first two acts of the movie, and by the time we get to the titular climactic battle the emotion behind the jaw-dropping action is intensified. Lex Luthor as a villain was also given more time to develop with this new edition. One of the main criticisms with the original version was the fact that his plan relied too much on conveniences, and the character's mannerisms and mad-scientist attitude was annoying, and that goes without saying his motivations were unclear. Not only do we spend more time understanding his hate for any godlike figure and thus his hatred for Superman, but the added scenes allowed us to witness his entire plan come to fruition. It sells the cold, manipulative, calculating attributes of his comic counterpart. The acting is spot on. Every actor owns his/her role, from Cavill's Superman, to Ben Affleck as Batman, Eisenberg as Luthor, and Gadot as Wonder Woman, whose scenes are brief, but are more than enough to sell the strong and ferocious warrior that she is. Cinematography is stunning, and miles above that of Man of Steel's. And the soundtrack by Zimmer and Junkie XL? Perfect, just perfect. When it comes to flaws, the film still has some of those. The Martha moment, while serving as a pivotal character moment for Batman, felt off in execution, and its understandable that many people got mad at it. If your main complaint about BvS the first time around was its bleak tone and subject matter, this film is still not for you. I understand most were expecting to see the heroes being the most iconic versions of themselves, clashing in an elongated battle and evoking the same feelings The Avengers gave audiences back in 2012. In that sense, the film will remain divisive, but at least I have the comfort of saying that, at the very least, the film is competently made."

"This film was amazing. Ben Affleck was easily the best part of this movie, he brought his a-game as Batman. The chemistry between Affleck & Irons was outstanding. Gal Gadot did a great job as Wonder Woman. The fight between Batman & Superman was awesome. The final fight with Doomsday was outstanding in every way possible. However, there is only one problem with this film and that's Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor. He was sadly missed cast in this role, but then again it's really the fault of Warner Bros. Studios. Overall, this film deliver on almost every level. I highly recommend that you watch the extended version of this film."

"I know I know. I saw it in theaters too, and felt like it could've been so much better. While the Batman element was good, the narrative felt fractured, and the third act was just one long stunt scene. Superman was relegated to a supporting character, and other characters didn't get a chance to shine. And then I chanced on the ultimate cut. Calling it 30 mins of \"extra\" footage is unfair to Zack Snyder because it's exactly these 30 mins that makes the movie a worthy one. What I can say about the theatrical cut is this - It had the blockbuster elements - music, visuals, stunts, CGI. But, it lacked the human elements. The first 20 mins of the movie had it, but not after that. The extended cut in comparison has a flow to the narrative. There are no disjointed scenes, everything flows smoothly, and there's connective tissue. Superman gets to spend some time with his father, and mother. Clark Kent does some investigative journalism. Superman helps the people after the blast. Lois Lane doesn't jump to conclusions, she gets to the bottom of the crime. Lex Luthor apparently had a coherent plan - everything is explained pretty well. Wonder Woman was already good, so there's no change there :) Also, the \"Martha\" scene seems better executed, because it is a few seconds longer, and there's time to breathe it in. So, here's my take on this movie - The theatrical cut was junk. Get the Bluray for ultimate edition, and you shall not be disappointed. I've seen it so many more times now, and it's the definitive cut. It is the movie we deserve. It's a unique take on Batman, and Superman. It's a gritty take on the superhero movie genre, and definitely the best DCEU movie, and the best DC movie since The Dark Knight.P.S. Yes it's dark. We're adults, and we should appreciate mature film making without intentionally silly moments. It attempts to be philosophical, and something deep instead of just trying to make you chuckle."

"This is one of the best superhero movies ever made. Zack Snyder is a magician behind the camera.The reason behind so many complaints is the fact that Warner Bros. marketed this movie as a fight between Batman and Superman. That's not what it is. It's a movie about the origins of the Justice League.The cinematography, the acting and the score are all second to none. This film is phenomenal.P.S: watch the 3 hour extended cut that Snyder intended you to see, not the 2 and a half hour movie that Warner Bros. decided would be better for theaters."

"I don't care what the critics say, this is a very well-done movie. I'll start my review by listing what I like about the movie.1.) Ben Affleck is the best batman to me and it is not close. He pulls off the role of an aging batman extremely well. Also, Zack Snyder's vision of batman is legit. I have always hated batman up until this adaptation of him. Instead of being a conflicted and idealistic batman, this batman is dark, gritty, and 100% a badass. His equipment is decked out with machine guns and he has no aversion to killing people. In fact, he probably kills about 50 criminal by the time this movie is over. The warehouse scene is the coolest batman scene in any movie.2.) The development of a grudge between batman and superman is pulled off flawlessly. It actually makes sense why batman dislikes superman. Then, when they do fight it is about the coolest thing you can expect to see from a superhero film. 3.) I disagree with a lot of people about Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor. In my opinion, he played his role to perfection. 4.) B v S sets up Wonder Woman and Justice League with Gal Gadot's cameo as Wonder Woman and short clips of Aquaman, the Flash, and Cyborg. B v S is one of my favorite superhero films and rewatching it never gets old."

"The theatrical cut of this film is garbage which is why I rated it eight stars instead of nine. The first time I watched this film I didn't like it (not straight out hate but didn't like). Character motivations didn't make any sense, Lex was annoying as s***, editing was sloppy, and it was overly dark and broody for an action superhero movie. A year + a half, five Marvel films, a ton of bad reviews and a Justice League later a thought popped into my head: \"what if I watched BVS again\". This time I didn't have trailers ruining the best moments, I only vaguely remembered the film, and I was conditioned to look at it negatively but something unexpected happened: I actually loved it. Superman was just a normal person that tried to make a difference cause he could that others imposed their own beliefs on. Lex Luthor was a genius that couldn't stand his powerlessness compared to Superman or more accurately a super being. As Alfred said \"The fever, the rage, the feeling of powerlessness that turns good men... cruel\" and you see the same thought process in Batman. Batman, just like Lex Luthor feels powerless in the midst of a god-being and just like Lex he attempts to destroy him so he can get his sense of power back but unlike Lex, Batman learns something. I what is one of the corniest lines of the movie Superman says, \"Martha\" when he knows he can't win against Batman in a late desperate attempt to save his mother. Not only does this name connect with Bruce Wayne but it also shows what really matters to a man of steel: it isn't power, it isn't fame or anything else, it is his Mother and on a broader scale it is people. Lex (who doesn't care about people at all) knows he doesn't have the power so he creates something from his blood and the remains of Zod: A Doomsday for Superman. Not only does this film have depth but it also doesn't always explain it to you which is rare in a blockbuster action superhero flick normally cater to semi-comic book fans and people that want to shove popcorn in their mouths. This film rewards you for really noticing the details while still having massive explosions. One of my favorites is how Lex has all of Batman's branded killed which is why he isn't afraid of the branding at the end or Grandma's Peach Tea as a way of scaring the s*** out of someone. Of course, this film isn't perfect and I do have personal dislikes. The Batman V Superman fight was slow and pretty boring especially after watching such an amazing fight in Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 2 (If you haven't watched the animated Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 1 and 2 you are sorely missing out on something fantastic). Also, the addition of Wonder Woman who pretty much steals a hacker thing, gives it back and then suits up and fights against a giant monster thing. Not to say I don't like Wonder Woman (She is one of my favorite Superheroes of all time who showed not only can woman kick a** but they also don't need to be ashamed of their sexuality or gender) but she wasn't really that helpful to the plot and just brought in to expand the universe which was well done through Lex's superhuman hunting files. Also, the post-apocalyptic scene that was just a dream could have been cut but nothing is perfect except movies like Citizen Kane which isn't a lot of fun to watch cause it is too perfect. So to summarize, the theatrical cut is bad, the ultimate cut is Amazing and the other cut is meh. Please give it a second chance because it deserves it and save a good director from losing grace because of something he didn't do."
"I really liked it, don't know what all the hate is about. I'm actually a Marvel fan from when I was 7 or so, but Superman and Batman together in 1 movie? Just great. And personally I like Ben Affleck even better than Christian Bale as Batman. So just watch and enjoy, I know I did!"

"That's right. We have been waiting for these two heroes to finally meet and fight against each other. This movie is so good in both plot and special effects.Henry Cavill and Ben Affleck have performed well in their acting stages. They are the best superhero actors and they have filmed their fighting scenes very well. The movie starts to show the conflict between the lives of the heroes and now they have blamed each other for it. This movie is amazing and sets up a good plot for Dawn Justice."

"Actually...I didn't know what to expect. When you see Wonder Woman, you know it will be off of Wonder Woman and off of a Wonder Woman story, but with Batman V Superman, I was like, \"hmmmm, so who is this about?\" It was pretty obvious that it would feature many characters, but I thought the introduction to Batman was amazing. Ben Affleck nailed the part, not only as Batman but also as Bruce Wayne. He is my Batman. Henry Cavill continued to be super as the Man of Steel. And he is my Super - Man. A dark story? Yes, without a doubt. Could it have had a few more jokes? Sure. But not all movies or stories need to have jokes when certain events are serious. I really hope people can see this review and take another look at the movie, because, I loved it. I really hope the ratings can go up, eventually. And P.S, this movie is the perfect set up to Justice League."

"I'll start by making it clear I have only ever seen the Ultimate Edition. I'm aware of what was cut out for the theatrical release, so I will concede up front that most of the criticisms about pacing, editing, and missing bits of plot at release were merited.With that caveat out of the way, I must reiterate that this was bar-none the boldest superhero movie I have ever seen. To me, it was arguably the best as well, though \"best\" shouldn't be taken to mean \"most enjoyable.\" That honor easily goes to \"Thor: Ragnarok.\" What makes BvS stand out among other films in the genre is that it takes two characters who have been done to death since the 1970s and brings them up to date. I recently tried to watch \"Superman: The Movie\" for the first time in a number of years, and while it was still good and Reeves will always be iconic, I just couldn't take it seriously. I'll put it this way: If the story in BvS was \"stupid\" in your view but Superman turning back time by spinning the earth backward on its axis didn't seem like one of the dumbest things you have ever seen -in any movie from any genre- to the extent that it outright ruins the movie for you, then your opinion about BvS isn't worth much. Nostalgic bias was always going to be a problem for this movie, and the way people reacted to and reviewed \"Man of Steel\" was telling in this regard.That brings me to Zack Snyder's take on Superman. You know, that guy whose status as the first extraterrestrial ever encountered by humanity was a total non-issue in the old movies. Apparently, Snyder has a similar view to my own in that his take on the Man of Steel makes his being an alien a core piece of his identity. He may look like any other (absurdly attractive) person, but he knows what he is, and that makes him perpetually uncertain of where he fits in this world. He is essentially good and really does care about people, but he struggles to truly empathize with the likes of us. To be human is to be frail, and that is not something he can easily relate to. This is the root of his conflict with Batman.Just as Clark struggles to genuinely relate to most people, Snyder's Batman either refuses to or otherwise just can't relate to Superman. He doesn't see him as anything but a threat regardless of Superman's clear good intentions. Remember, a small group of Kryptonians were able to bring humanity to the brink of extinction in less than a day, and Bruce Wayne is nothing if not a realist. He didn't know the guy from Kansas. He only knew the god from another world.While Batman's anger toward and fear of Superman are readily apparent from the start, Superman's inability to imagine things from Bruce Wayne's perspective only becomes truly apparent during their first real interaction. This reminded me of the animated version of the \"world's finest\" storyline, where Superman judges Batman harshly for using fear tactics and threats of violence (also, actual violence) to get the job done. Superman wasn't willing to consider what it would take for a human man to fight criminals and save innocents, or what that life would do to him over time. Just as Batman didn't see the guy from Kansas, Superman didn't see the man who lives his life trapped in one brutal, unthinkably traumatic moment (this was beautifully conveyed during the film's opening moments), and had spent his whole adult life bearing witness to humanity at its absolute worst.The conflict between these two characters is as old as human history. They want the same things, but they can't understand one another. So they fight. And what a fight it was.Watching a fight between, say, Captain America and Iron Man was, to me, more frustrating than anything because each understood the other's perspective perfectly. The fight between Batman and Superman in BvS was genuinely gut-wrenching, as intended, because they would have understood one another if either had tried. The whole sequence hilighted Batman's tactical prowess and ability to control a situation. Maybe the most badass thing about the fight was that it ended exactly where Batman planned. That brings me to the big elephant in the room named \"Martha.\"I can't recall exactly which YouTuber put it this way, but if you thought the \"save Martha\" exchange was about their mothers having the same name, you had your brain turned off. The brain-on people have explained this to death, but it bears repeating. This was the moment when Superman became humanized to Batman. He was about to die, and his only concern was for his adoptive human mother. He still believed that the man about to take his life would do the right thing. Even with the cowl on, there was no mistaking the look on Batman's face. It was the look of shame, guilt, and sudden uncertainty that says \"What am I doing?\" Turns out even the most brutal, angry version of Bruce Wayne is better than Tony Stark at knowing right from wrong. At knowing that he had gone too far.From there, the third act was a series of truly impressive (albeit mostly CGI) fight sequences, beginning with what I regard as the undisputed champion of Batman fights. Nothing in the Nolan movies (and especially nothing in the Burton movies) even came close. Go ahead, try to convince yourself that Batman and Bane taking turns punching one another in the face until Bane's mask broke was a good fight sequence. No, this was a fight straight out of \"Arkham Knight,\" and it was glorious. The battle against Doomsday really was one for the books. From the moment Wonder Woman arrived accompanied by the intense sounds of Tina Guo's electric cello to Superman's tragic, heroic death at the hands of Doomsday, I was glued to the screen. Sure, the mere presence of Doomsday spoiled the end to a degree, but watching the Man of Steel laboring to carry that kryptonite spear towards certain death was no less impactful. A brief word on Jesse Eisenberg's take on Lex Luthor. At least one other reviewer on this site already said it best when they pointed out that this was his origin story. If you consider his scheme objectively, he is actually one of the more formidable incarnations of the character. If we're lucky, we'll eventually get to see a Snyder Cut of \"Justice League\" and find out where this story was actually meant to go. For the record, Joss Whedon and Danny Elfman both should have said \"no\" to taking a dump on someone else's art."
"BATMAN V SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE brings a fantastic surprise to a smash-hit team-up with one of the worlds most beloved DC Comics' icons of all time. The movie delivers spectacular casting, and fantastic acting with different characters having their shine in each scenes.The story follows Clark Kent/Superman who becomes a threat, after the destruction in Metropolis in Man Of Steel.(2013). Batman/Bruce Wayne sees him as a threat and begins his war on Superman.The movie brings spectacular storytelling, it tells the complications of human against alien who are on the same side, and the first meeting of Batman and Superman. The story of Bruce Wayne, with his many years of The Caped Crusader, sends him on a spiral of \"out of control\", sheer anger, and builds tension to wanting to defeat the Man of Steel. Snyder has fantastically gave this storytelling an exciting nod to the comics.Lex Luthor, played by Jesse Einsberg, delivers a very interesting performance, but very differently by him showing is his \"origin\" before he becomes a bald foe to the Man of Steel. He shows that his love of \"god vs man\" terrorises mankind when he ultimately creates Doomsday, and Batman realises Superman's inner heroism.It packs so many great \"out of nowhere\" excitement, including a first-look of the fearful Wonder Woman a.k.a. Diana Prince, played by Gal Gadot, and a fresh-new glimpse of the superhero DC canon: The Justice League.WATCH THIS MOVIE! The critics are out of their mind. It's a fun-packed action adventure which still keeps the movie enjoyable until it's final minutes of the movie. It's a FANTASTIC MOVIE! BEN AFFLECK AS BATMAN... is Incredible!A 10/10 overall!"
"I want to go on record as saying that this is a truly thrilling cinematic experience in so many ways. If pressed, I guess I could acknowledge that there were a couple ... let's say \"clumsy\" moments. And in a film that runs to three hours, that hardly seems like a significant issue, certainly not enough to rate it with fewer than 9 stars.This film has everything. There is dramatic tension right from the start. There is a magnificent story arc that picks up quite seamlessly from 'Man of Steel' and propels the viewer not only into the life of Clark Kent/Superman but also of Bruce Wayne/Batman.The villain is no mere cartoon of a villain; he is truly thoroughly (and apparently irrevocably) diabolical. He is a psychopath, and you wish for his death over and over and over. You want Superman to reduce him to ash with the power of his eyes.I have read a number of viewers' reviews, and it seems that the people who disliked the film / gave it a low rating had rather unfair and unrealistic expectations of it. That is, their own prejudices about how the plot could/should unfold or what the character development could/should be, etc. ruined the film for them. And that is a shame.My thought is: I settle into my seat, wait for the lights to dim, and then I wait to be transported by the film. I accept it, lock, stock, and barrel.As another reviewer remarked, I love how the film begins from the point of view of Bruce Wayne as he is among people on the ground who have fallen victim to the attack of Zod and the other Kryptonians.Why would Bruce Wayne not like Superman? Why would the good people of Earth hurl insults at Superman and burn him in effigy (on the news)? Because the good people of Earth just got catapulted into a new reality in which there are not only extraterrestrial beings (surprise!) but they are also superman! And a group of them are hell-bent on destroying humankind and taking the planet for themselves.It is difficult to see Superman as separate from the whole Kryptonian Krew.It seems that many moviegoers forgot that Bruce Wayne is also human. Sure, he's a hero, but he is flawed.. Just like the rest of us. He is a vigilante, after all.He has let his vigilantism get the better of him. HE is actually the one working outside the boundaries of the law, not Superman. It is the clear head of Alfred that shows us that he has gone into a rather dark place, that he has not seen what is really going on (in Luthor's scheme), and so he chooses to embark on his own scheme scheme to take out the alien invader. He is (allegedly) thinking of the future: if he wipes out the all-powerful alien, then it can't turn on humankind in the future. At least, he convinces himself of that.A philosophical question is raised in the film: should Clark Kent have remained a simple man from Kansas and never have become the Superman? Should he just let people die and let calamities happen? The question is answered for us in the character of Diana Prince/Wonder Woman. She withdrew from mankind (her exact words) and just sat around watching. Watching while people died horrible deaths all around her. So, should Superman have done the same? Do these special beings, these 'metahumans', have some kind of moral imperative to intervene, or should they be allowed to be regular people, too? It seems that humans want it both ways.It seems that humans are saying: \"Don't be a superalien ... except when I and my friends and family are in trouble. Then come save us.\""

"Batman v Superman: Ultimate Edition: If your looking for a quick, cheap thrill then you might not enjoy this film at the time. This movies theatrical version was butchered by WB and in doing so reshaped the story leaving numerous plot holes. So the Ultimate Edition is the full story and the one worth seeing. Watch 'Man of Steel' before seeing this movie. There is much to claw through here, so much so that the audience might easily find themselves exhausted from the overall aggression of the film. However, a lot of the story does work. The action is good, and the emotion feels real most of the time.This film is about Superman trying to become Superman. Trying to help the world, save people, find a place in this world not as an outcast, and yet is looked at has a threat by many. Superman is not from this world, yet He is trying to be human, find a place in this world, be excepted by earths people, and come into his destiny.This film is also about Batman being Batman for 20 years and losing faith in humanity, and fearing Superman, what Superman can do with his powers. Great film, great plot, great visuals. ---Yidioo"
"I didn't see the film in the theaters and just bought the \"Extended Edition \" on Amazon. I never properly saw Man of Steel- i think I rented it and watched it when already exhausted and fell asleep. I saw the mediocre user reviews and horrible reviews from critics of this film.They really have it wrong. This is the very best either Batman or Superman. It has a different take, on things. Much darker then earlier films even darker then the Christopher Nolan Batman films.First of all Christopher Nolan is an Executive Producer. So how bad could it be? I loved Sucker Punch and Zack Snyder was involved with that. So how bad could this be? Hans Zimmer did the music, so how bad could it be?I remember watching the old Superman TV shows and reading the Superman and Batman comics as a little kid and loved them, but i wouldn't call myself a \"fan boy\" of comic universes, like so many younger people today. As an older adult I will admit my favorite TV show of all time was Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but watched it on DVD only after it had finished. I saw the second of the Dark Knight series in the theater, but the other two, I watched on DVD. They were great, but not my favorite films like so many people. i also loved the first couple Superman and Batman films in the older series. Regardless, i was not waiting with baited breath to see Man of Steel or this one.I'm more of a serious film fan, who can watch Stanley Kubrick films over and over and my favorite films in the last twenty years, are Eyes Wide Shut and Intersteller, both of which i've watched multiple times.So, with that said, take it from me, the critics have this film very wrong, just as critics hated 2001: A Space Odyssey when it first came out. This film will have lasting appreciation.Surprised how much I liked Ben Afleck's Batman. it was hard to get into Henry Cavil's scrawnier looking Superman, but it grew on me. Amy Adams was great as Lois Lane, The Gal Gadol Wonder Women was amazing. Lex Luther was terrific, like Nolan's Joker. Jeremy Irons was the best Alfred ever. Holly Hunter and Diane Lane was good too. The movie had bad reviews but made a billion dollars. Hopefully everyone buys the Ultimate Edition and it breaks sales records and the film is re-appreciated. I have no idea what scenes this Ultimate Edition added, but it is pretty perfect. Now I can't wait for Wonder Woman and the Justice League and as soon as I finish writing this am going to watch Man of Steal. I'm into it now!I can only surmise that the bad reviews stem from too much expectations of the rigid fan boy types and the radical changes in tone, we see in this film.Total masterpiece of cinema, but I have a few criticisms. There are a few hollow scenes of typical Idiot cops and authorities getting everything wrong in a cliché type way and it has a few filler scenes of that type and a few moments here and there that felt rushed and cheesy. Maybe not everything restored into the Ultimate Edition should have been. I wish there had been more Kevin Costner scenes."

"The whole entire Batman V Superman movie was great and yes even though it felt slow to the majority of the people who watched it but to me I enjoyed every part and every scene of Batman V Superman and when it got to the fight scenes both batman VS Superman and the Doomsday fight it brought so much drama, intensity, and epic performances. So with that being said I give this movie a good 10/10 because it really did go to my expectations and it brought a powerful performance and a powerful yet epic introduction to the upcoming Justice League."

"When I first wrote a review for this movie a year ago exclaiming my excitement for the film, I had been high off a fresh dose of live-action DC superheroes playing out the beloved comic book stories that I had grown up on. It was all playing out before my eyes and coming to life. After a few months had passed, I began to notice things about the movie that I disliked: little gaps in the story, things that didn't add up, etc. My original rating of a 10 / 10 dropped to an 8 /10. But today it has gone back up to a 10. The extended version of the film not only rectifies the gaps but also silences critics.Many claimed that the movie was too dark or that it just didn't make sense. To those people, I say: \"Pick up a comic book!\" Many of the critics of this particular film were part of the superhero bandwagon that formed when Marvel began its spree of Avengers-related films. In fact, its estimated that over 60% of people who go to see 'superhero' genre films have never picked up a comic book in their life. I would argue that similar numbers could figure to those which view the CW televised DC Universe shows. People complain that DC comics is just too dark but the fact is that these movies are based upon actual comics which are meant to be dark (ex: The Dark Knight Returns, Injustice, etc.). Its like complaining that Game of Thrones (the TV series) sucks because they kill off too many characters. Read the books! Its frustrating to see such a beautiful work of art like Batman V Superman criticized by those ignorant to its universe and its meaning. This movie is in fact a catalyst that opens numerous doorways and leaves true fans in awe of the possibilities for future movies. But regardless of whether or not people choose to educate themselves, this film's DVD/Blu-ray extended version puts the theater release to shame. All of the plot holes and gaps are filled in 30 minutes of extended footage scattered throughout the film. The movie ultimately becomes more complete and people will wish that the movie had shown the full 3 hours of footage in its theatrical debut. As a major DC comics fan, I will of course pick up on things that a comics fan would not, but someone who does not read comics would learn to appreciate this film in its entirety with the extended version. Get your hands on a copy today or find it on Netflix or the internet somewhere!"

"I ignored the bad reviews and watched anyways. This film had a lot to live up to after Civil War was released and I went into this film expecting the worst. It ended up to be the best Superhero film of 2016 to me. One complaint was that this film was more concerned about universe building than telling a great story than Civil War but for me it was the other way around; Civil War felt like a build up to something else and to be honest, I felt that way when I saw the other MCU films. Batman vs Superman however not only had a great story, but it also felt a lot more consistent than Civil War. This film was way more diverse with the cast than the MCU but unlike the MCU, I felt like this film doesn't go overboard with the SJW stuff like the MCU films or The Star Wars Sequel films do. The Visuals were AMAZING, The Score by Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL was AMAZING as well, The Tone is just right as I actually felt for the characters emotionally, The Cinematography kept my eyes glued to the screen, and the script felt really Intelligent and Complex and despite people calling the writing confusing, I was able to piece it together with no problem whatsoever. This film is similar to Empire Strikes back in terms of popularity so over time after the other movies are released, this movie would probably be more popular.This film was way better than I Expected and deserves another chance.

"Its shame to see what critics and marvel fans did to this movie and targeted Zack Snyder for it. I have seen this movie more than 25 times till date. And i enjoy this movie as much as i enjoyed the first time. The fans who have read DC comics, wouldn't be disappointed in this movie. Its dark movie, yes it is. Because the title shows the intense situation at hand. Two superheroes about to rip each other apart for whatever reasons that brought them to this stage. Yes it had to be dark and intense.Only marvel can be stupid enough to show an alien invasion where humans are loosing the battle and the super heroes are cracking jokes while battles as if they are playing ping pong. a person playing Call of Duty game is more serious while playing than the marvel heroes fighting aliens."

"Last week some news came out from somebody online who had claimed to have seen a finished version of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. If you were like me, you've been leery of checking it out because you weren't sure how much might actually be true. Now Zack Snyder has spoken out about the spoiler-filled post, although his response doesn't really clear anything up.In a word, to MTV, he called the post \"hilarious,which might imply that he's saying that it's mostly, if not entirely, untrue. That might be the case, but then again he could have just said it was untrue and he didn't say that. What he did say, however, is that he doesn't like spoilers. While this may seem odd for the director who's most recent trailer appeared to give away the entire movie, Snyder says that's not the case. Even if you've seen the trailer, you can rest easy, as there is much more we have not seen in then finished film. Says Snyder I have the benefit of seeing the movie. It's cool that think it's too much, and I appreciate people not wanting to know, but there's plenty that they don't know. There's a lot of movie that's not in the trailer. In the process of calling the Batman v Superman Reddit review hilarious, Snyder goes on to talk about how he hates it when spoilers come out. The director would much rather that fans see the movie mostly blind. While he understands that some fans may wish to find the answers before hand, he wants his movies to be mysteries going in. If you're, as an audience member, exploring these articles, looking for answers to questions that you have, maybe you're okay with knowing before you go. It's like an individual taste. But like I said, I want people to see the movie without knowing.Spoilers are a topic that mean different things to different people. While most try to avoid them to some degree, the need to solve the mystery is a nearly universal human experience. We have an inclination to want to know the truth, even while also wanting to be surprised. For most of us getting some information is good, but getting all the information is bad, of course, only getting the details that you want can be difficult."
"The theatrical is choppy, poorly edited, hard to follow, with some really good moments mixed in their. The extended is much more fluent and is much easier to follow, it does have a long runtime, which might make it seem a bit dragging on, but if you like long films done right, like Lord of the Rings, you will like this movie as long as you get into the characters and story. Speaking of which, the story starts out perfectly showing Bruce Wayne as a character, and it is very powerful. There are several moments in this movie that are powerful, emotional, and shocking. Characters. Batman is my favorite fictional character of all time, and believe me when I say, Ben Affleck as Batman was perfect, he had the charisma, the anger, and the look of being through some bad stuff Gal Gadot also does perfect as Wonder Woman, but if you want to really see how good she does, go watch the Wonder Woman movie. Henry Call as Superman. I really don't like it when people say Christopher Reeves is better. Don't get me wrong, Reeves does great, but can you imagine him as Superman in this movie? I wouldn't like it. It would be like Adam West playing Batman in The Dark Knight. Henry Cavill does great in this role, I can say everything about him as I said with Ben Affleck. Jesse Eisenberg as Luthor. I thought it was different in a good way. I've heard a criticism for him as being too much like Joker, but is that a bad thing? Joker is my favorite villain, so to see Superman have an enemy that crazy, but still hold the values Luthor needs to be Luthor, I think it is great. The thing I thought this movie was lacking in the first and second acts was humor, at least good humor. If there was more humor, I would've given this movie a ten because it would give a more relaxing feel to the parts that needed it. All in all though, this movie was awesome, it had powerful moments, it was badass, and just plain fun. It had a great story arc and does its job very well."

"*I will be talking about the Ultimate Edition of the film* This was one of the most anticipated CBM of all time. Ever since the arrival and subsequent success of Marvel's The Avengers people have wondered when will DC launch its own cinematic universe, one of the main reasons being the opportunity to finally see titans such as Batman and Superman share the screen together: the ultimate nerd dream. On 2016, the moment finally came for BvS to be released AND.. it performed poorly. Not only did critical reception left a lot to be desired, but fan reactions where surprisingly split after its cinematic debut. People either loved it and called Zack a genius, or hated it and called him a hack. Me, personally, I found myself with middle of the road feelings, for sure, but more leaning towards the negative side with subsequent viewings. The theatrical cut of the film showcased amazing performances, incredible visuals, and action set pieces that seemed like comic book panels come to life, in a good way. However, when it comes to its narrative structure and more technical aspects like editing, the film was seriously flawed. More plot holes than Age of Ultron, questionable character decisions, random editing that lacked cohesion and focus, and forced dramatic moments that lacked any impact because the attempts at character development ranged from limited to nonexistent, especially when it comes to Superman's character. I thought it was a 5/10 movie at best. As such, I was kind of skeptical about the idea of a 30 minute longer version. I say kind of because I know how Zack works. I remember Watchmen being vastly improved with its director's cut, so in a way I was expecting BvS to perform in a similar manner, but I also feared those 30 minutes wold be just there to amplify action and discredit storytelling issues. Oh boy, I'm so glad I was proved wrong. The ultimate cut of the film was infuriating, but not because it was awful, but because it questions the sanity of WB executives and editors and makes you wonder what were they thinking during the editing process. What I got out of the Ultimate Edition was a thought-provoking deconstruction of two very iconic superheroes that gave spotlight to the struggles both of them face when they aren't fighting crime. What I got was an extremely well produced character study on both Batman and Superman in a cynical world, a world dangerously close to our own. We meet Batman as a ruthless, worn out hero that has seen the failure behind his ideals and witnessed some truly horrifying things in his life. Superman, on the other hand, is portrayed as a godlike figure that seeks to do good in the world, but finds himself emotionally conflicted once he realized that every good deed he does leaves behind a trail of destruction (most of it due to Luthor's antics). In my opinion, this is a hugely original approach, one that distances itself from the rest of the competition and delivers a dark, somber, yet relevant superhero movie that understands both characters and gives them real human struggles to deal with. I felt invested in both of them, and hoped that by the end of the film both could find a way to redeem themselves. Their character arcs were very well established during the first two acts of the movie, and by the time we get to the titular climactic battle the emotion behind the jaw-dropping action is intensified. Lex Luthor as a villain was also given more time to develop with this new edition. One of the main criticisms with the original version was the fact that his plan relied too much on conveniences, and the character's mannerisms and mad-scientist attitude was annoying, and that goes without saying his motivations were unclear. Not only do we spend more time understanding his hate for any godlike figure and thus his hatred for Superman, but the added scenes allowed us to witness his entire plan come to fruition. It sells the cold, manipulative, calculating attributes of his comic counterpart. The acting is spot on. Every actor owns his/her role, from Cavill's Superman, to Ben Affleck as Batman, Eisenberg as Luthor, and Gadot as Wonder Woman, whose scenes are brief, but are more than enough to sell the strong and ferocious warrior that she is. Cinematography is stunning, and miles above that of Man of Steel's. And the soundtrack by Zimmer and Junkie XL? Perfect, just perfect. When it comes to flaws, the film still has some of those. The Martha moment, while serving as a pivotal character moment for Batman, felt off in execution, and its understandable that many people got mad at it. If your main complaint about BvS the first time around was its bleak tone and subject matter, this film is still not for you. I understand most were expecting to see the heroes being the most iconic versions of themselves, clashing in an elongated battle and evoking the same feelings The Avengers gave audiences back in 2012. In that sense, the film will remain divisive, but at least I have the comfort of saying that, at the very least, the film is competently made."

"This film was amazing. Ben Affleck was easily the best part of this movie, he brought his a-game as Batman. The chemistry between Affleck & Irons was outstanding. Gal Gadot did a great job as Wonder Woman. The fight between Batman & Superman was awesome. The final fight with Doomsday was outstanding in every way possible. However, there is only one problem with this film and that's Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor. He was sadly missed cast in this role, but then again it's really the fault of Warner Bros. Studios. Overall, this film deliver on almost every level. I highly recommend that you watch the extended version of this film."

"I know I know. I saw it in theaters too, and felt like it could've been so much better. While the Batman element was good, the narrative felt fractured, and the third act was just one long stunt scene. Superman was relegated to a supporting character, and other characters didn't get a chance to shine. And then I chanced on the ultimate cut. Calling it 30 mins of \"extra\" footage is unfair to Zack Snyder because it's exactly these 30 mins that makes the movie a worthy one. What I can say about the theatrical cut is this - It had the blockbuster elements - music, visuals, stunts, CGI. But, it lacked the human elements. The first 20 mins of the movie had it, but not after that. The extended cut in comparison has a flow to the narrative. There are no disjointed scenes, everything flows smoothly, and there's connective tissue. Superman gets to spend some time with his father, and mother. Clark Kent does some investigative journalism. Superman helps the people after the blast. Lois Lane doesn't jump to conclusions, she gets to the bottom of the crime. Lex Luthor apparently had a coherent plan - everything is explained pretty well. Wonder Woman was already good, so there's no change there :) Also, the \"Martha\" scene seems better executed, because it is a few seconds longer, and there's time to breathe it in. So, here's my take on this movie - The theatrical cut was junk. Get the Bluray for ultimate edition, and you shall not be disappointed. I've seen it so many more times now, and it's the definitive cut. It is the movie we deserve. It's a unique take on Batman, and Superman. It's a gritty take on the superhero movie genre, and definitely the best DCEU movie, and the best DC movie since The Dark Knight.P.S. Yes it's dark. We're adults, and we should appreciate mature film making without intentionally silly moments. It attempts to be philosophical, and something deep instead of just trying to make you chuckle."

"This is one of the best superhero movies ever made. Zack Snyder is a magician behind the camera.The reason behind so many complaints is the fact that Warner Bros. marketed this movie as a fight between Batman and Superman. That's not what it is. It's a movie about the origins of the Justice League.The cinematography, the acting and the score are all second to none. This film is phenomenal.P.S: watch the 3 hour extended cut that Snyder intended you to see, not the 2 and a half hour movie that Warner Bros. decided would be better for theaters."

"I don't care what the critics say, this is a very well-done movie. I'll start my review by listing what I like about the movie.1.) Ben Affleck is the best batman to me and it is not close. He pulls off the role of an aging batman extremely well. Also, Zack Snyder's vision of batman is legit. I have always hated batman up until this adaptation of him. Instead of being a conflicted and idealistic batman, this batman is dark, gritty, and 100% a badass. His equipment is decked out with machine guns and he has no aversion to killing people. In fact, he probably kills about 50 criminal by the time this movie is over. The warehouse scene is the coolest batman scene in any movie.2.) The development of a grudge between batman and superman is pulled off flawlessly. It actually makes sense why batman dislikes superman. Then, when they do fight it is about the coolest thing you can expect to see from a superhero film. 3.) I disagree with a lot of people about Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor. In my opinion, he played his role to perfection. 4.) B v S sets up Wonder Woman and Justice League with Gal Gadot's cameo as Wonder Woman and short clips of Aquaman, the Flash, and Cyborg. B v S is one of my favorite superhero films and rewatching it never gets old."

"The theatrical cut of this film is garbage which is why I rated it eight stars instead of nine. The first time I watched this film I didn't like it (not straight out hate but didn't like). Character motivations didn't make any sense, Lex was annoying as s***, editing was sloppy, and it was overly dark and broody for an action superhero movie. A year + a half, five Marvel films, a ton of bad reviews and a Justice League later a thought popped into my head: \"what if I watched BVS again\". This time I didn't have trailers ruining the best moments, I only vaguely remembered the film, and I was conditioned to look at it negatively but something unexpected happened: I actually loved it. Superman was just a normal person that tried to make a difference cause he could that others imposed their own beliefs on. Lex Luthor was a genius that couldn't stand his powerlessness compared to Superman or more accurately a super being. As Alfred said \"The fever, the rage, the feeling of powerlessness that turns good men... cruel\" and you see the same thought process in Batman. Batman, just like Lex Luthor feels powerless in the midst of a god-being and just like Lex he attempts to destroy him so he can get his sense of power back but unlike Lex, Batman learns something. I what is one of the corniest lines of the movie Superman says, \"Martha\" when he knows he can't win against Batman in a late desperate attempt to save his mother. Not only does this name connect with Bruce Wayne but it also shows what really matters to a man of steel: it isn't power, it isn't fame or anything else, it is his Mother and on a broader scale it is people. Lex (who doesn't care about people at all) knows he doesn't have the power so he creates something from his blood and the remains of Zod: A Doomsday for Superman. Not only does this film have depth but it also doesn't always explain it to you which is rare in a blockbuster action superhero flick normally cater to semi-comic book fans and people that want to shove popcorn in their mouths. This film rewards you for really noticing the details while still having massive explosions. One of my favorites is how Lex has all of Batman's branded killed which is why he isn't afraid of the branding at the end or Grandma's Peach Tea as a way of scaring the s*** out of someone. Of course, this film isn't perfect and I do have personal dislikes. The Batman V Superman fight was slow and pretty boring especially after watching such an amazing fight in Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 2 (If you haven't watched the animated Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 1 and 2 you are sorely missing out on something fantastic). Also, the addition of Wonder Woman who pretty much steals a hacker thing, gives it back and then suits up and fights against a giant monster thing. Not to say I don't like Wonder Woman (She is one of my favorite Superheroes of all time who showed not only can woman kick a** but they also don't need to be ashamed of their sexuality or gender) but she wasn't really that helpful to the plot and just brought in to expand the universe which was well done through Lex's superhuman hunting files. Also, the post-apocalyptic scene that was just a dream could have been cut but nothing is perfect except movies like Citizen Kane which isn't a lot of fun to watch cause it is too perfect. So to summarize, the theatrical cut is bad, the ultimate cut is Amazing and the other cut is meh. Please give it a second chance because it deserves it and save a good director from losing grace because of something he didn't do."
"I really liked it, don't know what all the hate is about. I'm actually a Marvel fan from when I was 7 or so, but Superman and Batman together in 1 movie? Just great. And personally I like Ben Affleck even better than Christian Bale as Batman. So just watch and enjoy, I know I did!"

"That's right. We have been waiting for these two heroes to finally meet and fight against each other. This movie is so good in both plot and special effects.Henry Cavill and Ben Affleck have performed well in their acting stages. They are the best superhero actors and they have filmed their fighting scenes very well. The movie starts to show the conflict between the lives of the heroes and now they have blamed each other for it. This movie is amazing and sets up a good plot for Dawn Justice."

"Actually...I didn't know what to expect. When you see Wonder Woman, you know it will be off of Wonder Woman and off of a Wonder Woman story, but with Batman V Superman, I was like, \"hmmmm, so who is this about?\" It was pretty obvious that it would feature many characters, but I thought the introduction to Batman was amazing. Ben Affleck nailed the part, not only as Batman but also as Bruce Wayne. He is my Batman. Henry Cavill continued to be super as the Man of Steel. And he is my Super - Man. A dark story? Yes, without a doubt. Could it have had a few more jokes? Sure. But not all movies or stories need to have jokes when certain events are serious. I really hope people can see this review and take another look at the movie, because, I loved it. I really hope the ratings can go up, eventually. And P.S, this movie is the perfect set up to Justice League."

"I'll start by making it clear I have only ever seen the Ultimate Edition. I'm aware of what was cut out for the theatrical release, so I will concede up front that most of the criticisms about pacing, editing, and missing bits of plot at release were merited.With that caveat out of the way, I must reiterate that this was bar-none the boldest superhero movie I have ever seen. To me, it was arguably the best as well, though \"best\" shouldn't be taken to mean \"most enjoyable.\" That honor easily goes to \"Thor: Ragnarok.\" What makes BvS stand out among other films in the genre is that it takes two characters who have been done to death since the 1970s and brings them up to date. I recently tried to watch \"Superman: The Movie\" for the first time in a number of years, and while it was still good and Reeves will always be iconic, I just couldn't take it seriously. I'll put it this way: If the story in BvS was \"stupid\" in your view but Superman turning back time by spinning the earth backward on its axis didn't seem like one of the dumbest things you have ever seen -in any movie from any genre- to the extent that it outright ruins the movie for you, then your opinion about BvS isn't worth much. Nostalgic bias was always going to be a problem for this movie, and the way people reacted to and reviewed \"Man of Steel\" was telling in this regard.That brings me to Zack Snyder's take on Superman. You know, that guy whose status as the first extraterrestrial ever encountered by humanity was a total non-issue in the old movies. Apparently, Snyder has a similar view to my own in that his take on the Man of Steel makes his being an alien a core piece of his identity. He may look like any other (absurdly attractive) person, but he knows what he is, and that makes him perpetually uncertain of where he fits in this world. He is essentially good and really does care about people, but he struggles to truly empathize with the likes of us. To be human is to be frail, and that is not something he can easily relate to. This is the root of his conflict with Batman.Just as Clark struggles to genuinely relate to most people, Snyder's Batman either refuses to or otherwise just can't relate to Superman. He doesn't see him as anything but a threat regardless of Superman's clear good intentions. Remember, a small group of Kryptonians were able to bring humanity to the brink of extinction in less than a day, and Bruce Wayne is nothing if not a realist. He didn't know the guy from Kansas. He only knew the god from another world.While Batman's anger toward and fear of Superman are readily apparent from the start, Superman's inability to imagine things from Bruce Wayne's perspective only becomes truly apparent during their first real interaction. This reminded me of the animated version of the \"world's finest\" storyline, where Superman judges Batman harshly for using fear tactics and threats of violence (also, actual violence) to get the job done. Superman wasn't willing to consider what it would take for a human man to fight criminals and save innocents, or what that life would do to him over time. Just as Batman didn't see the guy from Kansas, Superman didn't see the man who lives his life trapped in one brutal, unthinkably traumatic moment (this was beautifully conveyed during the film's opening moments), and had spent his whole adult life bearing witness to humanity at its absolute worst.The conflict between these two characters is as old as human history. They want the same things, but they can't understand one another. So they fight. And what a fight it was.Watching a fight between, say, Captain America and Iron Man was, to me, more frustrating than anything because each understood the other's perspective perfectly. The fight between Batman and Superman in BvS was genuinely gut-wrenching, as intended, because they would have understood one another if either had tried. The whole sequence hilighted Batman's tactical prowess and ability to control a situation. Maybe the most badass thing about the fight was that it ended exactly where Batman planned. That brings me to the big elephant in the room named \"Martha.\"I can't recall exactly which YouTuber put it this way, but if you thought the \"save Martha\" exchange was about their mothers having the same name, you had your brain turned off. The brain-on people have explained this to death, but it bears repeating. This was the moment when Superman became humanized to Batman. He was about to die, and his only concern was for his adoptive human mother. He still believed that the man about to take his life would do the right thing. Even with the cowl on, there was no mistaking the look on Batman's face. It was the look of shame, guilt, and sudden uncertainty that says \"What am I doing?\" Turns out even the most brutal, angry version of Bruce Wayne is better than Tony Stark at knowing right from wrong. At knowing that he had gone too far.From there, the third act was a series of truly impressive (albeit mostly CGI) fight sequences, beginning with what I regard as the undisputed champion of Batman fights. Nothing in the Nolan movies (and especially nothing in the Burton movies) even came close. Go ahead, try to convince yourself that Batman and Bane taking turns punching one another in the face until Bane's mask broke was a good fight sequence. No, this was a fight straight out of \"Arkham Knight,\" and it was glorious. The battle against Doomsday really was one for the books. From the moment Wonder Woman arrived accompanied by the intense sounds of Tina Guo's electric cello to Superman's tragic, heroic death at the hands of Doomsday, I was glued to the screen. Sure, the mere presence of Doomsday spoiled the end to a degree, but watching the Man of Steel laboring to carry that kryptonite spear towards certain death was no less impactful. A brief word on Jesse Eisenberg's take on Lex Luthor. At least one other reviewer on this site already said it best when they pointed out that this was his origin story. If you consider his scheme objectively, he is actually one of the more formidable incarnations of the character. If we're lucky, we'll eventually get to see a Snyder Cut of \"Justice League\" and find out where this story was actually meant to go. For the record, Joss Whedon and Danny Elfman both should have said \"no\" to taking a dump on someone else's art."
"BATMAN V SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE brings a fantastic surprise to a smash-hit team-up with one of the worlds most beloved DC Comics' icons of all time. The movie delivers spectacular casting, and fantastic acting with different characters having their shine in each scenes.The story follows Clark Kent/Superman who becomes a threat, after the destruction in Metropolis in Man Of Steel.(2013). Batman/Bruce Wayne sees him as a threat and begins his war on Superman.The movie brings spectacular storytelling, it tells the complications of human against alien who are on the same side, and the first meeting of Batman and Superman. The story of Bruce Wayne, with his many years of The Caped Crusader, sends him on a spiral of \"out of control\", sheer anger, and builds tension to wanting to defeat the Man of Steel. Snyder has fantastically gave this storytelling an exciting nod to the comics.Lex Luthor, played by Jesse Einsberg, delivers a very interesting performance, but very differently by him showing is his \"origin\" before he becomes a bald foe to the Man of Steel. He shows that his love of \"god vs man\" terrorises mankind when he ultimately creates Doomsday, and Batman realises Superman's inner heroism.It packs so many great \"out of nowhere\" excitement, including a first-look of the fearful Wonder Woman a.k.a. Diana Prince, played by Gal Gadot, and a fresh-new glimpse of the superhero DC canon: The Justice League.WATCH THIS MOVIE! The critics are out of their mind. It's a fun-packed action adventure which still keeps the movie enjoyable until it's final minutes of the movie. It's a FANTASTIC MOVIE! BEN AFFLECK AS BATMAN... is Incredible!A 10/10 overall!"
"I want to go on record as saying that this is a truly thrilling cinematic experience in so many ways. If pressed, I guess I could acknowledge that there were a couple ... let's say \"clumsy\" moments. And in a film that runs to three hours, that hardly seems like a significant issue, certainly not enough to rate it with fewer than 9 stars.This film has everything. There is dramatic tension right from the start. There is a magnificent story arc that picks up quite seamlessly from 'Man of Steel' and propels the viewer not only into the life of Clark Kent/Superman but also of Bruce Wayne/Batman.The villain is no mere cartoon of a villain; he is truly thoroughly (and apparently irrevocably) diabolical. He is a psychopath, and you wish for his death over and over and over. You want Superman to reduce him to ash with the power of his eyes.I have read a number of viewers' reviews, and it seems that the people who disliked the film / gave it a low rating had rather unfair and unrealistic expectations of it. That is, their own prejudices about how the plot could/should unfold or what the character development could/should be, etc. ruined the film for them. And that is a shame.My thought is: I settle into my seat, wait for the lights to dim, and then I wait to be transported by the film. I accept it, lock, stock, and barrel.As another reviewer remarked, I love how the film begins from the point of view of Bruce Wayne as he is among people on the ground who have fallen victim to the attack of Zod and the other Kryptonians.Why would Bruce Wayne not like Superman? Why would the good people of Earth hurl insults at Superman and burn him in effigy (on the news)? Because the good people of Earth just got catapulted into a new reality in which there are not only extraterrestrial beings (surprise!) but they are also superman! And a group of them are hell-bent on destroying humankind and taking the planet for themselves.It is difficult to see Superman as separate from the whole Kryptonian Krew.It seems that many moviegoers forgot that Bruce Wayne is also human. Sure, he's a hero, but he is flawed.. Just like the rest of us. He is a vigilante, after all.He has let his vigilantism get the better of him. HE is actually the one working outside the boundaries of the law, not Superman. It is the clear head of Alfred that shows us that he has gone into a rather dark place, that he has not seen what is really going on (in Luthor's scheme), and so he chooses to embark on his own scheme scheme to take out the alien invader. He is (allegedly) thinking of the future: if he wipes out the all-powerful alien, then it can't turn on humankind in the future. At least, he convinces himself of that.A philosophical question is raised in the film: should Clark Kent have remained a simple man from Kansas and never have become the Superman? Should he just let people die and let calamities happen? The question is answered for us in the character of Diana Prince/Wonder Woman. She withdrew from mankind (her exact words) and just sat around watching. Watching while people died horrible deaths all around her. So, should Superman have done the same? Do these special beings, these 'metahumans', have some kind of moral imperative to intervene, or should they be allowed to be regular people, too? It seems that humans want it both ways.It seems that humans are saying: \"Don't be a superalien ... except when I and my friends and family are in trouble. Then come save us.\""

"Batman v Superman: Ultimate Edition: If your looking for a quick, cheap thrill then you might not enjoy this film at the time. This movies theatrical version was butchered by WB and in doing so reshaped the story leaving numerous plot holes. So the Ultimate Edition is the full story and the one worth seeing. Watch 'Man of Steel' before seeing this movie. There is much to claw through here, so much so that the audience might easily find themselves exhausted from the overall aggression of the film. However, a lot of the story does work. The action is good, and the emotion feels real most of the time.This film is about Superman trying to become Superman. Trying to help the world, save people, find a place in this world not as an outcast, and yet is looked at has a threat by many. Superman is not from this world, yet He is trying to be human, find a place in this world, be excepted by earths people, and come into his destiny.This film is also about Batman being Batman for 20 years and losing faith in humanity, and fearing Superman, what Superman can do with his powers. Great film, great plot, great visuals. ---Yidioo"
"I didn't see the film in the theaters and just bought the \"Extended Edition \" on Amazon. I never properly saw Man of Steel- i think I rented it and watched it when already exhausted and fell asleep. I saw the mediocre user reviews and horrible reviews from critics of this film.They really have it wrong. This is the very best either Batman or Superman. It has a different take, on things. Much darker then earlier films even darker then the Christopher Nolan Batman films.First of all Christopher Nolan is an Executive Producer. So how bad could it be? I loved Sucker Punch and Zack Snyder was involved with that. So how bad could this be? Hans Zimmer did the music, so how bad could it be?I remember watching the old Superman TV shows and reading the Superman and Batman comics as a little kid and loved them, but i wouldn't call myself a \"fan boy\" of comic universes, like so many younger people today. As an older adult I will admit my favorite TV show of all time was Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but watched it on DVD only after it had finished. I saw the second of the Dark Knight series in the theater, but the other two, I watched on DVD. They were great, but not my favorite films like so many people. i also loved the first couple Superman and Batman films in the older series. Regardless, i was not waiting with baited breath to see Man of Steel or this one.I'm more of a serious film fan, who can watch Stanley Kubrick films over and over and my favorite films in the last twenty years, are Eyes Wide Shut and Intersteller, both of which i've watched multiple times.So, with that said, take it from me, the critics have this film very wrong, just as critics hated 2001: A Space Odyssey when it first came out. This film will have lasting appreciation.Surprised how much I liked Ben Afleck's Batman. it was hard to get into Henry Cavil's scrawnier looking Superman, but it grew on me. Amy Adams was great as Lois Lane, The Gal Gadol Wonder Women was amazing. Lex Luther was terrific, like Nolan's Joker. Jeremy Irons was the best Alfred ever. Holly Hunter and Diane Lane was good too. The movie had bad reviews but made a billion dollars. Hopefully everyone buys the Ultimate Edition and it breaks sales records and the film is re-appreciated. I have no idea what scenes this Ultimate Edition added, but it is pretty perfect. Now I can't wait for Wonder Woman and the Justice League and as soon as I finish writing this am going to watch Man of Steal. I'm into it now!I can only surmise that the bad reviews stem from too much expectations of the rigid fan boy types and the radical changes in tone, we see in this film.Total masterpiece of cinema, but I have a few criticisms. There are a few hollow scenes of typical Idiot cops and authorities getting everything wrong in a cliché type way and it has a few filler scenes of that type and a few moments here and there that felt rushed and cheesy. Maybe not everything restored into the Ultimate Edition should have been. I wish there had been more Kevin Costner scenes."

"The whole entire Batman V Superman movie was great and yes even though it felt slow to the majority of the people who watched it but to me I enjoyed every part and every scene of Batman V Superman and when it got to the fight scenes both batman VS Superman and the Doomsday fight it brought so much drama, intensity, and epic performances. So with that being said I give this movie a good 10/10 because it really did go to my expectations and it brought a powerful performance and a powerful yet epic introduction to the upcoming Justice League."

"When I first wrote a review for this movie a year ago exclaiming my excitement for the film, I had been high off a fresh dose of live-action DC superheroes playing out the beloved comic book stories that I had grown up on. It was all playing out before my eyes and coming to life. After a few months had passed, I began to notice things about the movie that I disliked: little gaps in the story, things that didn't add up, etc. My original rating of a 10 / 10 dropped to an 8 /10. But today it has gone back up to a 10. The extended version of the film not only rectifies the gaps but also silences critics.Many claimed that the movie was too dark or that it just didn't make sense. To those people, I say: \"Pick up a comic book!\" Many of the critics of this particular film were part of the superhero bandwagon that formed when Marvel began its spree of Avengers-related films. In fact, its estimated that over 60% of people who go to see 'superhero' genre films have never picked up a comic book in their life. I would argue that similar numbers could figure to those which view the CW televised DC Universe shows. People complain that DC comics is just too dark but the fact is that these movies are based upon actual comics which are meant to be dark (ex: The Dark Knight Returns, Injustice, etc.). Its like complaining that Game of Thrones (the TV series) sucks because they kill off too many characters. Read the books! Its frustrating to see such a beautiful work of art like Batman V Superman criticized by those ignorant to its universe and its meaning. This movie is in fact a catalyst that opens numerous doorways and leaves true fans in awe of the possibilities for future movies. But regardless of whether or not people choose to educate themselves, this film's DVD/Blu-ray extended version puts the theater release to shame. All of the plot holes and gaps are filled in 30 minutes of extended footage scattered throughout the film. The movie ultimately becomes more complete and people will wish that the movie had shown the full 3 hours of footage in its theatrical debut. As a major DC comics fan, I will of course pick up on things that a comics fan would not, but someone who does not read comics would learn to appreciate this film in its entirety with the extended version. Get your hands on a copy today or find it on Netflix or the internet somewhere!"

"I ignored the bad reviews and watched anyways. This film had a lot to live up to after Civil War was released and I went into this film expecting the worst. It ended up to be the best Superhero film of 2016 to me. One complaint was that this film was more concerned about universe building than telling a great story than Civil War but for me it was the other way around; Civil War felt like a build up to something else and to be honest, I felt that way when I saw the other MCU films. Batman vs Superman however not only had a great story, but it also felt a lot more consistent than Civil War. This film was way more diverse with the cast than the MCU but unlike the MCU, I felt like this film doesn't go overboard with the SJW stuff like the MCU films or The Star Wars Sequel films do. The Visuals were AMAZING, The Score by Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL was AMAZING as well, The Tone is just right as I actually felt for the characters emotionally, The Cinematography kept my eyes glued to the screen, and the script felt really Intelligent and Complex and despite people calling the writing confusing, I was able to piece it together with no problem whatsoever. This film is similar to Empire Strikes back in terms of popularity so over time after the other movies are released, this movie would probably be more popular.This film was way better than I Expected and deserves another chance.

"Its shame to see what critics and marvel fans did to this movie and targeted Zack Snyder for it. I have seen this movie more than 25 times till date. And i enjoy this movie as much as i enjoyed the first time. The fans who have read DC comics, wouldn't be disappointed in this movie. Its dark movie, yes it is. Because the title shows the intense situation at hand. Two superheroes about to rip each other apart for whatever reasons that brought them to this stage. Yes it had to be dark and intense.Only marvel can be stupid enough to show an alien invasion where humans are loosing the battle and the super heroes are cracking jokes while battles as if they are playing ping pong. a person playing Call of Duty game is more serious while playing than the marvel heroes fighting aliens."

"Last week some news came out from somebody online who had claimed to have seen a finished version of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. If you were like me, you've been leery of checking it out because you weren't sure how much might actually be true. Now Zack Snyder has spoken out about the spoiler-filled post, although his response doesn't really clear anything up.In a word, to MTV, he called the post \"hilarious,which might imply that he's saying that it's mostly, if not entirely, untrue. That might be the case, but then again he could have just said it was untrue and he didn't say that. What he did say, however, is that he doesn't like spoilers. While this may seem odd for the director who's most recent trailer appeared to give away the entire movie, Snyder says that's not the case. Even if you've seen the trailer, you can rest easy, as there is much more we have not seen in then finished film. Says Snyder I have the benefit of seeing the movie. It's cool that think it's too much, and I appreciate people not wanting to know, but there's plenty that they don't know. There's a lot of movie that's not in the trailer. In the process of calling the Batman v Superman Reddit review hilarious, Snyder goes on to talk about how he hates it when spoilers come out. The director would much rather that fans see the movie mostly blind. While he understands that some fans may wish to find the answers before hand, he wants his movies to be mysteries going in. If you're, as an audience member, exploring these articles, looking for answers to questions that you have, maybe you're okay with knowing before you go. It's like an individual taste. But like I said, I want people to see the movie without knowing.Spoilers are a topic that mean different things to different people. While most try to avoid them to some degree, the need to solve the mystery is a nearly universal human experience. We have an inclination to want to know the truth, even while also wanting to be surprised. For most of us getting some information is good, but getting all the information is bad, of course, only getting the details that you want can be difficult."
"The theatrical is choppy, poorly edited, hard to follow, with some really good moments mixed in their. The extended is much more fluent and is much easier to follow, it does have a long runtime, which might make it seem a bit dragging on, but if you like long films done right, like Lord of the Rings, you will like this movie as long as you get into the characters and story. Speaking of which, the story starts out perfectly showing Bruce Wayne as a character, and it is very powerful. There are several moments in this movie that are powerful, emotional, and shocking. Characters. Batman is my favorite fictional character of all time, and believe me when I say, Ben Affleck as Batman was perfect, he had the charisma, the anger, and the look of being through some bad stuff Gal Gadot also does perfect as Wonder Woman, but if you want to really see how good she does, go watch the Wonder Woman movie. Henry Call as Superman. I really don't like it when people say Christopher Reeves is better. Don't get me wrong, Reeves does great, but can you imagine him as Superman in this movie? I wouldn't like it. It would be like Adam West playing Batman in The Dark Knight. Henry Cavill does great in this role, I can say everything about him as I said with Ben Affleck. Jesse Eisenberg as Luthor. I thought it was different in a good way. I've heard a criticism for him as being too much like Joker, but is that a bad thing? Joker is my favorite villain, so to see Superman have an enemy that crazy, but still hold the values Luthor needs to be Luthor, I think it is great. The thing I thought this movie was lacking in the first and second acts was humor, at least good humor. If there was more humor, I would've given this movie a ten because it would give a more relaxing feel to the parts that needed it. All in all though, this movie was awesome, it had powerful moments, it was badass, and just plain fun. It had a great story arc and does its job very well."

"*I will be talking about the Ultimate Edition of the film* This was one of the most anticipated CBM of all time. Ever since the arrival and subsequent success of Marvel's The Avengers people have wondered when will DC launch its own cinematic universe, one of the main reasons being the opportunity to finally see titans such as Batman and Superman share the screen together: the ultimate nerd dream. On 2016, the moment finally came for BvS to be released AND.. it performed poorly. Not only did critical reception left a lot to be desired, but fan reactions where surprisingly split after its cinematic debut. People either loved it and called Zack a genius, or hated it and called him a hack. Me, personally, I found myself with middle of the road feelings, for sure, but more leaning towards the negative side with subsequent viewings. The theatrical cut of the film showcased amazing performances, incredible visuals, and action set pieces that seemed like comic book panels come to life, in a good way. However, when it comes to its narrative structure and more technical aspects like editing, the film was seriously flawed. More plot holes than Age of Ultron, questionable character decisions, random editing that lacked cohesion and focus, and forced dramatic moments that lacked any impact because the attempts at character development ranged from limited to nonexistent, especially when it comes to Superman's character. I thought it was a 5/10 movie at best. As such, I was kind of skeptical about the idea of a 30 minute longer version. I say kind of because I know how Zack works. I remember Watchmen being vastly improved with its director's cut, so in a way I was expecting BvS to perform in a similar manner, but I also feared those 30 minutes wold be just there to amplify action and discredit storytelling issues. Oh boy, I'm so glad I was proved wrong. The ultimate cut of the film was infuriating, but not because it was awful, but because it questions the sanity of WB executives and editors and makes you wonder what were they thinking during the editing process. What I got out of the Ultimate Edition was a thought-provoking deconstruction of two very iconic superheroes that gave spotlight to the struggles both of them face when they aren't fighting crime. What I got was an extremely well produced character study on both Batman and Superman in a cynical world, a world dangerously close to our own. We meet Batman as a ruthless, worn out hero that has seen the failure behind his ideals and witnessed some truly horrifying things in his life. Superman, on the other hand, is portrayed as a godlike figure that seeks to do good in the world, but finds himself emotionally conflicted once he realized that every good deed he does leaves behind a trail of destruction (most of it due to Luthor's antics). In my opinion, this is a hugely original approach, one that distances itself from the rest of the competition and delivers a dark, somber, yet relevant superhero movie that understands both characters and gives them real human struggles to deal with. I felt invested in both of them, and hoped that by the end of the film both could find a way to redeem themselves. Their character arcs were very well established during the first two acts of the movie, and by the time we get to the titular climactic battle the emotion behind the jaw-dropping action is intensified. Lex Luthor as a villain was also given more time to develop with this new edition. One of the main criticisms with the original version was the fact that his plan relied too much on conveniences, and the character's mannerisms and mad-scientist attitude was annoying, and that goes without saying his motivations were unclear. Not only do we spend more time understanding his hate for any godlike figure and thus his hatred for Superman, but the added scenes allowed us to witness his entire plan come to fruition. It sells the cold, manipulative, calculating attributes of his comic counterpart. The acting is spot on. Every actor owns his/her role, from Cavill's Superman, to Ben Affleck as Batman, Eisenberg as Luthor, and Gadot as Wonder Woman, whose scenes are brief, but are more than enough to sell the strong and ferocious warrior that she is. Cinematography is stunning, and miles above that of Man of Steel's. And the soundtrack by Zimmer and Junkie XL? Perfect, just perfect. When it comes to flaws, the film still has some of those. The Martha moment, while serving as a pivotal character moment for Batman, felt off in execution, and its understandable that many people got mad at it. If your main complaint about BvS the first time around was its bleak tone and subject matter, this film is still not for you. I understand most were expecting to see the heroes being the most iconic versions of themselves, clashing in an elongated battle and evoking the same feelings The Avengers gave audiences back in 2012. In that sense, the film will remain divisive, but at least I have the comfort of saying that, at the very least, the film is competently made."

"This film was amazing. Ben Affleck was easily the best part of this movie, he brought his a-game as Batman. The chemistry between Affleck & Irons was outstanding. Gal Gadot did a great job as Wonder Woman. The fight between Batman & Superman was awesome. The final fight with Doomsday was outstanding in every way possible. However, there is only one problem with this film and that's Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor. He was sadly missed cast in this role, but then again it's really the fault of Warner Bros. Studios. Overall, this film deliver on almost every level. I highly recommend that you watch the extended version of this film."

"I know I know. I saw it in theaters too, and felt like it could've been so much better. While the Batman element was good, the narrative felt fractured, and the third act was just one long stunt scene. Superman was relegated to a supporting character, and other characters didn't get a chance to shine. And then I chanced on the ultimate cut. Calling it 30 mins of \"extra\" footage is unfair to Zack Snyder because it's exactly these 30 mins that makes the movie a worthy one. What I can say about the theatrical cut is this - It had the blockbuster elements - music, visuals, stunts, CGI. But, it lacked the human elements. The first 20 mins of the movie had it, but not after that. The extended cut in comparison has a flow to the narrative. There are no disjointed scenes, everything flows smoothly, and there's connective tissue. Superman gets to spend some time with his father, and mother. Clark Kent does some investigative journalism. Superman helps the people after the blast. Lois Lane doesn't jump to conclusions, she gets to the bottom of the crime. Lex Luthor apparently had a coherent plan - everything is explained pretty well. Wonder Woman was already good, so there's no change there :) Also, the \"Martha\" scene seems better executed, because it is a few seconds longer, and there's time to breathe it in. So, here's my take on this movie - The theatrical cut was junk. Get the Bluray for ultimate edition, and you shall not be disappointed. I've seen it so many more times now, and it's the definitive cut. It is the movie we deserve. It's a unique take on Batman, and Superman. It's a gritty take on the superhero movie genre, and definitely the best DCEU movie, and the best DC movie since The Dark Knight.P.S. Yes it's dark. We're adults, and we should appreciate mature film making without intentionally silly moments. It attempts to be philosophical, and something deep instead of just trying to make you chuckle."

"This is one of the best superhero movies ever made. Zack Snyder is a magician behind the camera.The reason behind so many complaints is the fact that Warner Bros. marketed this movie as a fight between Batman and Superman. That's not what it is. It's a movie about the origins of the Justice League.The cinematography, the acting and the score are all second to none. This film is phenomenal.P.S: watch the 3 hour extended cut that Snyder intended you to see, not the 2 and a half hour movie that Warner Bros. decided would be better for theaters."

"I don't care what the critics say, this is a very well-done movie. I'll start my review by listing what I like about the movie.1.) Ben Affleck is the best batman to me and it is not close. He pulls off the role of an aging batman extremely well. Also, Zack Snyder's vision of batman is legit. I have always hated batman up until this adaptation of him. Instead of being a conflicted and idealistic batman, this batman is dark, gritty, and 100% a badass. His equipment is decked out with machine guns and he has no aversion to killing people. In fact, he probably kills about 50 criminal by the time this movie is over. The warehouse scene is the coolest batman scene in any movie.2.) The development of a grudge between batman and superman is pulled off flawlessly. It actually makes sense why batman dislikes superman. Then, when they do fight it is about the coolest thing you can expect to see from a superhero film. 3.) I disagree with a lot of people about Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor. In my opinion, he played his role to perfection. 4.) B v S sets up Wonder Woman and Justice League with Gal Gadot's cameo as Wonder Woman and short clips of Aquaman, the Flash, and Cyborg. B v S is one of my favorite superhero films and rewatching it never gets old."

"The theatrical cut of this film is garbage which is why I rated it eight stars instead of nine. The first time I watched this film I didn't like it (not straight out hate but didn't like). Character motivations didn't make any sense, Lex was annoying as s***, editing was sloppy, and it was overly dark and broody for an action superhero movie. A year + a half, five Marvel films, a ton of bad reviews and a Justice League later a thought popped into my head: \"what if I watched BVS again\". This time I didn't have trailers ruining the best moments, I only vaguely remembered the film, and I was conditioned to look at it negatively but something unexpected happened: I actually loved it. Superman was just a normal person that tried to make a difference cause he could that others imposed their own beliefs on. Lex Luthor was a genius that couldn't stand his powerlessness compared to Superman or more accurately a super being. As Alfred said \"The fever, the rage, the feeling of powerlessness that turns good men... cruel\" and you see the same thought process in Batman. Batman, just like Lex Luthor feels powerless in the midst of a god-being and just like Lex he attempts to destroy him so he can get his sense of power back but unlike Lex, Batman learns something. I what is one of the corniest lines of the movie Superman says, \"Martha\" when he knows he can't win against Batman in a late desperate attempt to save his mother. Not only does this name connect with Bruce Wayne but it also shows what really matters to a man of steel: it isn't power, it isn't fame or anything else, it is his Mother and on a broader scale it is people. Lex (who doesn't care about people at all) knows he doesn't have the power so he creates something from his blood and the remains of Zod: A Doomsday for Superman. Not only does this film have depth but it also doesn't always explain it to you which is rare in a blockbuster action superhero flick normally cater to semi-comic book fans and people that want to shove popcorn in their mouths. This film rewards you for really noticing the details while still having massive explosions. One of my favorites is how Lex has all of Batman's branded killed which is why he isn't afraid of the branding at the end or Grandma's Peach Tea as a way of scaring the s*** out of someone. Of course, this film isn't perfect and I do have personal dislikes. The Batman V Superman fight was slow and pretty boring especially after watching such an amazing fight in Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 2 (If you haven't watched the animated Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 1 and 2 you are sorely missing out on something fantastic). Also, the addition of Wonder Woman who pretty much steals a hacker thing, gives it back and then suits up and fights against a giant monster thing. Not to say I don't like Wonder Woman (She is one of my favorite Superheroes of all time who showed not only can woman kick a** but they also don't need to be ashamed of their sexuality or gender) but she wasn't really that helpful to the plot and just brought in to expand the universe which was well done through Lex's superhuman hunting files. Also, the post-apocalyptic scene that was just a dream could have been cut but nothing is perfect except movies like Citizen Kane which isn't a lot of fun to watch cause it is too perfect. So to summarize, the theatrical cut is bad, the ultimate cut is Amazing and the other cut is meh. Please give it a second chance because it deserves it and save a good director from losing grace because of something he didn't do."
"I really liked it, don't know what all the hate is about. I'm actually a Marvel fan from when I was 7 or so, but Superman and Batman together in 1 movie? Just great. And personally I like Ben Affleck even better than Christian Bale as Batman. So just watch and enjoy, I know I did!"

"That's right. We have been waiting for these two heroes to finally meet and fight against each other. This movie is so good in both plot and special effects.Henry Cavill and Ben Affleck have performed well in their acting stages. They are the best superhero actors and they have filmed their fighting scenes very well. The movie starts to show the conflict between the lives of the heroes and now they have blamed each other for it. This movie is amazing and sets up a good plot for Dawn Justice."

"Actually...I didn't know what to expect. When you see Wonder Woman, you know it will be off of Wonder Woman and off of a Wonder Woman story, but with Batman V Superman, I was like, \"hmmmm, so who is this about?\" It was pretty obvious that it would feature many characters, but I thought the introduction to Batman was amazing. Ben Affleck nailed the part, not only as Batman but also as Bruce Wayne. He is my Batman. Henry Cavill continued to be super as the Man of Steel. And he is my Super - Man. A dark story? Yes, without a doubt. Could it have had a few more jokes? Sure. But not all movies or stories need to have jokes when certain events are serious. I really hope people can see this review and take another look at the movie, because, I loved it. I really hope the ratings can go up, eventually. And P.S, this movie is the perfect set up to Justice League."

"I'll start by making it clear I have only ever seen the Ultimate Edition. I'm aware of what was cut out for the theatrical release, so I will concede up front that most of the criticisms about pacing, editing, and missing bits of plot at release were merited.With that caveat out of the way, I must reiterate that this was bar-none the boldest superhero movie I have ever seen. To me, it was arguably the best as well, though \"best\" shouldn't be taken to mean \"most enjoyable.\" That honor easily goes to \"Thor: Ragnarok.\" What makes BvS stand out among other films in the genre is that it takes two characters who have been done to death since the 1970s and brings them up to date. I recently tried to watch \"Superman: The Movie\" for the first time in a number of years, and while it was still good and Reeves will always be iconic, I just couldn't take it seriously. I'll put it this way: If the story in BvS was \"stupid\" in your view but Superman turning back time by spinning the earth backward on its axis didn't seem like one of the dumbest things you have ever seen -in any movie from any genre- to the extent that it outright ruins the movie for you, then your opinion about BvS isn't worth much. Nostalgic bias was always going to be a problem for this movie, and the way people reacted to and reviewed \"Man of Steel\" was telling in this regard.That brings me to Zack Snyder's take on Superman. You know, that guy whose status as the first extraterrestrial ever encountered by humanity was a total non-issue in the old movies. Apparently, Snyder has a similar view to my own in that his take on the Man of Steel makes his being an alien a core piece of his identity. He may look like any other (absurdly attractive) person, but he knows what he is, and that makes him perpetually uncertain of where he fits in this world. He is essentially good and really does care about people, but he struggles to truly empathize with the likes of us. To be human is to be frail, and that is not something he can easily relate to. This is the root of his conflict with Batman.Just as Clark struggles to genuinely relate to most people, Snyder's Batman either refuses to or otherwise just can't relate to Superman. He doesn't see him as anything but a threat regardless of Superman's clear good intentions. Remember, a small group of Kryptonians were able to bring humanity to the brink of extinction in less than a day, and Bruce Wayne is nothing if not a realist. He didn't know the guy from Kansas. He only knew the god from another world.While Batman's anger toward and fear of Superman are readily apparent from the start, Superman's inability to imagine things from Bruce Wayne's perspective only becomes truly apparent during their first real interaction. This reminded me of the animated version of the \"world's finest\" storyline, where Superman judges Batman harshly for using fear tactics and threats of violence (also, actual violence) to get the job done. Superman wasn't willing to consider what it would take for a human man to fight criminals and save innocents, or what that life would do to him over time. Just as Batman didn't see the guy from Kansas, Superman didn't see the man who lives his life trapped in one brutal, unthinkably traumatic moment (this was beautifully conveyed during the film's opening moments), and had spent his whole adult life bearing witness to humanity at its absolute worst.The conflict between these two characters is as old as human history. They want the same things, but they can't understand one another. So they fight. And what a fight it was.Watching a fight between, say, Captain America and Iron Man was, to me, more frustrating than anything because each understood the other's perspective perfectly. The fight between Batman and Superman in BvS was genuinely gut-wrenching, as intended, because they would have understood one another if either had tried. The whole sequence hilighted Batman's tactical prowess and ability to control a situation. Maybe the most badass thing about the fight was that it ended exactly where Batman planned. That brings me to the big elephant in the room named \"Martha.\"I can't recall exactly which YouTuber put it this way, but if you thought the \"save Martha\" exchange was about their mothers having the same name, you had your brain turned off. The brain-on people have explained this to death, but it bears repeating. This was the moment when Superman became humanized to Batman. He was about to die, and his only concern was for his adoptive human mother. He still believed that the man about to take his life would do the right thing. Even with the cowl on, there was no mistaking the look on Batman's face. It was the look of shame, guilt, and sudden uncertainty that says \"What am I doing?\" Turns out even the most brutal, angry version of Bruce Wayne is better than Tony Stark at knowing right from wrong. At knowing that he had gone too far.From there, the third act was a series of truly impressive (albeit mostly CGI) fight sequences, beginning with what I regard as the undisputed champion of Batman fights. Nothing in the Nolan movies (and especially nothing in the Burton movies) even came close. Go ahead, try to convince yourself that Batman and Bane taking turns punching one another in the face until Bane's mask broke was a good fight sequence. No, this was a fight straight out of \"Arkham Knight,\" and it was glorious. The battle against Doomsday really was one for the books. From the moment Wonder Woman arrived accompanied by the intense sounds of Tina Guo's electric cello to Superman's tragic, heroic death at the hands of Doomsday, I was glued to the screen. Sure, the mere presence of Doomsday spoiled the end to a degree, but watching the Man of Steel laboring to carry that kryptonite spear towards certain death was no less impactful. A brief word on Jesse Eisenberg's take on Lex Luthor. At least one other reviewer on this site already said it best when they pointed out that this was his origin story. If you consider his scheme objectively, he is actually one of the more formidable incarnations of the character. If we're lucky, we'll eventually get to see a Snyder Cut of \"Justice League\" and find out where this story was actually meant to go. For the record, Joss Whedon and Danny Elfman both should have said \"no\" to taking a dump on someone else's art."
"BATMAN V SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE brings a fantastic surprise to a smash-hit team-up with one of the worlds most beloved DC Comics' icons of all time. The movie delivers spectacular casting, and fantastic acting with different characters having their shine in each scenes.The story follows Clark Kent/Superman who becomes a threat, after the destruction in Metropolis in Man Of Steel.(2013). Batman/Bruce Wayne sees him as a threat and begins his war on Superman.The movie brings spectacular storytelling, it tells the complications of human against alien who are on the same side, and the first meeting of Batman and Superman. The story of Bruce Wayne, with his many years of The Caped Crusader, sends him on a spiral of \"out of control\", sheer anger, and builds tension to wanting to defeat the Man of Steel. Snyder has fantastically gave this storytelling an exciting nod to the comics.Lex Luthor, played by Jesse Einsberg, delivers a very interesting performance, but very differently by him showing is his \"origin\" before he becomes a bald foe to the Man of Steel. He shows that his love of \"god vs man\" terrorises mankind when he ultimately creates Doomsday, and Batman realises Superman's inner heroism.It packs so many great \"out of nowhere\" excitement, including a first-look of the fearful Wonder Woman a.k.a. Diana Prince, played by Gal Gadot, and a fresh-new glimpse of the superhero DC canon: The Justice League.WATCH THIS MOVIE! The critics are out of their mind. It's a fun-packed action adventure which still keeps the movie enjoyable until it's final minutes of the movie. It's a FANTASTIC MOVIE! BEN AFFLECK AS BATMAN... is Incredible!A 10/10 overall!"
"I want to go on record as saying that this is a truly thrilling cinematic experience in so many ways. If pressed, I guess I could acknowledge that there were a couple ... let's say \"clumsy\" moments. And in a film that runs to three hours, that hardly seems like a significant issue, certainly not enough to rate it with fewer than 9 stars.This film has everything. There is dramatic tension right from the start. There is a magnificent story arc that picks up quite seamlessly from 'Man of Steel' and propels the viewer not only into the life of Clark Kent/Superman but also of Bruce Wayne/Batman.The villain is no mere cartoon of a villain; he is truly thoroughly (and apparently irrevocably) diabolical. He is a psychopath, and you wish for his death over and over and over. You want Superman to reduce him to ash with the power of his eyes.I have read a number of viewers' reviews, and it seems that the people who disliked the film / gave it a low rating had rather unfair and unrealistic expectations of it. That is, their own prejudices about how the plot could/should unfold or what the character development could/should be, etc. ruined the film for them. And that is a shame.My thought is: I settle into my seat, wait for the lights to dim, and then I wait to be transported by the film. I accept it, lock, stock, and barrel.As another reviewer remarked, I love how the film begins from the point of view of Bruce Wayne as he is among people on the ground who have fallen victim to the attack of Zod and the other Kryptonians.Why would Bruce Wayne not like Superman? Why would the good people of Earth hurl insults at Superman and burn him in effigy (on the news)? Because the good people of Earth just got catapulted into a new reality in which there are not only extraterrestrial beings (surprise!) but they are also superman! And a group of them are hell-bent on destroying humankind and taking the planet for themselves.It is difficult to see Superman as separate from the whole Kryptonian Krew.It seems that many moviegoers forgot that Bruce Wayne is also human. Sure, he's a hero, but he is flawed.. Just like the rest of us. He is a vigilante, after all.He has let his vigilantism get the better of him. HE is actually the one working outside the boundaries of the law, not Superman. It is the clear head of Alfred that shows us that he has gone into a rather dark place, that he has not seen what is really going on (in Luthor's scheme), and so he chooses to embark on his own scheme scheme to take out the alien invader. He is (allegedly) thinking of the future: if he wipes out the all-powerful alien, then it can't turn on humankind in the future. At least, he convinces himself of that.A philosophical question is raised in the film: should Clark Kent have remained a simple man from Kansas and never have become the Superman? Should he just let people die and let calamities happen? The question is answered for us in the character of Diana Prince/Wonder Woman. She withdrew from mankind (her exact words) and just sat around watching. Watching while people died horrible deaths all around her. So, should Superman have done the same? Do these special beings, these 'metahumans', have some kind of moral imperative to intervene, or should they be allowed to be regular people, too? It seems that humans want it both ways.It seems that humans are saying: \"Don't be a superalien ... except when I and my friends and family are in trouble. Then come save us.\""

"Batman v Superman: Ultimate Edition: If your looking for a quick, cheap thrill then you might not enjoy this film at the time. This movies theatrical version was butchered by WB and in doing so reshaped the story leaving numerous plot holes. So the Ultimate Edition is the full story and the one worth seeing. Watch 'Man of Steel' before seeing this movie. There is much to claw through here, so much so that the audience might easily find themselves exhausted from the overall aggression of the film. However, a lot of the story does work. The action is good, and the emotion feels real most of the time.This film is about Superman trying to become Superman. Trying to help the world, save people, find a place in this world not as an outcast, and yet is looked at has a threat by many. Superman is not from this world, yet He is trying to be human, find a place in this world, be excepted by earths people, and come into his destiny.This film is also about Batman being Batman for 20 years and losing faith in humanity, and fearing Superman, what Superman can do with his powers. Great film, great plot, great visuals. ---Yidioo"
"I didn't see the film in the theaters and just bought the \"Extended Edition \" on Amazon. I never properly saw Man of Steel- i think I rented it and watched it when already exhausted and fell asleep. I saw the mediocre user reviews and horrible reviews from critics of this film.They really have it wrong. This is the very best either Batman or Superman. It has a different take, on things. Much darker then earlier films even darker then the Christopher Nolan Batman films.First of all Christopher Nolan is an Executive Producer. So how bad could it be? I loved Sucker Punch and Zack Snyder was involved with that. So how bad could this be? Hans Zimmer did the music, so how bad could it be?I remember watching the old Superman TV shows and reading the Superman and Batman comics as a little kid and loved them, but i wouldn't call myself a \"fan boy\" of comic universes, like so many younger people today. As an older adult I will admit my favorite TV show of all time was Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but watched it on DVD only after it had finished. I saw the second of the Dark Knight series in the theater, but the other two, I watched on DVD. They were great, but not my favorite films like so many people. i also loved the first couple Superman and Batman films in the older series. Regardless, i was not waiting with baited breath to see Man of Steel or this one.I'm more of a serious film fan, who can watch Stanley Kubrick films over and over and my favorite films in the last twenty years, are Eyes Wide Shut and Intersteller, both of which i've watched multiple times.So, with that said, take it from me, the critics have this film very wrong, just as critics hated 2001: A Space Odyssey when it first came out. This film will have lasting appreciation.Surprised how much I liked Ben Afleck's Batman. it was hard to get into Henry Cavil's scrawnier looking Superman, but it grew on me. Amy Adams was great as Lois Lane, The Gal Gadol Wonder Women was amazing. Lex Luther was terrific, like Nolan's Joker. Jeremy Irons was the best Alfred ever. Holly Hunter and Diane Lane was good too. The movie had bad reviews but made a billion dollars. Hopefully everyone buys the Ultimate Edition and it breaks sales records and the film is re-appreciated. I have no idea what scenes this Ultimate Edition added, but it is pretty perfect. Now I can't wait for Wonder Woman and the Justice League and as soon as I finish writing this am going to watch Man of Steal. I'm into it now!I can only surmise that the bad reviews stem from too much expectations of the rigid fan boy types and the radical changes in tone, we see in this film.Total masterpiece of cinema, but I have a few criticisms. There are a few hollow scenes of typical Idiot cops and authorities getting everything wrong in a cliché type way and it has a few filler scenes of that type and a few moments here and there that felt rushed and cheesy. Maybe not everything restored into the Ultimate Edition should have been. I wish there had been more Kevin Costner scenes."

"The whole entire Batman V Superman movie was great and yes even though it felt slow to the majority of the people who watched it but to me I enjoyed every part and every scene of Batman V Superman and when it got to the fight scenes both batman VS Superman and the Doomsday fight it brought so much drama, intensity, and epic performances. So with that being said I give this movie a good 10/10 because it really did go to my expectations and it brought a powerful performance and a powerful yet epic introduction to the upcoming Justice League."

"When I first wrote a review for this movie a year ago exclaiming my excitement for the film, I had been high off a fresh dose of live-action DC superheroes playing out the beloved comic book stories that I had grown up on. It was all playing out before my eyes and coming to life. After a few months had passed, I began to notice things about the movie that I disliked: little gaps in the story, things that didn't add up, etc. My original rating of a 10 / 10 dropped to an 8 /10. But today it has gone back up to a 10. The extended version of the film not only rectifies the gaps but also silences critics.Many claimed that the movie was too dark or that it just didn't make sense. To those people, I say: \"Pick up a comic book!\" Many of the critics of this particular film were part of the superhero bandwagon that formed when Marvel began its spree of Avengers-related films. In fact, its estimated that over 60% of people who go to see 'superhero' genre films have never picked up a comic book in their life. I would argue that similar numbers could figure to those which view the CW televised DC Universe shows. People complain that DC comics is just too dark but the fact is that these movies are based upon actual comics which are meant to be dark (ex: The Dark Knight Returns, Injustice, etc.). Its like complaining that Game of Thrones (the TV series) sucks because they kill off too many characters. Read the books! Its frustrating to see such a beautiful work of art like Batman V Superman criticized by those ignorant to its universe and its meaning. This movie is in fact a catalyst that opens numerous doorways and leaves true fans in awe of the possibilities for future movies. But regardless of whether or not people choose to educate themselves, this film's DVD/Blu-ray extended version puts the theater release to shame. All of the plot holes and gaps are filled in 30 minutes of extended footage scattered throughout the film. The movie ultimately becomes more complete and people will wish that the movie had shown the full 3 hours of footage in its theatrical debut. As a major DC comics fan, I will of course pick up on things that a comics fan would not, but someone who does not read comics would learn to appreciate this film in its entirety with the extended version. Get your hands on a copy today or find it on Netflix or the internet somewhere!"

"I ignored the bad reviews and watched anyways. This film had a lot to live up to after Civil War was released and I went into this film expecting the worst. It ended up to be the best Superhero film of 2016 to me. One complaint was that this film was more concerned about universe building than telling a great story than Civil War but for me it was the other way around; Civil War felt like a build up to something else and to be honest, I felt that way when I saw the other MCU films. Batman vs Superman however not only had a great story, but it also felt a lot more consistent than Civil War. This film was way more diverse with the cast than the MCU but unlike the MCU, I felt like this film doesn't go overboard with the SJW stuff like the MCU films or The Star Wars Sequel films do. The Visuals were AMAZING, The Score by Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL was AMAZING as well, The Tone is just right as I actually felt for the characters emotionally, The Cinematography kept my eyes glued to the screen, and the script felt really Intelligent and Complex and despite people calling the writing confusing, I was able to piece it together with no problem whatsoever. This film is similar to Empire Strikes back in terms of popularity so over time after the other movies are released, this movie would probably be more popular.This film was way better than I Expected and deserves another chance.

"Its shame to see what critics and marvel fans did to this movie and targeted Zack Snyder for it. I have seen this movie more than 25 times till date. And i enjoy this movie as much as i enjoyed the first time. The fans who have read DC comics, wouldn't be disappointed in this movie. Its dark movie, yes it is. Because the title shows the intense situation at hand. Two superheroes about to rip each other apart for whatever reasons that brought them to this stage. Yes it had to be dark and intense.Only marvel can be stupid enough to show an alien invasion where humans are loosing the battle and the super heroes are cracking jokes while battles as if they are playing ping pong. a person playing Call of Duty game is more serious while playing than the marvel heroes fighting aliens."

"Last week some news came out from somebody online who had claimed to have seen a finished version of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. If you were like me, you've been leery of checking it out because you weren't sure how much might actually be true. Now Zack Snyder has spoken out about the spoiler-filled post, although his response doesn't really clear anything up.In a word, to MTV, he called the post \"hilarious,which might imply that he's saying that it's mostly, if not entirely, untrue. That might be the case, but then again he could have just said it was untrue and he didn't say that. What he did say, however, is that he doesn't like spoilers. While this may seem odd for the director who's most recent trailer appeared to give away the entire movie, Snyder says that's not the case. Even if you've seen the trailer, you can rest easy, as there is much more we have not seen in then finished film. Says Snyder I have the benefit of seeing the movie. It's cool that think it's too much, and I appreciate people not wanting to know, but there's plenty that they don't know. There's a lot of movie that's not in the trailer. In the process of calling the Batman v Superman Reddit review hilarious, Snyder goes on to talk about how he hates it when spoilers come out. The director would much rather that fans see the movie mostly blind. While he understands that some fans may wish to find the answers before hand, he wants his movies to be mysteries going in. If you're, as an audience member, exploring these articles, looking for answers to questions that you have, maybe you're okay with knowing before you go. It's like an individual taste. But like I said, I want people to see the movie without knowing.Spoilers are a topic that mean different things to different people. While most try to avoid them to some degree, the need to solve the mystery is a nearly universal human experience. We have an inclination to want to know the truth, even while also wanting to be surprised. For most of us getting some information is good, but getting all the information is bad, of course, only getting the details that you want can be difficult."
"The theatrical is choppy, poorly edited, hard to follow, with some really good moments mixed in their. The extended is much more fluent and is much easier to follow, it does have a long runtime, which might make it seem a bit dragging on, but if you like long films done right, like Lord of the Rings, you will like this movie as long as you get into the characters and story. Speaking of which, the story starts out perfectly showing Bruce Wayne as a character, and it is very powerful. There are several moments in this movie that are powerful, emotional, and shocking. Characters. Batman is my favorite fictional character of all time, and believe me when I say, Ben Affleck as Batman was perfect, he had the charisma, the anger, and the look of being through some bad stuff Gal Gadot also does perfect as Wonder Woman, but if you want to really see how good she does, go watch the Wonder Woman movie. Henry Call as Superman. I really don't like it when people say Christopher Reeves is better. Don't get me wrong, Reeves does great, but can you imagine him as Superman in this movie? I wouldn't like it. It would be like Adam West playing Batman in The Dark Knight. Henry Cavill does great in this role, I can say everything about him as I said with Ben Affleck. Jesse Eisenberg as Luthor. I thought it was different in a good way. I've heard a criticism for him as being too much like Joker, but is that a bad thing? Joker is my favorite villain, so to see Superman have an enemy that crazy, but still hold the values Luthor needs to be Luthor, I think it is great. The thing I thought this movie was lacking in the first and second acts was humor, at least good humor. If there was more humor, I would've given this movie a ten because it would give a more relaxing feel to the parts that needed it. All in all though, this movie was awesome, it had powerful moments, it was badass, and just plain fun. It had a great story arc and does its job very well."

"*I will be talking about the Ultimate Edition of the film* This was one of the most anticipated CBM of all time. Ever since the arrival and subsequent success of Marvel's The Avengers people have wondered when will DC launch its own cinematic universe, one of the main reasons being the opportunity to finally see titans such as Batman and Superman share the screen together: the ultimate nerd dream. On 2016, the moment finally came for BvS to be released AND.. it performed poorly. Not only did critical reception left a lot to be desired, but fan reactions where surprisingly split after its cinematic debut. People either loved it and called Zack a genius, or hated it and called him a hack. Me, personally, I found myself with middle of the road feelings, for sure, but more leaning towards the negative side with subsequent viewings. The theatrical cut of the film showcased amazing performances, incredible visuals, and action set pieces that seemed like comic book panels come to life, in a good way. However, when it comes to its narrative structure and more technical aspects like editing, the film was seriously flawed. More plot holes than Age of Ultron, questionable character decisions, random editing that lacked cohesion and focus, and forced dramatic moments that lacked any impact because the attempts at character development ranged from limited to nonexistent, especially when it comes to Superman's character. I thought it was a 5/10 movie at best. As such, I was kind of skeptical about the idea of a 30 minute longer version. I say kind of because I know how Zack works. I remember Watchmen being vastly improved with its director's cut, so in a way I was expecting BvS to perform in a similar manner, but I also feared those 30 minutes wold be just there to amplify action and discredit storytelling issues. Oh boy, I'm so glad I was proved wrong. The ultimate cut of the film was infuriating, but not because it was awful, but because it questions the sanity of WB executives and editors and makes you wonder what were they thinking during the editing process. What I got out of the Ultimate Edition was a thought-provoking deconstruction of two very iconic superheroes that gave spotlight to the struggles both of them face when they aren't fighting crime. What I got was an extremely well produced character study on both Batman and Superman in a cynical world, a world dangerously close to our own. We meet Batman as a ruthless, worn out hero that has seen the failure behind his ideals and witnessed some truly horrifying things in his life. Superman, on the other hand, is portrayed as a godlike figure that seeks to do good in the world, but finds himself emotionally conflicted once he realized that every good deed he does leaves behind a trail of destruction (most of it due to Luthor's antics). In my opinion, this is a hugely original approach, one that distances itself from the rest of the competition and delivers a dark, somber, yet relevant superhero movie that understands both characters and gives them real human struggles to deal with. I felt invested in both of them, and hoped that by the end of the film both could find a way to redeem themselves. Their character arcs were very well established during the first two acts of the movie, and by the time we get to the titular climactic battle the emotion behind the jaw-dropping action is intensified. Lex Luthor as a villain was also given more time to develop with this new edition. One of the main criticisms with the original version was the fact that his plan relied too much on conveniences, and the character's mannerisms and mad-scientist attitude was annoying, and that goes without saying his motivations were unclear. Not only do we spend more time understanding his hate for any godlike figure and thus his hatred for Superman, but the added scenes allowed us to witness his entire plan come to fruition. It sells the cold, manipulative, calculating attributes of his comic counterpart. The acting is spot on. Every actor owns his/her role, from Cavill's Superman, to Ben Affleck as Batman, Eisenberg as Luthor, and Gadot as Wonder Woman, whose scenes are brief, but are more than enough to sell the strong and ferocious warrior that she is. Cinematography is stunning, and miles above that of Man of Steel's. And the soundtrack by Zimmer and Junkie XL? Perfect, just perfect. When it comes to flaws, the film still has some of those. The Martha moment, while serving as a pivotal character moment for Batman, felt off in execution, and its understandable that many people got mad at it. If your main complaint about BvS the first time around was its bleak tone and subject matter, this film is still not for you. I understand most were expecting to see the heroes being the most iconic versions of themselves, clashing in an elongated battle and evoking the same feelings The Avengers gave audiences back in 2012. In that sense, the film will remain divisive, but at least I have the comfort of saying that, at the very least, the film is competently made."

"This film was amazing. Ben Affleck was easily the best part of this movie, he brought his a-game as Batman. The chemistry between Affleck & Irons was outstanding. Gal Gadot did a great job as Wonder Woman. The fight between Batman & Superman was awesome. The final fight with Doomsday was outstanding in every way possible. However, there is only one problem with this film and that's Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor. He was sadly missed cast in this role, but then again it's really the fault of Warner Bros. Studios. Overall, this film deliver on almost every level. I highly recommend that you watch the extended version of this film."

"I know I know. I saw it in theaters too, and felt like it could've been so much better. While the Batman element was good, the narrative felt fractured, and the third act was just one long stunt scene. Superman was relegated to a supporting character, and other characters didn't get a chance to shine. And then I chanced on the ultimate cut. Calling it 30 mins of \"extra\" footage is unfair to Zack Snyder because it's exactly these 30 mins that makes the movie a worthy one. What I can say about the theatrical cut is this - It had the blockbuster elements - music, visuals, stunts, CGI. But, it lacked the human elements. The first 20 mins of the movie had it, but not after that. The extended cut in comparison has a flow to the narrative. There are no disjointed scenes, everything flows smoothly, and there's connective tissue. Superman gets to spend some time with his father, and mother. Clark Kent does some investigative journalism. Superman helps the people after the blast. Lois Lane doesn't jump to conclusions, she gets to the bottom of the crime. Lex Luthor apparently had a coherent plan - everything is explained pretty well. Wonder Woman was already good, so there's no change there :) Also, the \"Martha\" scene seems better executed, because it is a few seconds longer, and there's time to breathe it in. So, here's my take on this movie - The theatrical cut was junk. Get the Bluray for ultimate edition, and you shall not be disappointed. I've seen it so many more times now, and it's the definitive cut. It is the movie we deserve. It's a unique take on Batman, and Superman. It's a gritty take on the superhero movie genre, and definitely the best DCEU movie, and the best DC movie since The Dark Knight.P.S. Yes it's dark. We're adults, and we should appreciate mature film making without intentionally silly moments. It attempts to be philosophical, and something deep instead of just trying to make you chuckle."

"This is one of the best superhero movies ever made. Zack Snyder is a magician behind the camera.The reason behind so many complaints is the fact that Warner Bros. marketed this movie as a fight between Batman and Superman. That's not what it is. It's a movie about the origins of the Justice League.The cinematography, the acting and the score are all second to none. This film is phenomenal.P.S: watch the 3 hour extended cut that Snyder intended you to see, not the 2 and a half hour movie that Warner Bros. decided would be better for theaters."

"I don't care what the critics say, this is a very well-done movie. I'll start my review by listing what I like about the movie.1.) Ben Affleck is the best batman to me and it is not close. He pulls off the role of an aging batman extremely well. Also, Zack Snyder's vision of batman is legit. I have always hated batman up until this adaptation of him. Instead of being a conflicted and idealistic batman, this batman is dark, gritty, and 100% a badass. His equipment is decked out with machine guns and he has no aversion to killing people. In fact, he probably kills about 50 criminal by the time this movie is over. The warehouse scene is the coolest batman scene in any movie.2.) The development of a grudge between batman and superman is pulled off flawlessly. It actually makes sense why batman dislikes superman. Then, when they do fight it is about the coolest thing you can expect to see from a superhero film. 3.) I disagree with a lot of people about Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor. In my opinion, he played his role to perfection. 4.) B v S sets up Wonder Woman and Justice League with Gal Gadot's cameo as Wonder Woman and short clips of Aquaman, the Flash, and Cyborg. B v S is one of my favorite superhero films and rewatching it never gets old."

"The theatrical cut of this film is garbage which is why I rated it eight stars instead of nine. The first time I watched this film I didn't like it (not straight out hate but didn't like). Character motivations didn't make any sense, Lex was annoying as s***, editing was sloppy, and it was overly dark and broody for an action superhero movie. A year + a half, five Marvel films, a ton of bad reviews and a Justice League later a thought popped into my head: \"what if I watched BVS again\". This time I didn't have trailers ruining the best moments, I only vaguely remembered the film, and I was conditioned to look at it negatively but something unexpected happened: I actually loved it. Superman was just a normal person that tried to make a difference cause he could that others imposed their own beliefs on. Lex Luthor was a genius that couldn't stand his powerlessness compared to Superman or more accurately a super being. As Alfred said \"The fever, the rage, the feeling of powerlessness that turns good men... cruel\" and you see the same thought process in Batman. Batman, just like Lex Luthor feels powerless in the midst of a god-being and just like Lex he attempts to destroy him so he can get his sense of power back but unlike Lex, Batman learns something. I what is one of the corniest lines of the movie Superman says, \"Martha\" when he knows he can't win against Batman in a late desperate attempt to save his mother. Not only does this name connect with Bruce Wayne but it also shows what really matters to a man of steel: it isn't power, it isn't fame or anything else, it is his Mother and on a broader scale it is people. Lex (who doesn't care about people at all) knows he doesn't have the power so he creates something from his blood and the remains of Zod: A Doomsday for Superman. Not only does this film have depth but it also doesn't always explain it to you which is rare in a blockbuster action superhero flick normally cater to semi-comic book fans and people that want to shove popcorn in their mouths. This film rewards you for really noticing the details while still having massive explosions. One of my favorites is how Lex has all of Batman's branded killed which is why he isn't afraid of the branding at the end or Grandma's Peach Tea as a way of scaring the s*** out of someone. Of course, this film isn't perfect and I do have personal dislikes. The Batman V Superman fight was slow and pretty boring especially after watching such an amazing fight in Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 2 (If you haven't watched the animated Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 1 and 2 you are sorely missing out on something fantastic). Also, the addition of Wonder Woman who pretty much steals a hacker thing, gives it back and then suits up and fights against a giant monster thing. Not to say I don't like Wonder Woman (She is one of my favorite Superheroes of all time who showed not only can woman kick a** but they also don't need to be ashamed of their sexuality or gender) but she wasn't really that helpful to the plot and just brought in to expand the universe which was well done through Lex's superhuman hunting files. Also, the post-apocalyptic scene that was just a dream could have been cut but nothing is perfect except movies like Citizen Kane which isn't a lot of fun to watch cause it is too perfect. So to summarize, the theatrical cut is bad, the ultimate cut is Amazing and the other cut is meh. Please give it a second chance because it deserves it and save a good director from losing grace because of something he didn't do."
"I really liked it, don't know what all the hate is about. I'm actually a Marvel fan from when I was 7 or so, but Superman and Batman together in 1 movie? Just great. And personally I like Ben Affleck even better than Christian Bale as Batman. So just watch and enjoy, I know I did!"

"That's right. We have been waiting for these two heroes to finally meet and fight against each other. This movie is so good in both plot and special effects.Henry Cavill and Ben Affleck have performed well in their acting stages. They are the best superhero actors and they have filmed their fighting scenes very well. The movie starts to show the conflict between the lives of the heroes and now they have blamed each other for it. This movie is amazing and sets up a good plot for Dawn Justice."

"Actually...I didn't know what to expect. When you see Wonder Woman, you know it will be off of Wonder Woman and off of a Wonder Woman story, but with Batman V Superman, I was like, \"hmmmm, so who is this about?\" It was pretty obvious that it would feature many characters, but I thought the introduction to Batman was amazing. Ben Affleck nailed the part, not only as Batman but also as Bruce Wayne. He is my Batman. Henry Cavill continued to be super as the Man of Steel. And he is my Super - Man. A dark story? Yes, without a doubt. Could it have had a few more jokes? Sure. But not all movies or stories need to have jokes when certain events are serious. I really hope people can see this review and take another look at the movie, because, I loved it. I really hope the ratings can go up, eventually. And P.S, this movie is the perfect set up to Justice League."

"I'll start by making it clear I have only ever seen the Ultimate Edition. I'm aware of what was cut out for the theatrical release, so I will concede up front that most of the criticisms about pacing, editing, and missing bits of plot at release were merited.With that caveat out of the way, I must reiterate that this was bar-none the boldest superhero movie I have ever seen. To me, it was arguably the best as well, though \"best\" shouldn't be taken to mean \"most enjoyable.\" That honor easily goes to \"Thor: Ragnarok.\" What makes BvS stand out among other films in the genre is that it takes two characters who have been done to death since the 1970s and brings them up to date. I recently tried to watch \"Superman: The Movie\" for the first time in a number of years, and while it was still good and Reeves will always be iconic, I just couldn't take it seriously. I'll put it this way: If the story in BvS was \"stupid\" in your view but Superman turning back time by spinning the earth backward on its axis didn't seem like one of the dumbest things you have ever seen -in any movie from any genre- to the extent that it outright ruins the movie for you, then your opinion about BvS isn't worth much. Nostalgic bias was always going to be a problem for this movie, and the way people reacted to and reviewed \"Man of Steel\" was telling in this regard.That brings me to Zack Snyder's take on Superman. You know, that guy whose status as the first extraterrestrial ever encountered by humanity was a total non-issue in the old movies. Apparently, Snyder has a similar view to my own in that his take on the Man of Steel makes his being an alien a core piece of his identity. He may look like any other (absurdly attractive) person, but he knows what he is, and that makes him perpetually uncertain of where he fits in this world. He is essentially good and really does care about people, but he struggles to truly empathize with the likes of us. To be human is to be frail, and that is not something he can easily relate to. This is the root of his conflict with Batman.Just as Clark struggles to genuinely relate to most people, Snyder's Batman either refuses to or otherwise just can't relate to Superman. He doesn't see him as anything but a threat regardless of Superman's clear good intentions. Remember, a small group of Kryptonians were able to bring humanity to the brink of extinction in less than a day, and Bruce Wayne is nothing if not a realist. He didn't know the guy from Kansas. He only knew the god from another world.While Batman's anger toward and fear of Superman are readily apparent from the start, Superman's inability to imagine things from Bruce Wayne's perspective only becomes truly apparent during their first real interaction. This reminded me of the animated version of the \"world's finest\" storyline, where Superman judges Batman harshly for using fear tactics and threats of violence (also, actual violence) to get the job done. Superman wasn't willing to consider what it would take for a human man to fight criminals and save innocents, or what that life would do to him over time. Just as Batman didn't see the guy from Kansas, Superman didn't see the man who lives his life trapped in one brutal, unthinkably traumatic moment (this was beautifully conveyed during the film's opening moments), and had spent his whole adult life bearing witness to humanity at its absolute worst.The conflict between these two characters is as old as human history. They want the same things, but they can't understand one another. So they fight. And what a fight it was.Watching a fight between, say, Captain America and Iron Man was, to me, more frustrating than anything because each understood the other's perspective perfectly. The fight between Batman and Superman in BvS was genuinely gut-wrenching, as intended, because they would have understood one another if either had tried. The whole sequence hilighted Batman's tactical prowess and ability to control a situation. Maybe the most badass thing about the fight was that it ended exactly where Batman planned. That brings me to the big elephant in the room named \"Martha.\"I can't recall exactly which YouTuber put it this way, but if you thought the \"save Martha\" exchange was about their mothers having the same name, you had your brain turned off. The brain-on people have explained this to death, but it bears repeating. This was the moment when Superman became humanized to Batman. He was about to die, and his only concern was for his adoptive human mother. He still believed that the man about to take his life would do the right thing. Even with the cowl on, there was no mistaking the look on Batman's face. It was the look of shame, guilt, and sudden uncertainty that says \"What am I doing?\" Turns out even the most brutal, angry version of Bruce Wayne is better than Tony Stark at knowing right from wrong. At knowing that he had gone too far.From there, the third act was a series of truly impressive (albeit mostly CGI) fight sequences, beginning with what I regard as the undisputed champion of Batman fights. Nothing in the Nolan movies (and especially nothing in the Burton movies) even came close. Go ahead, try to convince yourself that Batman and Bane taking turns punching one another in the face until Bane's mask broke was a good fight sequence. No, this was a fight straight out of \"Arkham Knight,\" and it was glorious. The battle against Doomsday really was one for the books. From the moment Wonder Woman arrived accompanied by the intense sounds of Tina Guo's electric cello to Superman's tragic, heroic death at the hands of Doomsday, I was glued to the screen. Sure, the mere presence of Doomsday spoiled the end to a degree, but watching the Man of Steel laboring to carry that kryptonite spear towards certain death was no less impactful. A brief word on Jesse Eisenberg's take on Lex Luthor. At least one other reviewer on this site already said it best when they pointed out that this was his origin story. If you consider his scheme objectively, he is actually one of the more formidable incarnations of the character. If we're lucky, we'll eventually get to see a Snyder Cut of \"Justice League\" and find out where this story was actually meant to go. For the record, Joss Whedon and Danny Elfman both should have said \"no\" to taking a dump on someone else's art."
"BATMAN V SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE brings a fantastic surprise to a smash-hit team-up with one of the worlds most beloved DC Comics' icons of all time. The movie delivers spectacular casting, and fantastic acting with different characters having their shine in each scenes.The story follows Clark Kent/Superman who becomes a threat, after the destruction in Metropolis in Man Of Steel.(2013). Batman/Bruce Wayne sees him as a threat and begins his war on Superman.The movie brings spectacular storytelling, it tells the complications of human against alien who are on the same side, and the first meeting of Batman and Superman. The story of Bruce Wayne, with his many years of The Caped Crusader, sends him on a spiral of \"out of control\", sheer anger, and builds tension to wanting to defeat the Man of Steel. Snyder has fantastically gave this storytelling an exciting nod to the comics.Lex Luthor, played by Jesse Einsberg, delivers a very interesting performance, but very differently by him showing is his \"origin\" before he becomes a bald foe to the Man of Steel. He shows that his love of \"god vs man\" terrorises mankind when he ultimately creates Doomsday, and Batman realises Superman's inner heroism.It packs so many great \"out of nowhere\" excitement, including a first-look of the fearful Wonder Woman a.k.a. Diana Prince, played by Gal Gadot, and a fresh-new glimpse of the superhero DC canon: The Justice League.WATCH THIS MOVIE! The critics are out of their mind. It's a fun-packed action adventure which still keeps the movie enjoyable until it's final minutes of the movie. It's a FANTASTIC MOVIE! BEN AFFLECK AS BATMAN... is Incredible!A 10/10 overall!"
"I want to go on record as saying that this is a truly thrilling cinematic experience in so many ways. If pressed, I guess I could acknowledge that there were a couple ... let's say \"clumsy\" moments. And in a film that runs to three hours, that hardly seems like a significant issue, certainly not enough to rate it with fewer than 9 stars.This film has everything. There is dramatic tension right from the start. There is a magnificent story arc that picks up quite seamlessly from 'Man of Steel' and propels the viewer not only into the life of Clark Kent/Superman but also of Bruce Wayne/Batman.The villain is no mere cartoon of a villain; he is truly thoroughly (and apparently irrevocably) diabolical. He is a psychopath, and you wish for his death over and over and over. You want Superman to reduce him to ash with the power of his eyes.I have read a number of viewers' reviews, and it seems that the people who disliked the film / gave it a low rating had rather unfair and unrealistic expectations of it. That is, their own prejudices about how the plot could/should unfold or what the character development could/should be, etc. ruined the film for them. And that is a shame.My thought is: I settle into my seat, wait for the lights to dim, and then I wait to be transported by the film. I accept it, lock, stock, and barrel.As another reviewer remarked, I love how the film begins from the point of view of Bruce Wayne as he is among people on the ground who have fallen victim to the attack of Zod and the other Kryptonians.Why would Bruce Wayne not like Superman? Why would the good people of Earth hurl insults at Superman and burn him in effigy (on the news)? Because the good people of Earth just got catapulted into a new reality in which there are not only extraterrestrial beings (surprise!) but they are also superman! And a group of them are hell-bent on destroying humankind and taking the planet for themselves.It is difficult to see Superman as separate from the whole Kryptonian Krew.It seems that many moviegoers forgot that Bruce Wayne is also human. Sure, he's a hero, but he is flawed.. Just like the rest of us. He is a vigilante, after all.He has let his vigilantism get the better of him. HE is actually the one working outside the boundaries of the law, not Superman. It is the clear head of Alfred that shows us that he has gone into a rather dark place, that he has not seen what is really going on (in Luthor's scheme), and so he chooses to embark on his own scheme scheme to take out the alien invader. He is (allegedly) thinking of the future: if he wipes out the all-powerful alien, then it can't turn on humankind in the future. At least, he convinces himself of that.A philosophical question is raised in the film: should Clark Kent have remained a simple man from Kansas and never have become the Superman? Should he just let people die and let calamities happen? The question is answered for us in the character of Diana Prince/Wonder Woman. She withdrew from mankind (her exact words) and just sat around watching. Watching while people died horrible deaths all around her. So, should Superman have done the same? Do these special beings, these 'metahumans', have some kind of moral imperative to intervene, or should they be allowed to be regular people, too? It seems that humans want it both ways.It seems that humans are saying: \"Don't be a superalien ... except when I and my friends and family are in trouble. Then come save us.\""

"Batman v Superman: Ultimate Edition: If your looking for a quick, cheap thrill then you might not enjoy this film at the time. This movies theatrical version was butchered by WB and in doing so reshaped the story leaving numerous plot holes. So the Ultimate Edition is the full story and the one worth seeing. Watch 'Man of Steel' before seeing this movie. There is much to claw through here, so much so that the audience might easily find themselves exhausted from the overall aggression of the film. However, a lot of the story does work. The action is good, and the emotion feels real most of the time.This film is about Superman trying to become Superman. Trying to help the world, save people, find a place in this world not as an outcast, and yet is looked at has a threat by many. Superman is not from this world, yet He is trying to be human, find a place in this world, be excepted by earths people, and come into his destiny.This film is also about Batman being Batman for 20 years and losing faith in humanity, and fearing Superman, what Superman can do with his powers. Great film, great plot, great visuals. ---Yidioo"
"I didn't see the film in the theaters and just bought the \"Extended Edition \" on Amazon. I never properly saw Man of Steel- i think I rented it and watched it when already exhausted and fell asleep. I saw the mediocre user reviews and horrible reviews from critics of this film.They really have it wrong. This is the very best either Batman or Superman. It has a different take, on things. Much darker then earlier films even darker then the Christopher Nolan Batman films.First of all Christopher Nolan is an Executive Producer. So how bad could it be? I loved Sucker Punch and Zack Snyder was involved with that. So how bad could this be? Hans Zimmer did the music, so how bad could it be?I remember watching the old Superman TV shows and reading the Superman and Batman comics as a little kid and loved them, but i wouldn't call myself a \"fan boy\" of comic universes, like so many younger people today. As an older adult I will admit my favorite TV show of all time was Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but watched it on DVD only after it had finished. I saw the second of the Dark Knight series in the theater, but the other two, I watched on DVD. They were great, but not my favorite films like so many people. i also loved the first couple Superman and Batman films in the older series. Regardless, i was not waiting with baited breath to see Man of Steel or this one.I'm more of a serious film fan, who can watch Stanley Kubrick films over and over and my favorite films in the last twenty years, are Eyes Wide Shut and Intersteller, both of which i've watched multiple times.So, with that said, take it from me, the critics have this film very wrong, just as critics hated 2001: A Space Odyssey when it first came out. This film will have lasting appreciation.Surprised how much I liked Ben Afleck's Batman. it was hard to get into Henry Cavil's scrawnier looking Superman, but it grew on me. Amy Adams was great as Lois Lane, The Gal Gadol Wonder Women was amazing. Lex Luther was terrific, like Nolan's Joker. Jeremy Irons was the best Alfred ever. Holly Hunter and Diane Lane was good too. The movie had bad reviews but made a billion dollars. Hopefully everyone buys the Ultimate Edition and it breaks sales records and the film is re-appreciated. I have no idea what scenes this Ultimate Edition added, but it is pretty perfect. Now I can't wait for Wonder Woman and the Justice League and as soon as I finish writing this am going to watch Man of Steal. I'm into it now!I can only surmise that the bad reviews stem from too much expectations of the rigid fan boy types and the radical changes in tone, we see in this film.Total masterpiece of cinema, but I have a few criticisms. There are a few hollow scenes of typical Idiot cops and authorities getting everything wrong in a cliché type way and it has a few filler scenes of that type and a few moments here and there that felt rushed and cheesy. Maybe not everything restored into the Ultimate Edition should have been. I wish there had been more Kevin Costner scenes."

"The whole entire Batman V Superman movie was great and yes even though it felt slow to the majority of the people who watched it but to me I enjoyed every part and every scene of Batman V Superman and when it got to the fight scenes both batman VS Superman and the Doomsday fight it brought so much drama, intensity, and epic performances. So with that being said I give this movie a good 10/10 because it really did go to my expectations and it brought a powerful performance and a powerful yet epic introduction to the upcoming Justice League."

"When I first wrote a review for this movie a year ago exclaiming my excitement for the film, I had been high off a fresh dose of live-action DC superheroes playing out the beloved comic book stories that I had grown up on. It was all playing out before my eyes and coming to life. After a few months had passed, I began to notice things about the movie that I disliked: little gaps in the story, things that didn't add up, etc. My original rating of a 10 / 10 dropped to an 8 /10. But today it has gone back up to a 10. The extended version of the film not only rectifies the gaps but also silences critics.Many claimed that the movie was too dark or that it just didn't make sense. To those people, I say: \"Pick up a comic book!\" Many of the critics of this particular film were part of the superhero bandwagon that formed when Marvel began its spree of Avengers-related films. In fact, its estimated that over 60% of people who go to see 'superhero' genre films have never picked up a comic book in their life. I would argue that similar numbers could figure to those which view the CW televised DC Universe shows. People complain that DC comics is just too dark but the fact is that these movies are based upon actual comics which are meant to be dark (ex: The Dark Knight Returns, Injustice, etc.). Its like complaining that Game of Thrones (the TV series) sucks because they kill off too many characters. Read the books! Its frustrating to see such a beautiful work of art like Batman V Superman criticized by those ignorant to its universe and its meaning. This movie is in fact a catalyst that opens numerous doorways and leaves true fans in awe of the possibilities for future movies. But regardless of whether or not people choose to educate themselves, this film's DVD/Blu-ray extended version puts the theater release to shame. All of the plot holes and gaps are filled in 30 minutes of extended footage scattered throughout the film. The movie ultimately becomes more complete and people will wish that the movie had shown the full 3 hours of footage in its theatrical debut. As a major DC comics fan, I will of course pick up on things that a comics fan would not, but someone who does not read comics would learn to appreciate this film in its entirety with the extended version. Get your hands on a copy today or find it on Netflix or the internet somewhere!"

"I ignored the bad reviews and watched anyways. This film had a lot to live up to after Civil War was released and I went into this film expecting the worst. It ended up to be the best Superhero film of 2016 to me. One complaint was that this film was more concerned about universe building than telling a great story than Civil War but for me it was the other way around; Civil War felt like a build up to something else and to be honest, I felt that way when I saw the other MCU films. Batman vs Superman however not only had a great story, but it also felt a lot more consistent than Civil War. This film was way more diverse with the cast than the MCU but unlike the MCU, I felt like this film doesn't go overboard with the SJW stuff like the MCU films or The Star Wars Sequel films do. The Visuals were AMAZING, The Score by Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL was AMAZING as well, The Tone is just right as I actually felt for the characters emotionally, The Cinematography kept my eyes glued to the screen, and the script felt really Intelligent and Complex and despite people calling the writing confusing, I was able to piece it together with no problem whatsoever. This film is similar to Empire Strikes back in terms of popularity so over time after the other movies are released, this movie would probably be more popular.This film was way better than I Expected and deserves another chance.

"Its shame to see what critics and marvel fans did to this movie and targeted Zack Snyder for it. I have seen this movie more than 25 times till date. And i enjoy this movie as much as i enjoyed the first time. The fans who have read DC comics, wouldn't be disappointed in this movie. Its dark movie, yes it is. Because the title shows the intense situation at hand. Two superheroes about to rip each other apart for whatever reasons that brought them to this stage. Yes it had to be dark and intense.Only marvel can be stupid enough to show an alien invasion where humans are loosing the battle and the super heroes are cracking jokes while battles as if they are playing ping pong. a person playing Call of Duty game is more serious while playing than the marvel heroes fighting aliens."

"Last week some news came out from somebody online who had claimed to have seen a finished version of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. If you were like me, you've been leery of checking it out because you weren't sure how much might actually be true. Now Zack Snyder has spoken out about the spoiler-filled post, although his response doesn't really clear anything up.In a word, to MTV, he called the post \"hilarious,which might imply that he's saying that it's mostly, if not entirely, untrue. That might be the case, but then again he could have just said it was untrue and he didn't say that. What he did say, however, is that he doesn't like spoilers. While this may seem odd for the director who's most recent trailer appeared to give away the entire movie, Snyder says that's not the case. Even if you've seen the trailer, you can rest easy, as there is much more we have not seen in then finished film. Says Snyder I have the benefit of seeing the movie. It's cool that think it's too much, and I appreciate people not wanting to know, but there's plenty that they don't know. There's a lot of movie that's not in the trailer. In the process of calling the Batman v Superman Reddit review hilarious, Snyder goes on to talk about how he hates it when spoilers come out. The director would much rather that fans see the movie mostly blind. While he understands that some fans may wish to find the answers before hand, he wants his movies to be mysteries going in. If you're, as an audience member, exploring these articles, looking for answers to questions that you have, maybe you're okay with knowing before you go. It's like an individual taste. But like I said, I want people to see the movie without knowing.Spoilers are a topic that mean different things to different people. While most try to avoid them to some degree, the need to solve the mystery is a nearly universal human experience. We have an inclination to want to know the truth, even while also wanting to be surprised. For most of us getting some information is good, but getting all the information is bad, of course, only getting the details that you want can be difficult."
"The theatrical is choppy, poorly edited, hard to follow, with some really good moments mixed in their. The extended is much more fluent and is much easier to follow, it does have a long runtime, which might make it seem a bit dragging on, but if you like long films done right, like Lord of the Rings, you will like this movie as long as you get into the characters and story. Speaking of which, the story starts out perfectly showing Bruce Wayne as a character, and it is very powerful. There are several moments in this movie that are powerful, emotional, and shocking. Characters. Batman is my favorite fictional character of all time, and believe me when I say, Ben Affleck as Batman was perfect, he had the charisma, the anger, and the look of being through some bad stuff Gal Gadot also does perfect as Wonder Woman, but if you want to really see how good she does, go watch the Wonder Woman movie. Henry Call as Superman. I really don't like it when people say Christopher Reeves is better. Don't get me wrong, Reeves does great, but can you imagine him as Superman in this movie? I wouldn't like it. It would be like Adam West playing Batman in The Dark Knight. Henry Cavill does great in this role, I can say everything about him as I said with Ben Affleck. Jesse Eisenberg as Luthor. I thought it was different in a good way. I've heard a criticism for him as being too much like Joker, but is that a bad thing? Joker is my favorite villain, so to see Superman have an enemy that crazy, but still hold the values Luthor needs to be Luthor, I think it is great. The thing I thought this movie was lacking in the first and second acts was humor, at least good humor. If there was more humor, I would've given this movie a ten because it would give a more relaxing feel to the parts that needed it. All in all though, this movie was awesome, it had powerful moments, it was badass, and just plain fun. It had a great story arc and does its job very well."

"*I will be talking about the Ultimate Edition of the film* This was one of the most anticipated CBM of all time. Ever since the arrival and subsequent success of Marvel's The Avengers people have wondered when will DC launch its own cinematic universe, one of the main reasons being the opportunity to finally see titans such as Batman and Superman share the screen together: the ultimate nerd dream. On 2016, the moment finally came for BvS to be released AND.. it performed poorly. Not only did critical reception left a lot to be desired, but fan reactions where surprisingly split after its cinematic debut. People either loved it and called Zack a genius, or hated it and called him a hack. Me, personally, I found myself with middle of the road feelings, for sure, but more leaning towards the negative side with subsequent viewings. The theatrical cut of the film showcased amazing performances, incredible visuals, and action set pieces that seemed like comic book panels come to life, in a good way. However, when it comes to its narrative structure and more technical aspects like editing, the film was seriously flawed. More plot holes than Age of Ultron, questionable character decisions, random editing that lacked cohesion and focus, and forced dramatic moments that lacked any impact because the attempts at character development ranged from limited to nonexistent, especially when it comes to Superman's character. I thought it was a 5/10 movie at best. As such, I was kind of skeptical about the idea of a 30 minute longer version. I say kind of because I know how Zack works. I remember Watchmen being vastly improved with its director's cut, so in a way I was expecting BvS to perform in a similar manner, but I also feared those 30 minutes wold be just there to amplify action and discredit storytelling issues. Oh boy, I'm so glad I was proved wrong. The ultimate cut of the film was infuriating, but not because it was awful, but because it questions the sanity of WB executives and editors and makes you wonder what were they thinking during the editing process. What I got out of the Ultimate Edition was a thought-provoking deconstruction of two very iconic superheroes that gave spotlight to the struggles both of them face when they aren't fighting crime. What I got was an extremely well produced character study on both Batman and Superman in a cynical world, a world dangerously close to our own. We meet Batman as a ruthless, worn out hero that has seen the failure behind his ideals and witnessed some truly horrifying things in his life. Superman, on the other hand, is portrayed as a godlike figure that seeks to do good in the world, but finds himself emotionally conflicted once he realized that every good deed he does leaves behind a trail of destruction (most of it due to Luthor's antics). In my opinion, this is a hugely original approach, one that distances itself from the rest of the competition and delivers a dark, somber, yet relevant superhero movie that understands both characters and gives them real human struggles to deal with. I felt invested in both of them, and hoped that by the end of the film both could find a way to redeem themselves. Their character arcs were very well established during the first two acts of the movie, and by the time we get to the titular climactic battle the emotion behind the jaw-dropping action is intensified. Lex Luthor as a villain was also given more time to develop with this new edition. One of the main criticisms with the original version was the fact that his plan relied too much on conveniences, and the character's mannerisms and mad-scientist attitude was annoying, and that goes without saying his motivations were unclear. Not only do we spend more time understanding his hate for any godlike figure and thus his hatred for Superman, but the added scenes allowed us to witness his entire plan come to fruition. It sells the cold, manipulative, calculating attributes of his comic counterpart. The acting is spot on. Every actor owns his/her role, from Cavill's Superman, to Ben Affleck as Batman, Eisenberg as Luthor, and Gadot as Wonder Woman, whose scenes are brief, but are more than enough to sell the strong and ferocious warrior that she is. Cinematography is stunning, and miles above that of Man of Steel's. And the soundtrack by Zimmer and Junkie XL? Perfect, just perfect. When it comes to flaws, the film still has some of those. The Martha moment, while serving as a pivotal character moment for Batman, felt off in execution, and its understandable that many people got mad at it. If your main complaint about BvS the first time around was its bleak tone and subject matter, this film is still not for you. I understand most were expecting to see the heroes being the most iconic versions of themselves, clashing in an elongated battle and evoking the same feelings The Avengers gave audiences back in 2012. In that sense, the film will remain divisive, but at least I have the comfort of saying that, at the very least, the film is competently made."

"This film was amazing. Ben Affleck was easily the best part of this movie, he brought his a-game as Batman. The chemistry between Affleck & Irons was outstanding. Gal Gadot did a great job as Wonder Woman. The fight between Batman & Superman was awesome. The final fight with Doomsday was outstanding in every way possible. However, there is only one problem with this film and that's Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor. He was sadly missed cast in this role, but then again it's really the fault of Warner Bros. Studios. Overall, this film deliver on almost every level. I highly recommend that you watch the extended version of this film."

"I know I know. I saw it in theaters too, and felt like it could've been so much better. While the Batman element was good, the narrative felt fractured, and the third act was just one long stunt scene. Superman was relegated to a supporting character, and other characters didn't get a chance to shine. And then I chanced on the ultimate cut. Calling it 30 mins of \"extra\" footage is unfair to Zack Snyder because it's exactly these 30 mins that makes the movie a worthy one. What I can say about the theatrical cut is this - It had the blockbuster elements - music, visuals, stunts, CGI. But, it lacked the human elements. The first 20 mins of the movie had it, but not after that. The extended cut in comparison has a flow to the narrative. There are no disjointed scenes, everything flows smoothly, and there's connective tissue. Superman gets to spend some time with his father, and mother. Clark Kent does some investigative journalism. Superman helps the people after the blast. Lois Lane doesn't jump to conclusions, she gets to the bottom of the crime. Lex Luthor apparently had a coherent plan - everything is explained pretty well. Wonder Woman was already good, so there's no change there :) Also, the \"Martha\" scene seems better executed, because it is a few seconds longer, and there's time to breathe it in. So, here's my take on this movie - The theatrical cut was junk. Get the Bluray for ultimate edition, and you shall not be disappointed. I've seen it so many more times now, and it's the definitive cut. It is the movie we deserve. It's a unique take on Batman, and Superman. It's a gritty take on the superhero movie genre, and definitely the best DCEU movie, and the best DC movie since The Dark Knight.P.S. Yes it's dark. We're adults, and we should appreciate mature film making without intentionally silly moments. It attempts to be philosophical, and something deep instead of just trying to make you chuckle."

"This is one of the best superhero movies ever made. Zack Snyder is a magician behind the camera.The reason behind so many complaints is the fact that Warner Bros. marketed this movie as a fight between Batman and Superman. That's not what it is. It's a movie about the origins of the Justice League.The cinematography, the acting and the score are all second to none. This film is phenomenal.P.S: watch the 3 hour extended cut that Snyder intended you to see, not the 2 and a half hour movie that Warner Bros. decided would be better for theaters."

"I don't care what the critics say, this is a very well-done movie. I'll start my review by listing what I like about the movie.1.) Ben Affleck is the best batman to me and it is not close. He pulls off the role of an aging batman extremely well. Also, Zack Snyder's vision of batman is legit. I have always hated batman up until this adaptation of him. Instead of being a conflicted and idealistic batman, this batman is dark, gritty, and 100% a badass. His equipment is decked out with machine guns and he has no aversion to killing people. In fact, he probably kills about 50 criminal by the time this movie is over. The warehouse scene is the coolest batman scene in any movie.2.) The development of a grudge between batman and superman is pulled off flawlessly. It actually makes sense why batman dislikes superman. Then, when they do fight it is about the coolest thing you can expect to see from a superhero film. 3.) I disagree with a lot of people about Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor. In my opinion, he played his role to perfection. 4.) B v S sets up Wonder Woman and Justice League with Gal Gadot's cameo as Wonder Woman and short clips of Aquaman, the Flash, and Cyborg. B v S is one of my favorite superhero films and rewatching it never gets old."

"The theatrical cut of this film is garbage which is why I rated it eight stars instead of nine. The first time I watched this film I didn't like it (not straight out hate but didn't like). Character motivations didn't make any sense, Lex was annoying as s***, editing was sloppy, and it was overly dark and broody for an action superhero movie. A year + a half, five Marvel films, a ton of bad reviews and a Justice League later a thought popped into my head: \"what if I watched BVS again\". This time I didn't have trailers ruining the best moments, I only vaguely remembered the film, and I was conditioned to look at it negatively but something unexpected happened: I actually loved it. Superman was just a normal person that tried to make a difference cause he could that others imposed their own beliefs on. Lex Luthor was a genius that couldn't stand his powerlessness compared to Superman or more accurately a super being. As Alfred said \"The fever, the rage, the feeling of powerlessness that turns good men... cruel\" and you see the same thought process in Batman. Batman, just like Lex Luthor feels powerless in the midst of a god-being and just like Lex he attempts to destroy him so he can get his sense of power back but unlike Lex, Batman learns something. I what is one of the corniest lines of the movie Superman says, \"Martha\" when he knows he can't win against Batman in a late desperate attempt to save his mother. Not only does this name connect with Bruce Wayne but it also shows what really matters to a man of steel: it isn't power, it isn't fame or anything else, it is his Mother and on a broader scale it is people. Lex (who doesn't care about people at all) knows he doesn't have the power so he creates something from his blood and the remains of Zod: A Doomsday for Superman. Not only does this film have depth but it also doesn't always explain it to you which is rare in a blockbuster action superhero flick normally cater to semi-comic book fans and people that want to shove popcorn in their mouths. This film rewards you for really noticing the details while still having massive explosions. One of my favorites is how Lex has all of Batman's branded killed which is why he isn't afraid of the branding at the end or Grandma's Peach Tea as a way of scaring the s*** out of someone. Of course, this film isn't perfect and I do have personal dislikes. The Batman V Superman fight was slow and pretty boring especially after watching such an amazing fight in Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 2 (If you haven't watched the animated Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 1 and 2 you are sorely missing out on something fantastic). Also, the addition of Wonder Woman who pretty much steals a hacker thing, gives it back and then suits up and fights against a giant monster thing. Not to say I don't like Wonder Woman (She is one of my favorite Superheroes of all time who showed not only can woman kick a** but they also don't need to be ashamed of their sexuality or gender) but she wasn't really that helpful to the plot and just brought in to expand the universe which was well done through Lex's superhuman hunting files. Also, the post-apocalyptic scene that was just a dream could have been cut but nothing is perfect except movies like Citizen Kane which isn't a lot of fun to watch cause it is too perfect. So to summarize, the theatrical cut is bad, the ultimate cut is Amazing and the other cut is meh. Please give it a second chance because it deserves it and save a good director from losing grace because of something he didn't do."
"I really liked it, don't know what all the hate is about. I'm actually a Marvel fan from when I was 7 or so, but Superman and Batman together in 1 movie? Just great. And personally I like Ben Affleck even better than Christian Bale as Batman. So just watch and enjoy, I know I did!"

"That's right. We have been waiting for these two heroes to finally meet and fight against each other. This movie is so good in both plot and special effects.Henry Cavill and Ben Affleck have performed well in their acting stages. They are the best superhero actors and they have filmed their fighting scenes very well. The movie starts to show the conflict between the lives of the heroes and now they have blamed each other for it. This movie is amazing and sets up a good plot for Dawn Justice."

"Actually...I didn't know what to expect. When you see Wonder Woman, you know it will be off of Wonder Woman and off of a Wonder Woman story, but with Batman V Superman, I was like, \"hmmmm, so who is this about?\" It was pretty obvious that it would feature many characters, but I thought the introduction to Batman was amazing. Ben Affleck nailed the part, not only as Batman but also as Bruce Wayne. He is my Batman. Henry Cavill continued to be super as the Man of Steel. And he is my Super - Man. A dark story? Yes, without a doubt. Could it have had a few more jokes? Sure. But not all movies or stories need to have jokes when certain events are serious. I really hope people can see this review and take another look at the movie, because, I loved it. I really hope the ratings can go up, eventually. And P.S, this movie is the perfect set up to Justice League."

"I'll start by making it clear I have only ever seen the Ultimate Edition. I'm aware of what was cut out for the theatrical release, so I will concede up front that most of the criticisms about pacing, editing, and missing bits of plot at release were merited.With that caveat out of the way, I must reiterate that this was bar-none the boldest superhero movie I have ever seen. To me, it was arguably the best as well, though \"best\" shouldn't be taken to mean \"most enjoyable.\" That honor easily goes to \"Thor: Ragnarok.\" What makes BvS stand out among other films in the genre is that it takes two characters who have been done to death since the 1970s and brings them up to date. I recently tried to watch \"Superman: The Movie\" for the first time in a number of years, and while it was still good and Reeves will always be iconic, I just couldn't take it seriously. I'll put it this way: If the story in BvS was \"stupid\" in your view but Superman turning back time by spinning the earth backward on its axis didn't seem like one of the dumbest things you have ever seen -in any movie from any genre- to the extent that it outright ruins the movie for you, then your opinion about BvS isn't worth much. Nostalgic bias was always going to be a problem for this movie, and the way people reacted to and reviewed \"Man of Steel\" was telling in this regard.That brings me to Zack Snyder's take on Superman. You know, that guy whose status as the first extraterrestrial ever encountered by humanity was a total non-issue in the old movies. Apparently, Snyder has a similar view to my own in that his take on the Man of Steel makes his being an alien a core piece of his identity. He may look like any other (absurdly attractive) person, but he knows what he is, and that makes him perpetually uncertain of where he fits in this world. He is essentially good and really does care about people, but he struggles to truly empathize with the likes of us. To be human is to be frail, and that is not something he can easily relate to. This is the root of his conflict with Batman.Just as Clark struggles to genuinely relate to most people, Snyder's Batman either refuses to or otherwise just can't relate to Superman. He doesn't see him as anything but a threat regardless of Superman's clear good intentions. Remember, a small group of Kryptonians were able to bring humanity to the brink of extinction in less than a day, and Bruce Wayne is nothing if not a realist. He didn't know the guy from Kansas. He only knew the god from another world.While Batman's anger toward and fear of Superman are readily apparent from the start, Superman's inability to imagine things from Bruce Wayne's perspective only becomes truly apparent during their first real interaction. This reminded me of the animated version of the \"world's finest\" storyline, where Superman judges Batman harshly for using fear tactics and threats of violence (also, actual violence) to get the job done. Superman wasn't willing to consider what it would take for a human man to fight criminals and save innocents, or what that life would do to him over time. Just as Batman didn't see the guy from Kansas, Superman didn't see the man who lives his life trapped in one brutal, unthinkably traumatic moment (this was beautifully conveyed during the film's opening moments), and had spent his whole adult life bearing witness to humanity at its absolute worst.The conflict between these two characters is as old as human history. They want the same things, but they can't understand one another. So they fight. And what a fight it was.Watching a fight between, say, Captain America and Iron Man was, to me, more frustrating than anything because each understood the other's perspective perfectly. The fight between Batman and Superman in BvS was genuinely gut-wrenching, as intended, because they would have understood one another if either had tried. The whole sequence hilighted Batman's tactical prowess and ability to control a situation. Maybe the most badass thing about the fight was that it ended exactly where Batman planned. That brings me to the big elephant in the room named \"Martha.\"I can't recall exactly which YouTuber put it this way, but if you thought the \"save Martha\" exchange was about their mothers having the same name, you had your brain turned off. The brain-on people have explained this to death, but it bears repeating. This was the moment when Superman became humanized to Batman. He was about to die, and his only concern was for his adoptive human mother. He still believed that the man about to take his life would do the right thing. Even with the cowl on, there was no mistaking the look on Batman's face. It was the look of shame, guilt, and sudden uncertainty that says \"What am I doing?\" Turns out even the most brutal, angry version of Bruce Wayne is better than Tony Stark at knowing right from wrong. At knowing that he had gone too far.From there, the third act was a series of truly impressive (albeit mostly CGI) fight sequences, beginning with what I regard as the undisputed champion of Batman fights. Nothing in the Nolan movies (and especially nothing in the Burton movies) even came close. Go ahead, try to convince yourself that Batman and Bane taking turns punching one another in the face until Bane's mask broke was a good fight sequence. No, this was a fight straight out of \"Arkham Knight,\" and it was glorious. The battle against Doomsday really was one for the books. From the moment Wonder Woman arrived accompanied by the intense sounds of Tina Guo's electric cello to Superman's tragic, heroic death at the hands of Doomsday, I was glued to the screen. Sure, the mere presence of Doomsday spoiled the end to a degree, but watching the Man of Steel laboring to carry that kryptonite spear towards certain death was no less impactful. A brief word on Jesse Eisenberg's take on Lex Luthor. At least one other reviewer on this site already said it best when they pointed out that this was his origin story. If you consider his scheme objectively, he is actually one of the more formidable incarnations of the character. If we're lucky, we'll eventually get to see a Snyder Cut of \"Justice League\" and find out where this story was actually meant to go. For the record, Joss Whedon and Danny Elfman both should have said \"no\" to taking a dump on someone else's art."
"BATMAN V SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE brings a fantastic surprise to a smash-hit team-up with one of the worlds most beloved DC Comics' icons of all time. The movie delivers spectacular casting, and fantastic acting with different characters having their shine in each scenes.The story follows Clark Kent/Superman who becomes a threat, after the destruction in Metropolis in Man Of Steel.(2013). Batman/Bruce Wayne sees him as a threat and begins his war on Superman.The movie brings spectacular storytelling, it tells the complications of human against alien who are on the same side, and the first meeting of Batman and Superman. The story of Bruce Wayne, with his many years of The Caped Crusader, sends him on a spiral of \"out of control\", sheer anger, and builds tension to wanting to defeat the Man of Steel. Snyder has fantastically gave this storytelling an exciting nod to the comics.Lex Luthor, played by Jesse Einsberg, delivers a very interesting performance, but very differently by him showing is his \"origin\" before he becomes a bald foe to the Man of Steel. He shows that his love of \"god vs man\" terrorises mankind when he ultimately creates Doomsday, and Batman realises Superman's inner heroism.It packs so many great \"out of nowhere\" excitement, including a first-look of the fearful Wonder Woman a.k.a. Diana Prince, played by Gal Gadot, and a fresh-new glimpse of the superhero DC canon: The Justice League.WATCH THIS MOVIE! The critics are out of their mind. It's a fun-packed action adventure which still keeps the movie enjoyable until it's final minutes of the movie. It's a FANTASTIC MOVIE! BEN AFFLECK AS BATMAN... is Incredible!A 10/10 overall!"
"I want to go on record as saying that this is a truly thrilling cinematic experience in so many ways. If pressed, I guess I could acknowledge that there were a couple ... let's say \"clumsy\" moments. And in a film that runs to three hours, that hardly seems like a significant issue, certainly not enough to rate it with fewer than 9 stars.This film has everything. There is dramatic tension right from the start. There is a magnificent story arc that picks up quite seamlessly from 'Man of Steel' and propels the viewer not only into the life of Clark Kent/Superman but also of Bruce Wayne/Batman.The villain is no mere cartoon of a villain; he is truly thoroughly (and apparently irrevocably) diabolical. He is a psychopath, and you wish for his death over and over and over. You want Superman to reduce him to ash with the power of his eyes.I have read a number of viewers' reviews, and it seems that the people who disliked the film / gave it a low rating had rather unfair and unrealistic expectations of it. That is, their own prejudices about how the plot could/should unfold or what the character development could/should be, etc. ruined the film for them. And that is a shame.My thought is: I settle into my seat, wait for the lights to dim, and then I wait to be transported by the film. I accept it, lock, stock, and barrel.As another reviewer remarked, I love how the film begins from the point of view of Bruce Wayne as he is among people on the ground who have fallen victim to the attack of Zod and the other Kryptonians.Why would Bruce Wayne not like Superman? Why would the good people of Earth hurl insults at Superman and burn him in effigy (on the news)? Because the good people of Earth just got catapulted into a new reality in which there are not only extraterrestrial beings (surprise!) but they are also superman! And a group of them are hell-bent on destroying humankind and taking the planet for themselves.It is difficult to see Superman as separate from the whole Kryptonian Krew.It seems that many moviegoers forgot that Bruce Wayne is also human. Sure, he's a hero, but he is flawed.. Just like the rest of us. He is a vigilante, after all.He has let his vigilantism get the better of him. HE is actually the one working outside the boundaries of the law, not Superman. It is the clear head of Alfred that shows us that he has gone into a rather dark place, that he has not seen what is really going on (in Luthor's scheme), and so he chooses to embark on his own scheme scheme to take out the alien invader. He is (allegedly) thinking of the future: if he wipes out the all-powerful alien, then it can't turn on humankind in the future. At least, he convinces himself of that.A philosophical question is raised in the film: should Clark Kent have remained a simple man from Kansas and never have become the Superman? Should he just let people die and let calamities happen? The question is answered for us in the character of Diana Prince/Wonder Woman. She withdrew from mankind (her exact words) and just sat around watching. Watching while people died horrible deaths all around her. So, should Superman have done the same? Do these special beings, these 'metahumans', have some kind of moral imperative to intervene, or should they be allowed to be regular people, too? It seems that humans want it both ways.It seems that humans are saying: \"Don't be a superalien ... except when I and my friends and family are in trouble. Then come save us.\""

"Batman v Superman: Ultimate Edition: If your looking for a quick, cheap thrill then you might not enjoy this film at the time. This movies theatrical version was butchered by WB and in doing so reshaped the story leaving numerous plot holes. So the Ultimate Edition is the full story and the one worth seeing. Watch 'Man of Steel' before seeing this movie. There is much to claw through here, so much so that the audience might easily find themselves exhausted from the overall aggression of the film. However, a lot of the story does work. The action is good, and the emotion feels real most of the time.This film is about Superman trying to become Superman. Trying to help the world, save people, find a place in this world not as an outcast, and yet is looked at has a threat by many. Superman is not from this world, yet He is trying to be human, find a place in this world, be excepted by earths people, and come into his destiny.This film is also about Batman being Batman for 20 years and losing faith in humanity, and fearing Superman, what Superman can do with his powers. Great film, great plot, great visuals. ---Yidioo"
"I didn't see the film in the theaters and just bought the \"Extended Edition \" on Amazon. I never properly saw Man of Steel- i think I rented it and watched it when already exhausted and fell asleep. I saw the mediocre user reviews and horrible reviews from critics of this film.They really have it wrong. This is the very best either Batman or Superman. It has a different take, on things. Much darker then earlier films even darker then the Christopher Nolan Batman films.First of all Christopher Nolan is an Executive Producer. So how bad could it be? I loved Sucker Punch and Zack Snyder was involved with that. So how bad could this be? Hans Zimmer did the music, so how bad could it be?I remember watching the old Superman TV shows and reading the Superman and Batman comics as a little kid and loved them, but i wouldn't call myself a \"fan boy\" of comic universes, like so many younger people today. As an older adult I will admit my favorite TV show of all time was Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but watched it on DVD only after it had finished. I saw the second of the Dark Knight series in the theater, but the other two, I watched on DVD. They were great, but not my favorite films like so many people. i also loved the first couple Superman and Batman films in the older series. Regardless, i was not waiting with baited breath to see Man of Steel or this one.I'm more of a serious film fan, who can watch Stanley Kubrick films over and over and my favorite films in the last twenty years, are Eyes Wide Shut and Intersteller, both of which i've watched multiple times.So, with that said, take it from me, the critics have this film very wrong, just as critics hated 2001: A Space Odyssey when it first came out. This film will have lasting appreciation.Surprised how much I liked Ben Afleck's Batman. it was hard to get into Henry Cavil's scrawnier looking Superman, but it grew on me. Amy Adams was great as Lois Lane, The Gal Gadol Wonder Women was amazing. Lex Luther was terrific, like Nolan's Joker. Jeremy Irons was the best Alfred ever. Holly Hunter and Diane Lane was good too. The movie had bad reviews but made a billion dollars. Hopefully everyone buys the Ultimate Edition and it breaks sales records and the film is re-appreciated. I have no idea what scenes this Ultimate Edition added, but it is pretty perfect. Now I can't wait for Wonder Woman and the Justice League and as soon as I finish writing this am going to watch Man of Steal. I'm into it now!I can only surmise that the bad reviews stem from too much expectations of the rigid fan boy types and the radical changes in tone, we see in this film.Total masterpiece of cinema, but I have a few criticisms. There are a few hollow scenes of typical Idiot cops and authorities getting everything wrong in a cliché type way and it has a few filler scenes of that type and a few moments here and there that felt rushed and cheesy. Maybe not everything restored into the Ultimate Edition should have been. I wish there had been more Kevin Costner scenes."

"The whole entire Batman V Superman movie was great and yes even though it felt slow to the majority of the people who watched it but to me I enjoyed every part and every scene of Batman V Superman and when it got to the fight scenes both batman VS Superman and the Doomsday fight it brought so much drama, intensity, and epic performances. So with that being said I give this movie a good 10/10 because it really did go to my expectations and it brought a powerful performance and a powerful yet epic introduction to the upcoming Justice League."

"Zack Snyder not only understands the characters but he also understands how to craft a real amazing movie for fans - honestly blew me away (extended cut) Brilliant!Don't believe what the internet is telling you to think - take this from a person who has worked in the comic book industry - this is amazing!"

"When I first wrote a review for this movie a year ago exclaiming my excitement for the film, I had been high off a fresh dose of live-action DC superheroes playing out the beloved comic book stories that I had grown up on. It was all playing out before my eyes and coming to life. After a few months had passed, I began to notice things about the movie that I disliked: little gaps in the story, things that didn't add up, etc. My original rating of a 10 / 10 dropped to an 8 /10. But today it has gone back up to a 10. The extended version of the film not only rectifies the gaps but also silences critics.Many claimed that the movie was too dark or that it just didn't make sense. To those people, I say: \"Pick up a comic book!\" Many of the critics of this particular film were part of the superhero bandwagon that formed when Marvel began its spree of Avengers-related films. In fact, its estimated that over 60% of people who go to see 'superhero' genre films have never picked up a comic book in their life. I would argue that similar numbers could figure to those which view the CW televised DC Universe shows. People complain that DC comics is just too dark but the fact is that these movies are based upon actual comics which are meant to be dark (ex: The Dark Knight Returns, Injustice, etc.). Its like complaining that Game of Thrones (the TV series) sucks because they kill off too many characters. Read the books! Its frustrating to see such a beautiful work of art like Batman V Superman criticized by those ignorant to its universe and its meaning. This movie is in fact a catalyst that opens numerous doorways and leaves true fans in awe of the possibilities for future movies. But regardless of whether or not people choose to educate themselves, this film's DVD/Blu-ray extended version puts the theater release to shame. All of the plot holes and gaps are filled in 30 minutes of extended footage scattered throughout the film. The movie ultimately becomes more complete and people will wish that the movie had shown the full 3 hours of footage in its theatrical debut. As a major DC comics fan, I will of course pick up on things that a comics fan would not, but someone who does not read comics would learn to appreciate this film in its entirety with the extended version. Get your hands on a copy today or find it on Netflix or the internet somewhere!"

"I ignored the bad reviews and watched anyways. This film had a lot to live up to after Civil War was released and I went into this film expecting the worst. It ended up to be the best Superhero film of 2016 to me. One complaint was that this film was more concerned about universe building than telling a great story than Civil War but for me it was the other way around; Civil War felt like a build up to something else and to be honest, I felt that way when I saw the other MCU films. Batman vs Superman however not only had a great story, but it also felt a lot more consistent than Civil War. This film was way more diverse with the cast than the MCU but unlike the MCU, I felt like this film doesn't go overboard with the SJW stuff like the MCU films or The Star Wars Sequel films do. The Visuals were AMAZING, The Score by Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL was AMAZING as well, The Tone is just right as I actually felt for the characters emotionally, The Cinematography kept my eyes glued to the screen, and the script felt really Intelligent and Complex and despite people calling the writing confusing, I was able to piece it together with no problem whatsoever. This film is similar to Empire Strikes back in terms of popularity so over time after the other movies are released, this movie would probably be more popular.This film was way better than I Expected and deserves another chance.

"Its shame to see what critics and marvel fans did to this movie and targeted Zack Snyder for it. I have seen this movie more than 25 times till date. And i enjoy this movie as much as i enjoyed the first time. The fans who have read DC comics, wouldn't be disappointed in this movie. Its dark movie, yes it is. Because the title shows the intense situation at hand. Two superheroes about to rip each other apart for whatever reasons that brought them to this stage. Yes it had to be dark and intense.Only marvel can be stupid enough to show an alien invasion where humans are loosing the battle and the super heroes are cracking jokes while battles as if they are playing ping pong. a person playing Call of Duty game is more serious while playing than the marvel heroes fighting aliens."

"Last week some news came out from somebody online who had claimed to have seen a finished version of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. If you were like me, you've been leery of checking it out because you weren't sure how much might actually be true. Now Zack Snyder has spoken out about the spoiler-filled post, although his response doesn't really clear anything up.In a word, to MTV, he called the post \"hilarious,which might imply that he's saying that it's mostly, if not entirely, untrue. That might be the case, but then again he could have just said it was untrue and he didn't say that. What he did say, however, is that he doesn't like spoilers. While this may seem odd for the director who's most recent trailer appeared to give away the entire movie, Snyder says that's not the case. Even if you've seen the trailer, you can rest easy, as there is much more we have not seen in then finished film. Says Snyder I have the benefit of seeing the movie. It's cool that think it's too much, and I appreciate people not wanting to know, but there's plenty that they don't know. There's a lot of movie that's not in the trailer. In the process of calling the Batman v Superman Reddit review hilarious, Snyder goes on to talk about how he hates it when spoilers come out. The director would much rather that fans see the movie mostly blind. While he understands that some fans may wish to find the answers before hand, he wants his movies to be mysteries going in. If you're, as an audience member, exploring these articles, looking for answers to questions that you have, maybe you're okay with knowing before you go. It's like an individual taste. But like I said, I want people to see the movie without knowing.Spoilers are a topic that mean different things to different people. While most try to avoid them to some degree, the need to solve the mystery is a nearly universal human experience. We have an inclination to want to know the truth, even while also wanting to be surprised. For most of us getting some information is good, but getting all the information is bad, of course, only getting the details that you want can be difficult."
"The theatrical is choppy, poorly edited, hard to follow, with some really good moments mixed in their. The extended is much more fluent and is much easier to follow, it does have a long runtime, which might make it seem a bit dragging on, but if you like long films done right, like Lord of the Rings, you will like this movie as long as you get into the characters and story. Speaking of which, the story starts out perfectly showing Bruce Wayne as a character, and it is very powerful. There are several moments in this movie that are powerful, emotional, and shocking. Characters. Batman is my favorite fictional character of all time, and believe me when I say, Ben Affleck as Batman was perfect, he had the charisma, the anger, and the look of being through some bad stuff Gal Gadot also does perfect as Wonder Woman, but if you want to really see how good she does, go watch the Wonder Woman movie. Henry Call as Superman. I really don't like it when people say Christopher Reeves is better. Don't get me wrong, Reeves does great, but can you imagine him as Superman in this movie? I wouldn't like it. It would be like Adam West playing Batman in The Dark Knight. Henry Cavill does great in this role, I can say everything about him as I said with Ben Affleck. Jesse Eisenberg as Luthor. I thought it was different in a good way. I've heard a criticism for him as being too much like Joker, but is that a bad thing? Joker is my favorite villain, so to see Superman have an enemy that crazy, but still hold the values Luthor needs to be Luthor, I think it is great. The thing I thought this movie was lacking in the first and second acts was humor, at least good humor. If there was more humor, I would've given this movie a ten because it would give a more relaxing feel to the parts that needed it. All in all though, this movie was awesome, it had powerful moments, it was badass, and just plain fun. It had a great story arc and does its job very well."

"*I will be talking about the Ultimate Edition of the film* This was one of the most anticipated CBM of all time. Ever since the arrival and subsequent success of Marvel's The Avengers people have wondered when will DC launch its own cinematic universe, one of the main reasons being the opportunity to finally see titans such as Batman and Superman share the screen together: the ultimate nerd dream. On 2016, the moment finally came for BvS to be released AND.. it performed poorly. Not only did critical reception left a lot to be desired, but fan reactions where surprisingly split after its cinematic debut. People either loved it and called Zack a genius, or hated it and called him a hack. Me, personally, I found myself with middle of the road feelings, for sure, but more leaning towards the negative side with subsequent viewings. The theatrical cut of the film showcased amazing performances, incredible visuals, and action set pieces that seemed like comic book panels come to life, in a good way. However, when it comes to its narrative structure and more technical aspects like editing, the film was seriously flawed. More plot holes than Age of Ultron, questionable character decisions, random editing that lacked cohesion and focus, and forced dramatic moments that lacked any impact because the attempts at character development ranged from limited to nonexistent, especially when it comes to Superman's character. I thought it was a 5/10 movie at best. As such, I was kind of skeptical about the idea of a 30 minute longer version. I say kind of because I know how Zack works. I remember Watchmen being vastly improved with its director's cut, so in a way I was expecting BvS to perform in a similar manner, but I also feared those 30 minutes wold be just there to amplify action and discredit storytelling issues. Oh boy, I'm so glad I was proved wrong. The ultimate cut of the film was infuriating, but not because it was awful, but because it questions the sanity of WB executives and editors and makes you wonder what were they thinking during the editing process. What I got out of the Ultimate Edition was a thought-provoking deconstruction of two very iconic superheroes that gave spotlight to the struggles both of them face when they aren't fighting crime. What I got was an extremely well produced character study on both Batman and Superman in a cynical world, a world dangerously close to our own. We meet Batman as a ruthless, worn out hero that has seen the failure behind his ideals and witnessed some truly horrifying things in his life. Superman, on the other hand, is portrayed as a godlike figure that seeks to do good in the world, but finds himself emotionally conflicted once he realized that every good deed he does leaves behind a trail of destruction (most of it due to Luthor's antics). In my opinion, this is a hugely original approach, one that distances itself from the rest of the competition and delivers a dark, somber, yet relevant superhero movie that understands both characters and gives them real human struggles to deal with. I felt invested in both of them, and hoped that by the end of the film both could find a way to redeem themselves. Their character arcs were very well established during the first two acts of the movie, and by the time we get to the titular climactic battle the emotion behind the jaw-dropping action is intensified. Lex Luthor as a villain was also given more time to develop with this new edition. One of the main criticisms with the original version was the fact that his plan relied too much on conveniences, and the character's mannerisms and mad-scientist attitude was annoying, and that goes without saying his motivations were unclear. Not only do we spend more time understanding his hate for any godlike figure and thus his hatred for Superman, but the added scenes allowed us to witness his entire plan come to fruition. It sells the cold, manipulative, calculating attributes of his comic counterpart. The acting is spot on. Every actor owns his/her role, from Cavill's Superman, to Ben Affleck as Batman, Eisenberg as Luthor, and Gadot as Wonder Woman, whose scenes are brief, but are more than enough to sell the strong and ferocious warrior that she is. Cinematography is stunning, and miles above that of Man of Steel's. And the soundtrack by Zimmer and Junkie XL? Perfect, just perfect. When it comes to flaws, the film still has some of those. The Martha moment, while serving as a pivotal character moment for Batman, felt off in execution, and its understandable that many people got mad at it. If your main complaint about BvS the first time around was its bleak tone and subject matter, this film is still not for you. I understand most were expecting to see the heroes being the most iconic versions of themselves, clashing in an elongated battle and evoking the same feelings The Avengers gave audiences back in 2012. In that sense, the film will remain divisive, but at least I have the comfort of saying that, at the very least, the film is competently made."

"This film was amazing. Ben Affleck was easily the best part of this movie, he brought his a-game as Batman. The chemistry between Affleck & Irons was outstanding. Gal Gadot did a great job as Wonder Woman. The fight between Batman & Superman was awesome. The final fight with Doomsday was outstanding in every way possible. However, there is only one problem with this film and that's Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor. He was sadly missed cast in this role, but then again it's really the fault of Warner Bros. Studios. Overall, this film deliver on almost every level. I highly recommend that you watch the extended version of this film."

"I know I know. I saw it in theaters too, and felt like it could've been so much better. While the Batman element was good, the narrative felt fractured, and the third act was just one long stunt scene. Superman was relegated to a supporting character, and other characters didn't get a chance to shine. And then I chanced on the ultimate cut. Calling it 30 mins of \"extra\" footage is unfair to Zack Snyder because it's exactly these 30 mins that makes the movie a worthy one. What I can say about the theatrical cut is this - It had the blockbuster elements - music, visuals, stunts, CGI. But, it lacked the human elements. The first 20 mins of the movie had it, but not after that. The extended cut in comparison has a flow to the narrative. There are no disjointed scenes, everything flows smoothly, and there's connective tissue. Superman gets to spend some time with his father, and mother. Clark Kent does some investigative journalism. Superman helps the people after the blast. Lois Lane doesn't jump to conclusions, she gets to the bottom of the crime. Lex Luthor apparently had a coherent plan - everything is explained pretty well. Wonder Woman was already good, so there's no change there :) Also, the \"Martha\" scene seems better executed, because it is a few seconds longer, and there's time to breathe it in. So, here's my take on this movie - The theatrical cut was junk. Get the Bluray for ultimate edition, and you shall not be disappointed. I've seen it so many more times now, and it's the definitive cut. It is the movie we deserve. It's a unique take on Batman, and Superman. It's a gritty take on the superhero movie genre, and definitely the best DCEU movie, and the best DC movie since The Dark Knight.P.S. Yes it's dark. We're adults, and we should appreciate mature film making without intentionally silly moments. It attempts to be philosophical, and something deep instead of just trying to make you chuckle."

"This is one of the best superhero movies ever made. Zack Snyder is a magician behind the camera.The reason behind so many complaints is the fact that Warner Bros. marketed this movie as a fight between Batman and Superman. That's not what it is. It's a movie about the origins of the Justice League.The cinematography, the acting and the score are all second to none. This film is phenomenal.P.S: watch the 3 hour extended cut that Snyder intended you to see, not the 2 and a half hour movie that Warner Bros. decided would be better for theaters."

"I don't care what the critics say, this is a very well-done movie. I'll start my review by listing what I like about the movie.1.) Ben Affleck is the best batman to me and it is not close. He pulls off the role of an aging batman extremely well. Also, Zack Snyder's vision of batman is legit. I have always hated batman up until this adaptation of him. Instead of being a conflicted and idealistic batman, this batman is dark, gritty, and 100% a badass. His equipment is decked out with machine guns and he has no aversion to killing people. In fact, he probably kills about 50 criminal by the time this movie is over. The warehouse scene is the coolest batman scene in any movie.2.) The development of a grudge between batman and superman is pulled off flawlessly. It actually makes sense why batman dislikes superman. Then, when they do fight it is about the coolest thing you can expect to see from a superhero film. 3.) I disagree with a lot of people about Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor. In my opinion, he played his role to perfection. 4.) B v S sets up Wonder Woman and Justice League with Gal Gadot's cameo as Wonder Woman and short clips of Aquaman, the Flash, and Cyborg. B v S is one of my favorite superhero films and rewatching it never gets old."

"The theatrical cut of this film is garbage which is why I rated it eight stars instead of nine. The first time I watched this film I didn't like it (not straight out hate but didn't like). Character motivations didn't make any sense, Lex was annoying as s***, editing was sloppy, and it was overly dark and broody for an action superhero movie. A year + a half, five Marvel films, a ton of bad reviews and a Justice League later a thought popped into my head: \"what if I watched BVS again\". This time I didn't have trailers ruining the best moments, I only vaguely remembered the film, and I was conditioned to look at it negatively but something unexpected happened: I actually loved it. Superman was just a normal person that tried to make a difference cause he could that others imposed their own beliefs on. Lex Luthor was a genius that couldn't stand his powerlessness compared to Superman or more accurately a super being. As Alfred said \"The fever, the rage, the feeling of powerlessness that turns good men... cruel\" and you see the same thought process in Batman. Batman, just like Lex Luthor feels powerless in the midst of a god-being and just like Lex he attempts to destroy him so he can get his sense of power back but unlike Lex, Batman learns something. I what is one of the corniest lines of the movie Superman says, \"Martha\" when he knows he can't win against Batman in a late desperate attempt to save his mother. Not only does this name connect with Bruce Wayne but it also shows what really matters to a man of steel: it isn't power, it isn't fame or anything else, it is his Mother and on a broader scale it is people. Lex (who doesn't care about people at all) knows he doesn't have the power so he creates something from his blood and the remains of Zod: A Doomsday for Superman. Not only does this film have depth but it also doesn't always explain it to you which is rare in a blockbuster action superhero flick normally cater to semi-comic book fans and people that want to shove popcorn in their mouths. This film rewards you for really noticing the details while still having massive explosions. One of my favorites is how Lex has all of Batman's branded killed which is why he isn't afraid of the branding at the end or Grandma's Peach Tea as a way of scaring the s*** out of someone. Of course, this film isn't perfect and I do have personal dislikes. The Batman V Superman fight was slow and pretty boring especially after watching such an amazing fight in Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 2 (If you haven't watched the animated Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 1 and 2 you are sorely missing out on something fantastic). Also, the addition of Wonder Woman who pretty much steals a hacker thing, gives it back and then suits up and fights against a giant monster thing. Not to say I don't like Wonder Woman (She is one of my favorite Superheroes of all time who showed not only can woman kick a** but they also don't need to be ashamed of their sexuality or gender) but she wasn't really that helpful to the plot and just brought in to expand the universe which was well done through Lex's superhuman hunting files. Also, the post-apocalyptic scene that was just a dream could have been cut but nothing is perfect except movies like Citizen Kane which isn't a lot of fun to watch cause it is too perfect. So to summarize, the theatrical cut is bad, the ultimate cut is Amazing and the other cut is meh. Please give it a second chance because it deserves it and save a good director from losing grace because of something he didn't do."
"I really liked it, don't know what all the hate is about. I'm actually a Marvel fan from when I was 7 or so, but Superman and Batman together in 1 movie? Just great. And personally I like Ben Affleck even better than Christian Bale as Batman. So just watch and enjoy, I know I did!"

"That's right. We have been waiting for these two heroes to finally meet and fight against each other. This movie is so good in both plot and special effects.Henry Cavill and Ben Affleck have performed well in their acting stages. They are the best superhero actors and they have filmed their fighting scenes very well. The movie starts to show the conflict between the lives of the heroes and now they have blamed each other for it. This movie is amazing and sets up a good plot for Dawn Justice."

"Actually...I didn't know what to expect. When you see Wonder Woman, you know it will be off of Wonder Woman and off of a Wonder Woman story, but with Batman V Superman, I was like, \"hmmmm, so who is this about?\" It was pretty obvious that it would feature many characters, but I thought the introduction to Batman was amazing. Ben Affleck nailed the part, not only as Batman but also as Bruce Wayne. He is my Batman. Henry Cavill continued to be super as the Man of Steel. And he is my Super - Man. A dark story? Yes, without a doubt. Could it have had a few more jokes? Sure. But not all movies or stories need to have jokes when certain events are serious. I really hope people can see this review and take another look at the movie, because, I loved it. I really hope the ratings can go up, eventually. And P.S, this movie is the perfect set up to Justice League."

"I'll start by making it clear I have only ever seen the Ultimate Edition. I'm aware of what was cut out for the theatrical release, so I will concede up front that most of the criticisms about pacing, editing, and missing bits of plot at release were merited.With that caveat out of the way, I must reiterate that this was bar-none the boldest superhero movie I have ever seen. To me, it was arguably the best as well, though \"best\" shouldn't be taken to mean \"most enjoyable.\" That honor easily goes to \"Thor: Ragnarok.\" What makes BvS stand out among other films in the genre is that it takes two characters who have been done to death since the 1970s and brings them up to date. I recently tried to watch \"Superman: The Movie\" for the first time in a number of years, and while it was still good and Reeves will always be iconic, I just couldn't take it seriously. I'll put it this way: If the story in BvS was \"stupid\" in your view but Superman turning back time by spinning the earth backward on its axis didn't seem like one of the dumbest things you have ever seen -in any movie from any genre- to the extent that it outright ruins the movie for you, then your opinion about BvS isn't worth much. Nostalgic bias was always going to be a problem for this movie, and the way people reacted to and reviewed \"Man of Steel\" was telling in this regard.That brings me to Zack Snyder's take on Superman. You know, that guy whose status as the first extraterrestrial ever encountered by humanity was a total non-issue in the old movies. Apparently, Snyder has a similar view to my own in that his take on the Man of Steel makes his being an alien a core piece of his identity. He may look like any other (absurdly attractive) person, but he knows what he is, and that makes him perpetually uncertain of where he fits in this world. He is essentially good and really does care about people, but he struggles to truly empathize with the likes of us. To be human is to be frail, and that is not something he can easily relate to. This is the root of his conflict with Batman.Just as Clark struggles to genuinely relate to most people, Snyder's Batman either refuses to or otherwise just can't relate to Superman. He doesn't see him as anything but a threat regardless of Superman's clear good intentions. Remember, a small group of Kryptonians were able to bring humanity to the brink of extinction in less than a day, and Bruce Wayne is nothing if not a realist. He didn't know the guy from Kansas. He only knew the god from another world.While Batman's anger toward and fear of Superman are readily apparent from the start, Superman's inability to imagine things from Bruce Wayne's perspective only becomes truly apparent during their first real interaction. This reminded me of the animated version of the \"world's finest\" storyline, where Superman judges Batman harshly for using fear tactics and threats of violence (also, actual violence) to get the job done. Superman wasn't willing to consider what it would take for a human man to fight criminals and save innocents, or what that life would do to him over time. Just as Batman didn't see the guy from Kansas, Superman didn't see the man who lives his life trapped in one brutal, unthinkably traumatic moment (this was beautifully conveyed during the film's opening moments), and had spent his whole adult life bearing witness to humanity at its absolute worst.The conflict between these two characters is as old as human history. They want the same things, but they can't understand one another. So they fight. And what a fight it was.Watching a fight between, say, Captain America and Iron Man was, to me, more frustrating than anything because each understood the other's perspective perfectly. The fight between Batman and Superman in BvS was genuinely gut-wrenching, as intended, because they would have understood one another if either had tried. The whole sequence hilighted Batman's tactical prowess and ability to control a situation. Maybe the most badass thing about the fight was that it ended exactly where Batman planned. That brings me to the big elephant in the room named \"Martha.\"I can't recall exactly which YouTuber put it this way, but if you thought the \"save Martha\" exchange was about their mothers having the same name, you had your brain turned off. The brain-on people have explained this to death, but it bears repeating. This was the moment when Superman became humanized to Batman. He was about to die, and his only concern was for his adoptive human mother. He still believed that the man about to take his life would do the right thing. Even with the cowl on, there was no mistaking the look on Batman's face. It was the look of shame, guilt, and sudden uncertainty that says \"What am I doing?\" Turns out even the most brutal, angry version of Bruce Wayne is better than Tony Stark at knowing right from wrong. At knowing that he had gone too far.From there, the third act was a series of truly impressive (albeit mostly CGI) fight sequences, beginning with what I regard as the undisputed champion of Batman fights. Nothing in the Nolan movies (and especially nothing in the Burton movies) even came close. Go ahead, try to convince yourself that Batman and Bane taking turns punching one another in the face until Bane's mask broke was a good fight sequence. No, this was a fight straight out of \"Arkham Knight,\" and it was glorious. The battle against Doomsday really was one for the books. From the moment Wonder Woman arrived accompanied by the intense sounds of Tina Guo's electric cello to Superman's tragic, heroic death at the hands of Doomsday, I was glued to the screen. Sure, the mere presence of Doomsday spoiled the end to a degree, but watching the Man of Steel laboring to carry that kryptonite spear towards certain death was no less impactful. A brief word on Jesse Eisenberg's take on Lex Luthor. At least one other reviewer on this site already said it best when they pointed out that this was his origin story. If you consider his scheme objectively, he is actually one of the more formidable incarnations of the character. If we're lucky, we'll eventually get to see a Snyder Cut of \"Justice League\" and find out where this story was actually meant to go. For the record, Joss Whedon and Danny Elfman both should have said \"no\" to taking a dump on someone else's art."
"BATMAN V SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE brings a fantastic surprise to a smash-hit team-up with one of the worlds most beloved DC Comics' icons of all time. The movie delivers spectacular casting, and fantastic acting with different characters having their shine in each scenes.The story follows Clark Kent/Superman who becomes a threat, after the destruction in Metropolis in Man Of Steel.(2013). Batman/Bruce Wayne sees him as a threat and begins his war on Superman.The movie brings spectacular storytelling, it tells the complications of human against alien who are on the same side, and the first meeting of Batman and Superman. The story of Bruce Wayne, with his many years of The Caped Crusader, sends him on a spiral of \"out of control\", sheer anger, and builds tension to wanting to defeat the Man of Steel. Snyder has fantastically gave this storytelling an exciting nod to the comics.Lex Luthor, played by Jesse Einsberg, delivers a very interesting performance, but very differently by him showing is his \"origin\" before he becomes a bald foe to the Man of Steel. He shows that his love of \"god vs man\" terrorises mankind when he ultimately creates Doomsday, and Batman realises Superman's inner heroism.It packs so many great \"out of nowhere\" excitement, including a first-look of the fearful Wonder Woman a.k.a. Diana Prince, played by Gal Gadot, and a fresh-new glimpse of the superhero DC canon: The Justice League.WATCH THIS MOVIE! The critics are out of their mind. It's a fun-packed action adventure which still keeps the movie enjoyable until it's final minutes of the movie. It's a FANTASTIC MOVIE! BEN AFFLECK AS BATMAN... is Incredible!A 10/10 overall!"
"I want to go on record as saying that this is a truly thrilling cinematic experience in so many ways. If pressed, I guess I could acknowledge that there were a couple ... let's say \"clumsy\" moments. And in a film that runs to three hours, that hardly seems like a significant issue, certainly not enough to rate it with fewer than 9 stars.This film has everything. There is dramatic tension right from the start. There is a magnificent story arc that picks up quite seamlessly from 'Man of Steel' and propels the viewer not only into the life of Clark Kent/Superman but also of Bruce Wayne/Batman.The villain is no mere cartoon of a villain; he is truly thoroughly (and apparently irrevocably) diabolical. He is a psychopath, and you wish for his death over and over and over. You want Superman to reduce him to ash with the power of his eyes.I have read a number of viewers' reviews, and it seems that the people who disliked the film / gave it a low rating had rather unfair and unrealistic expectations of it. That is, their own prejudices about how the plot could/should unfold or what the character development could/should be, etc. ruined the film for them. And that is a shame.My thought is: I settle into my seat, wait for the lights to dim, and then I wait to be transported by the film. I accept it, lock, stock, and barrel.As another reviewer remarked, I love how the film begins from the point of view of Bruce Wayne as he is among people on the ground who have fallen victim to the attack of Zod and the other Kryptonians.Why would Bruce Wayne not like Superman? Why would the good people of Earth hurl insults at Superman and burn him in effigy (on the news)? Because the good people of Earth just got catapulted into a new reality in which there are not only extraterrestrial beings (surprise!) but they are also superman! And a group of them are hell-bent on destroying humankind and taking the planet for themselves.It is difficult to see Superman as separate from the whole Kryptonian Krew.It seems that many moviegoers forgot that Bruce Wayne is also human. Sure, he's a hero, but he is flawed.. Just like the rest of us. He is a vigilante, after all.He has let his vigilantism get the better of him. HE is actually the one working outside the boundaries of the law, not Superman. It is the clear head of Alfred that shows us that he has gone into a rather dark place, that he has not seen what is really going on (in Luthor's scheme), and so he chooses to embark on his own scheme scheme to take out the alien invader. He is (allegedly) thinking of the future: if he wipes out the all-powerful alien, then it can't turn on humankind in the future. At least, he convinces himself of that.A philosophical question is raised in the film: should Clark Kent have remained a simple man from Kansas and never have become the Superman? Should he just let people die and let calamities happen? The question is answered for us in the character of Diana Prince/Wonder Woman. She withdrew from mankind (her exact words) and just sat around watching. Watching while people died horrible deaths all around her. So, should Superman have done the same? Do these special beings, these 'metahumans', have some kind of moral imperative to intervene, or should they be allowed to be regular people, too? It seems that humans want it both ways.It seems that humans are saying: \"Don't be a superalien ... except when I and my friends and family are in trouble. Then come save us.\""

"Batman v Superman: Ultimate Edition: If your looking for a quick, cheap thrill then you might not enjoy this film at the time. This movies theatrical version was butchered by WB and in doing so reshaped the story leaving numerous plot holes. So the Ultimate Edition is the full story and the one worth seeing. Watch 'Man of Steel' before seeing this movie. There is much to claw through here, so much so that the audience might easily find themselves exhausted from the overall aggression of the film. However, a lot of the story does work. The action is good, and the emotion feels real most of the time.This film is about Superman trying to become Superman. Trying to help the world, save people, find a place in this world not as an outcast, and yet is looked at has a threat by many. Superman is not from this world, yet He is trying to be human, find a place in this world, be excepted by earths people, and come into his destiny.This film is also about Batman being Batman for 20 years and losing faith in humanity, and fearing Superman, what Superman can do with his powers. Great film, great plot, great visuals. ---Yidioo"
"I didn't see the film in the theaters and just bought the \"Extended Edition \" on Amazon. I never properly saw Man of Steel- i think I rented it and watched it when already exhausted and fell asleep. I saw the mediocre user reviews and horrible reviews from critics of this film.They really have it wrong. This is the very best either Batman or Superman. It has a different take, on things. Much darker then earlier films even darker then the Christopher Nolan Batman films.First of all Christopher Nolan is an Executive Producer. So how bad could it be? I loved Sucker Punch and Zack Snyder was involved with that. So how bad could this be? Hans Zimmer did the music, so how bad could it be?I remember watching the old Superman TV shows and reading the Superman and Batman comics as a little kid and loved them, but i wouldn't call myself a \"fan boy\" of comic universes, like so many younger people today. As an older adult I will admit my favorite TV show of all time was Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but watched it on DVD only after it had finished. I saw the second of the Dark Knight series in the theater, but the other two, I watched on DVD. They were great, but not my favorite films like so many people. i also loved the first couple Superman and Batman films in the older series. Regardless, i was not waiting with baited breath to see Man of Steel or this one.I'm more of a serious film fan, who can watch Stanley Kubrick films over and over and my favorite films in the last twenty years, are Eyes Wide Shut and Intersteller, both of which i've watched multiple times.So, with that said, take it from me, the critics have this film very wrong, just as critics hated 2001: A Space Odyssey when it first came out. This film will have lasting appreciation.Surprised how much I liked Ben Afleck's Batman. it was hard to get into Henry Cavil's scrawnier looking Superman, but it grew on me. Amy Adams was great as Lois Lane, The Gal Gadol Wonder Women was amazing. Lex Luther was terrific, like Nolan's Joker. Jeremy Irons was the best Alfred ever. Holly Hunter and Diane Lane was good too. The movie had bad reviews but made a billion dollars. Hopefully everyone buys the Ultimate Edition and it breaks sales records and the film is re-appreciated. I have no idea what scenes this Ultimate Edition added, but it is pretty perfect. Now I can't wait for Wonder Woman and the Justice League and as soon as I finish writing this am going to watch Man of Steal. I'm into it now!I can only surmise that the bad reviews stem from too much expectations of the rigid fan boy types and the radical changes in tone, we see in this film.Total masterpiece of cinema, but I have a few criticisms. There are a few hollow scenes of typical Idiot cops and authorities getting everything wrong in a cliché type way and it has a few filler scenes of that type and a few moments here and there that felt rushed and cheesy. Maybe not everything restored into the Ultimate Edition should have been. I wish there had been more Kevin Costner scenes."

"The whole entire Batman V Superman movie was great and yes even though it felt slow to the majority of the people who watched it but to me I enjoyed every part and every scene of Batman V Superman and when it got to the fight scenes both batman VS Superman and the Doomsday fight it brought so much drama, intensity, and epic performances. So with that being said I give this movie a good 10/10 because it really did go to my expectations and it brought a powerful performance and a powerful yet epic introduction to the upcoming Justice League."

"When I first wrote a review for this movie a year ago exclaiming my excitement for the film, I had been high off a fresh dose of live-action DC superheroes playing out the beloved comic book stories that I had grown up on. It was all playing out before my eyes and coming to life. After a few months had passed, I began to notice things about the movie that I disliked: little gaps in the story, things that didn't add up, etc. My original rating of a 10 / 10 dropped to an 8 /10. But today it has gone back up to a 10. The extended version of the film not only rectifies the gaps but also silences critics.Many claimed that the movie was too dark or that it just didn't make sense. To those people, I say: \"Pick up a comic book!\" Many of the critics of this particular film were part of the superhero bandwagon that formed when Marvel began its spree of Avengers-related films. In fact, its estimated that over 60% of people who go to see 'superhero' genre films have never picked up a comic book in their life. I would argue that similar numbers could figure to those which view the CW televised DC Universe shows. People complain that DC comics is just too dark but the fact is that these movies are based upon actual comics which are meant to be dark (ex: The Dark Knight Returns, Injustice, etc.). Its like complaining that Game of Thrones (the TV series) sucks because they kill off too many characters. Read the books! Its frustrating to see such a beautiful work of art like Batman V Superman criticized by those ignorant to its universe and its meaning. This movie is in fact a catalyst that opens numerous doorways and leaves true fans in awe of the possibilities for future movies. But regardless of whether or not people choose to educate themselves, this film's DVD/Blu-ray extended version puts the theater release to shame. All of the plot holes and gaps are filled in 30 minutes of extended footage scattered throughout the film. The movie ultimately becomes more complete and people will wish that the movie had shown the full 3 hours of footage in its theatrical debut. As a major DC comics fan, I will of course pick up on things that a comics fan would not, but someone who does not read comics would learn to appreciate this film in its entirety with the extended version. Get your hands on a copy today or find it on Netflix or the internet somewhere!"

"I ignored the bad reviews and watched anyways. This film had a lot to live up to after Civil War was released and I went into this film expecting the worst. It ended up to be the best Superhero film of 2016 to me. One complaint was that this film was more concerned about universe building than telling a great story than Civil War but for me it was the other way around; Civil War felt like a build up to something else and to be honest, I felt that way when I saw the other MCU films. Batman vs Superman however not only had a great story, but it also felt a lot more consistent than Civil War. This film was way more diverse with the cast than the MCU but unlike the MCU, I felt like this film doesn't go overboard with the SJW stuff like the MCU films or The Star Wars Sequel films do. The Visuals were AMAZING, The Score by Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL was AMAZING as well, The Tone is just right as I actually felt for the characters emotionally, The Cinematography kept my eyes glued to the screen, and the script felt really Intelligent and Complex and despite people calling the writing confusing, I was able to piece it together with no problem whatsoever. This film is similar to Empire Strikes back in terms of popularity so over time after the other movies are released, this movie would probably be more popular.This film was way better than I Expected and deserves another chance.

"Its shame to see what critics and marvel fans did to this movie and targeted Zack Snyder for it. I have seen this movie more than 25 times till date. And i enjoy this movie as much as i enjoyed the first time. The fans who have read DC comics, wouldn't be disappointed in this movie. Its dark movie, yes it is. Because the title shows the intense situation at hand. Two superheroes about to rip each other apart for whatever reasons that brought them to this stage. Yes it had to be dark and intense.Only marvel can be stupid enough to show an alien invasion where humans are loosing the battle and the super heroes are cracking jokes while battles as if they are playing ping pong. a person playing Call of Duty game is more serious while playing than the marvel heroes fighting aliens."

"Last week some news came out from somebody online who had claimed to have seen a finished version of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. If you were like me, you've been leery of checking it out because you weren't sure how much might actually be true. Now Zack Snyder has spoken out about the spoiler-filled post, although his response doesn't really clear anything up.In a word, to MTV, he called the post \"hilarious,which might imply that he's saying that it's mostly, if not entirely, untrue. That might be the case, but then again he could have just said it was untrue and he didn't say that. What he did say, however, is that he doesn't like spoilers. While this may seem odd for the director who's most recent trailer appeared to give away the entire movie, Snyder says that's not the case. Even if you've seen the trailer, you can rest easy, as there is much more we have not seen in then finished film. Says Snyder I have the benefit of seeing the movie. It's cool that think it's too much, and I appreciate people not wanting to know, but there's plenty that they don't know. There's a lot of movie that's not in the trailer. In the process of calling the Batman v Superman Reddit review hilarious, Snyder goes on to talk about how he hates it when spoilers come out. The director would much rather that fans see the movie mostly blind. While he understands that some fans may wish to find the answers before hand, he wants his movies to be mysteries going in. If you're, as an audience member, exploring these articles, looking for answers to questions that you have, maybe you're okay with knowing before you go. It's like an individual taste. But like I said, I want people to see the movie without knowing.Spoilers are a topic that mean different things to different people. While most try to avoid them to some degree, the need to solve the mystery is a nearly universal human experience. We have an inclination to want to know the truth, even while also wanting to be surprised. For most of us getting some information is good, but getting all the information is bad, of course, only getting the details that you want can be difficult."
"The theatrical is choppy, poorly edited, hard to follow, with some really good moments mixed in their. The extended is much more fluent and is much easier to follow, it does have a long runtime, which might make it seem a bit dragging on, but if you like long films done right, like Lord of the Rings, you will like this movie as long as you get into the characters and story. Speaking of which, the story starts out perfectly showing Bruce Wayne as a character, and it is very powerful. There are several moments in this movie that are powerful, emotional, and shocking. Characters. Batman is my favorite fictional character of all time, and believe me when I say, Ben Affleck as Batman was perfect, he had the charisma, the anger, and the look of being through some bad stuff Gal Gadot also does perfect as Wonder Woman, but if you want to really see how good she does, go watch the Wonder Woman movie. Henry Call as Superman. I really don't like it when people say Christopher Reeves is better. Don't get me wrong, Reeves does great, but can you imagine him as Superman in this movie? I wouldn't like it. It would be like Adam West playing Batman in The Dark Knight. Henry Cavill does great in this role, I can say everything about him as I said with Ben Affleck. Jesse Eisenberg as Luthor. I thought it was different in a good way. I've heard a criticism for him as being too much like Joker, but is that a bad thing? Joker is my favorite villain, so to see Superman have an enemy that crazy, but still hold the values Luthor needs to be Luthor, I think it is great. The thing I thought this movie was lacking in the first and second acts was humor, at least good humor. If there was more humor, I would've given this movie a ten because it would give a more relaxing feel to the parts that needed it. All in all though, this movie was awesome, it had powerful moments, it was badass, and just plain fun. It had a great story arc and does its job very well."

"*I will be talking about the Ultimate Edition of the film* This was one of the most anticipated CBM of all time. Ever since the arrival and subsequent success of Marvel's The Avengers people have wondered when will DC launch its own cinematic universe, one of the main reasons being the opportunity to finally see titans such as Batman and Superman share the screen together: the ultimate nerd dream. On 2016, the moment finally came for BvS to be released AND.. it performed poorly. Not only did critical reception left a lot to be desired, but fan reactions where surprisingly split after its cinematic debut. People either loved it and called Zack a genius, or hated it and called him a hack. Me, personally, I found myself with middle of the road feelings, for sure, but more leaning towards the negative side with subsequent viewings. The theatrical cut of the film showcased amazing performances, incredible visuals, and action set pieces that seemed like comic book panels come to life, in a good way. However, when it comes to its narrative structure and more technical aspects like editing, the film was seriously flawed. More plot holes than Age of Ultron, questionable character decisions, random editing that lacked cohesion and focus, and forced dramatic moments that lacked any impact because the attempts at character development ranged from limited to nonexistent, especially when it comes to Superman's character. I thought it was a 5/10 movie at best. As such, I was kind of skeptical about the idea of a 30 minute longer version. I say kind of because I know how Zack works. I remember Watchmen being vastly improved with its director's cut, so in a way I was expecting BvS to perform in a similar manner, but I also feared those 30 minutes wold be just there to amplify action and discredit storytelling issues. Oh boy, I'm so glad I was proved wrong. The ultimate cut of the film was infuriating, but not because it was awful, but because it questions the sanity of WB executives and editors and makes you wonder what were they thinking during the editing process. What I got out of the Ultimate Edition was a thought-provoking deconstruction of two very iconic superheroes that gave spotlight to the struggles both of them face when they aren't fighting crime. What I got was an extremely well produced character study on both Batman and Superman in a cynical world, a world dangerously close to our own. We meet Batman as a ruthless, worn out hero that has seen the failure behind his ideals and witnessed some truly horrifying things in his life. Superman, on the other hand, is portrayed as a godlike figure that seeks to do good in the world, but finds himself emotionally conflicted once he realized that every good deed he does leaves behind a trail of destruction (most of it due to Luthor's antics). In my opinion, this is a hugely original approach, one that distances itself from the rest of the competition and delivers a dark, somber, yet relevant superhero movie that understands both characters and gives them real human struggles to deal with. I felt invested in both of them, and hoped that by the end of the film both could find a way to redeem themselves. Their character arcs were very well established during the first two acts of the movie, and by the time we get to the titular climactic battle the emotion behind the jaw-dropping action is intensified. Lex Luthor as a villain was also given more time to develop with this new edition. One of the main criticisms with the original version was the fact that his plan relied too much on conveniences, and the character's mannerisms and mad-scientist attitude was annoying, and that goes without saying his motivations were unclear. Not only do we spend more time understanding his hate for any godlike figure and thus his hatred for Superman, but the added scenes allowed us to witness his entire plan come to fruition. It sells the cold, manipulative, calculating attributes of his comic counterpart. The acting is spot on. Every actor owns his/her role, from Cavill's Superman, to Ben Affleck as Batman, Eisenberg as Luthor, and Gadot as Wonder Woman, whose scenes are brief, but are more than enough to sell the strong and ferocious warrior that she is. Cinematography is stunning, and miles above that of Man of Steel's. And the soundtrack by Zimmer and Junkie XL? Perfect, just perfect. When it comes to flaws, the film still has some of those. The Martha moment, while serving as a pivotal character moment for Batman, felt off in execution, and its understandable that many people got mad at it. If your main complaint about BvS the first time around was its bleak tone and subject matter, this film is still not for you. I understand most were expecting to see the heroes being the most iconic versions of themselves, clashing in an elongated battle and evoking the same feelings The Avengers gave audiences back in 2012. In that sense, the film will remain divisive, but at least I have the comfort of saying that, at the very least, the film is competently made."

"This film was amazing. Ben Affleck was easily the best part of this movie, he brought his a-game as Batman. The chemistry between Affleck & Irons was outstanding. Gal Gadot did a great job as Wonder Woman. The fight between Batman & Superman was awesome. The final fight with Doomsday was outstanding in every way possible. However, there is only one problem with this film and that's Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor. He was sadly missed cast in this role, but then again it's really the fault of Warner Bros. Studios. Overall, this film deliver on almost every level. I highly recommend that you watch the extended version of this film."

"I know I know. I saw it in theaters too, and felt like it could've been so much better. While the Batman element was good, the narrative felt fractured, and the third act was just one long stunt scene. Superman was relegated to a supporting character, and other characters didn't get a chance to shine. And then I chanced on the ultimate cut. Calling it 30 mins of \"extra\" footage is unfair to Zack Snyder because it's exactly these 30 mins that makes the movie a worthy one. What I can say about the theatrical cut is this - It had the blockbuster elements - music, visuals, stunts, CGI. But, it lacked the human elements. The first 20 mins of the movie had it, but not after that. The extended cut in comparison has a flow to the narrative. There are no disjointed scenes, everything flows smoothly, and there's connective tissue. Superman gets to spend some time with his father, and mother. Clark Kent does some investigative journalism. Superman helps the people after the blast. Lois Lane doesn't jump to conclusions, she gets to the bottom of the crime. Lex Luthor apparently had a coherent plan - everything is explained pretty well. Wonder Woman was already good, so there's no change there :) Also, the \"Martha\" scene seems better executed, because it is a few seconds longer, and there's time to breathe it in. So, here's my take on this movie - The theatrical cut was junk. Get the Bluray for ultimate edition, and you shall not be disappointed. I've seen it so many more times now, and it's the definitive cut. It is the movie we deserve. It's a unique take on Batman, and Superman. It's a gritty take on the superhero movie genre, and definitely the best DCEU movie, and the best DC movie since The Dark Knight.P.S. Yes it's dark. We're adults, and we should appreciate mature film making without intentionally silly moments. It attempts to be philosophical, and something deep instead of just trying to make you chuckle."

"This is one of the best superhero movies ever made. Zack Snyder is a magician behind the camera.The reason behind so many complaints is the fact that Warner Bros. marketed this movie as a fight between Batman and Superman. That's not what it is. It's a movie about the origins of the Justice League.The cinematography, the acting and the score are all second to none. This film is phenomenal.P.S: watch the 3 hour extended cut that Snyder intended you to see, not the 2 and a half hour movie that Warner Bros. decided would be better for theaters."

"I don't care what the critics say, this is a very well-done movie. I'll start my review by listing what I like about the movie.1.) Ben Affleck is the best batman to me and it is not close. He pulls off the role of an aging batman extremely well. Also, Zack Snyder's vision of batman is legit. I have always hated batman up until this adaptation of him. Instead of being a conflicted and idealistic batman, this batman is dark, gritty, and 100% a badass. His equipment is decked out with machine guns and he has no aversion to killing people. In fact, he probably kills about 50 criminal by the time this movie is over. The warehouse scene is the coolest batman scene in any movie.2.) The development of a grudge between batman and superman is pulled off flawlessly. It actually makes sense why batman dislikes superman. Then, when they do fight it is about the coolest thing you can expect to see from a superhero film. 3.) I disagree with a lot of people about Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor. In my opinion, he played his role to perfection. 4.) B v S sets up Wonder Woman and Justice League with Gal Gadot's cameo as Wonder Woman and short clips of Aquaman, the Flash, and Cyborg. B v S is one of my favorite superhero films and rewatching it never gets old."

"The theatrical cut of this film is garbage which is why I rated it eight stars instead of nine. The first time I watched this film I didn't like it (not straight out hate but didn't like). Character motivations didn't make any sense, Lex was annoying as s***, editing was sloppy, and it was overly dark and broody for an action superhero movie. A year + a half, five Marvel films, a ton of bad reviews and a Justice League later a thought popped into my head: \"what if I watched BVS again\". This time I didn't have trailers ruining the best moments, I only vaguely remembered the film, and I was conditioned to look at it negatively but something unexpected happened: I actually loved it. Superman was just a normal person that tried to make a difference cause he could that others imposed their own beliefs on. Lex Luthor was a genius that couldn't stand his powerlessness compared to Superman or more accurately a super being. As Alfred said \"The fever, the rage, the feeling of powerlessness that turns good men... cruel\" and you see the same thought process in Batman. Batman, just like Lex Luthor feels powerless in the midst of a god-being and just like Lex he attempts to destroy him so he can get his sense of power back but unlike Lex, Batman learns something. I what is one of the corniest lines of the movie Superman says, \"Martha\" when he knows he can't win against Batman in a late desperate attempt to save his mother. Not only does this name connect with Bruce Wayne but it also shows what really matters to a man of steel: it isn't power, it isn't fame or anything else, it is his Mother and on a broader scale it is people. Lex (who doesn't care about people at all) knows he doesn't have the power so he creates something from his blood and the remains of Zod: A Doomsday for Superman. Not only does this film have depth but it also doesn't always explain it to you which is rare in a blockbuster action superhero flick normally cater to semi-comic book fans and people that want to shove popcorn in their mouths. This film rewards you for really noticing the details while still having massive explosions. One of my favorites is how Lex has all of Batman's branded killed which is why he isn't afraid of the branding at the end or Grandma's Peach Tea as a way of scaring the s*** out of someone. Of course, this film isn't perfect and I do have personal dislikes. The Batman V Superman fight was slow and pretty boring especially after watching such an amazing fight in Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 2 (If you haven't watched the animated Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 1 and 2 you are sorely missing out on something fantastic). Also, the addition of Wonder Woman who pretty much steals a hacker thing, gives it back and then suits up and fights against a giant monster thing. Not to say I don't like Wonder Woman (She is one of my favorite Superheroes of all time who showed not only can woman kick a** but they also don't need to be ashamed of their sexuality or gender) but she wasn't really that helpful to the plot and just brought in to expand the universe which was well done through Lex's superhuman hunting files. Also, the post-apocalyptic scene that was just a dream could have been cut but nothing is perfect except movies like Citizen Kane which isn't a lot of fun to watch cause it is too perfect. So to summarize, the theatrical cut is bad, the ultimate cut is Amazing and the other cut is meh. Please give it a second chance because it deserves it and save a good director from losing grace because of something he didn't do."
"I really liked it, don't know what all the hate is about. I'm actually a Marvel fan from when I was 7 or so, but Superman and Batman together in 1 movie? Just great. And personally I like Ben Affleck even better than Christian Bale as Batman. So just watch and enjoy, I know I did!"

"That's right. We have been waiting for these two heroes to finally meet and fight against each other. This movie is so good in both plot and special effects.Henry Cavill and Ben Affleck have performed well in their acting stages. They are the best superhero actors and they have filmed their fighting scenes very well. The movie starts to show the conflict between the lives of the heroes and now they have blamed each other for it. This movie is amazing and sets up a good plot for Dawn Justice."

"Actually...I didn't know what to expect. When you see Wonder Woman, you know it will be off of Wonder Woman and off of a Wonder Woman story, but with Batman V Superman, I was like, \"hmmmm, so who is this about?\" It was pretty obvious that it would feature many characters, but I thought the introduction to Batman was amazing. Ben Affleck nailed the part, not only as Batman but also as Bruce Wayne. He is my Batman. Henry Cavill continued to be super as the Man of Steel. And he is my Super - Man. A dark story? Yes, without a doubt. Could it have had a few more jokes? Sure. But not all movies or stories need to have jokes when certain events are serious. I really hope people can see this review and take another look at the movie, because, I loved it. I really hope the ratings can go up, eventually. And P.S, this movie is the perfect set up to Justice League."

"This film is crucial to the extended universe that DC is trying to build, but it feels highly derivative of better stories and continues to demonstrate the misuse of the iconic characters mentioned in the title. Plus Jesse Eisenberg feels wildly mis-casted."

"I'll start by making it clear I have only ever seen the Ultimate Edition. I'm aware of what was cut out for the theatrical release, so I will concede up front that most of the criticisms about pacing, editing, and missing bits of plot at release were merited.With that caveat out of the way, I must reiterate that this was bar-none the boldest superhero movie I have ever seen. To me, it was arguably the best as well, though \"best\" shouldn't be taken to mean \"most enjoyable.\" That honor easily goes to \"Thor: Ragnarok.\" What makes BvS stand out among other films in the genre is that it takes two characters who have been done to death since the 1970s and brings them up to date. I recently tried to watch \"Superman: The Movie\" for the first time in a number of years, and while it was still good and Reeves will always be iconic, I just couldn't take it seriously. I'll put it this way: If the story in BvS was \"stupid\" in your view but Superman turning back time by spinning the earth backward on its axis didn't seem like one of the dumbest things you have ever seen -in any movie from any genre- to the extent that it outright ruins the movie for you, then your opinion about BvS isn't worth much. Nostalgic bias was always going to be a problem for this movie, and the way people reacted to and reviewed \"Man of Steel\" was telling in this regard.That brings me to Zack Snyder's take on Superman. You know, that guy whose status as the first extraterrestrial ever encountered by humanity was a total non-issue in the old movies. Apparently, Snyder has a similar view to my own in that his take on the Man of Steel makes his being an alien a core piece of his identity. He may look like any other (absurdly attractive) person, but he knows what he is, and that makes him perpetually uncertain of where he fits in this world. He is essentially good and really does care about people, but he struggles to truly empathize with the likes of us. To be human is to be frail, and that is not something he can easily relate to. This is the root of his conflict with Batman.Just as Clark struggles to genuinely relate to most people, Snyder's Batman either refuses to or otherwise just can't relate to Superman. He doesn't see him as anything but a threat regardless of Superman's clear good intentions. Remember, a small group of Kryptonians were able to bring humanity to the brink of extinction in less than a day, and Bruce Wayne is nothing if not a realist. He didn't know the guy from Kansas. He only knew the god from another world.While Batman's anger toward and fear of Superman are readily apparent from the start, Superman's inability to imagine things from Bruce Wayne's perspective only becomes truly apparent during their first real interaction. This reminded me of the animated version of the \"world's finest\" storyline, where Superman judges Batman harshly for using fear tactics and threats of violence (also, actual violence) to get the job done. Superman wasn't willing to consider what it would take for a human man to fight criminals and save innocents, or what that life would do to him over time. Just as Batman didn't see the guy from Kansas, Superman didn't see the man who lives his life trapped in one brutal, unthinkably traumatic moment (this was beautifully conveyed during the film's opening moments), and had spent his whole adult life bearing witness to humanity at its absolute worst.The conflict between these two characters is as old as human history. They want the same things, but they can't understand one another. So they fight. And what a fight it was.Watching a fight between, say, Captain America and Iron Man was, to me, more frustrating than anything because each understood the other's perspective perfectly. The fight between Batman and Superman in BvS was genuinely gut-wrenching, as intended, because they would have understood one another if either had tried. The whole sequence hilighted Batman's tactical prowess and ability to control a situation. Maybe the most badass thing about the fight was that it ended exactly where Batman planned. That brings me to the big elephant in the room named \"Martha.\"I can't recall exactly which YouTuber put it this way, but if you thought the \"save Martha\" exchange was about their mothers having the same name, you had your brain turned off. The brain-on people have explained this to death, but it bears repeating. This was the moment when Superman became humanized to Batman. He was about to die, and his only concern was for his adoptive human mother. He still believed that the man about to take his life would do the right thing. Even with the cowl on, there was no mistaking the look on Batman's face. It was the look of shame, guilt, and sudden uncertainty that says \"What am I doing?\" Turns out even the most brutal, angry version of Bruce Wayne is better than Tony Stark at knowing right from wrong. At knowing that he had gone too far.From there, the third act was a series of truly impressive (albeit mostly CGI) fight sequences, beginning with what I regard as the undisputed champion of Batman fights. Nothing in the Nolan movies (and especially nothing in the Burton movies) even came close. Go ahead, try to convince yourself that Batman and Bane taking turns punching one another in the face until Bane's mask broke was a good fight sequence. No, this was a fight straight out of \"Arkham Knight,\" and it was glorious. The battle against Doomsday really was one for the books. From the moment Wonder Woman arrived accompanied by the intense sounds of Tina Guo's electric cello to Superman's tragic, heroic death at the hands of Doomsday, I was glued to the screen. Sure, the mere presence of Doomsday spoiled the end to a degree, but watching the Man of Steel laboring to carry that kryptonite spear towards certain death was no less impactful. A brief word on Jesse Eisenberg's take on Lex Luthor. At least one other reviewer on this site already said it best when they pointed out that this was his origin story. If you consider his scheme objectively, he is actually one of the more formidable incarnations of the character. If we're lucky, we'll eventually get to see a Snyder Cut of \"Justice League\" and find out where this story was actually meant to go. For the record, Joss Whedon and Danny Elfman both should have said \"no\" to taking a dump on someone else's art."
"BATMAN V SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE brings a fantastic surprise to a smash-hit team-up with one of the worlds most beloved DC Comics' icons of all time. The movie delivers spectacular casting, and fantastic acting with different characters having their shine in each scenes.The story follows Clark Kent/Superman who becomes a threat, after the destruction in Metropolis in Man Of Steel.(2013). Batman/Bruce Wayne sees him as a threat and begins his war on Superman.The movie brings spectacular storytelling, it tells the complications of human against alien who are on the same side, and the first meeting of Batman and Superman. The story of Bruce Wayne, with his many years of The Caped Crusader, sends him on a spiral of \"out of control\", sheer anger, and builds tension to wanting to defeat the Man of Steel. Snyder has fantastically gave this storytelling an exciting nod to the comics.Lex Luthor, played by Jesse Einsberg, delivers a very interesting performance, but very differently by him showing is his \"origin\" before he becomes a bald foe to the Man of Steel. He shows that his love of \"god vs man\" terrorises mankind when he ultimately creates Doomsday, and Batman realises Superman's inner heroism.It packs so many great \"out of nowhere\" excitement, including a first-look of the fearful Wonder Woman a.k.a. Diana Prince, played by Gal Gadot, and a fresh-new glimpse of the superhero DC canon: The Justice League.WATCH THIS MOVIE! The critics are out of their mind. It's a fun-packed action adventure which still keeps the movie enjoyable until it's final minutes of the movie. It's a FANTASTIC MOVIE! BEN AFFLECK AS BATMAN... is Incredible!A 10/10 overall!"
"I want to go on record as saying that this is a truly thrilling cinematic experience in so many ways. If pressed, I guess I could acknowledge that there were a couple ... let's say \"clumsy\" moments. And in a film that runs to three hours, that hardly seems like a significant issue, certainly not enough to rate it with fewer than 9 stars.This film has everything. There is dramatic tension right from the start. There is a magnificent story arc that picks up quite seamlessly from 'Man of Steel' and propels the viewer not only into the life of Clark Kent/Superman but also of Bruce Wayne/Batman.The villain is no mere cartoon of a villain; he is truly thoroughly (and apparently irrevocably) diabolical. He is a psychopath, and you wish for his death over and over and over. You want Superman to reduce him to ash with the power of his eyes.I have read a number of viewers' reviews, and it seems that the people who disliked the film / gave it a low rating had rather unfair and unrealistic expectations of it. That is, their own prejudices about how the plot could/should unfold or what the character development could/should be, etc. ruined the film for them. And that is a shame.My thought is: I settle into my seat, wait for the lights to dim, and then I wait to be transported by the film. I accept it, lock, stock, and barrel.As another reviewer remarked, I love how the film begins from the point of view of Bruce Wayne as he is among people on the ground who have fallen victim to the attack of Zod and the other Kryptonians.Why would Bruce Wayne not like Superman? Why would the good people of Earth hurl insults at Superman and burn him in effigy (on the news)? Because the good people of Earth just got catapulted into a new reality in which there are not only extraterrestrial beings (surprise!) but they are also superman! And a group of them are hell-bent on destroying humankind and taking the planet for themselves.It is difficult to see Superman as separate from the whole Kryptonian Krew.It seems that many moviegoers forgot that Bruce Wayne is also human. Sure, he's a hero, but he is flawed.. Just like the rest of us. He is a vigilante, after all.He has let his vigilantism get the better of him. HE is actually the one working outside the boundaries of the law, not Superman. It is the clear head of Alfred that shows us that he has gone into a rather dark place, that he has not seen what is really going on (in Luthor's scheme), and so he chooses to embark on his own scheme scheme to take out the alien invader. He is (allegedly) thinking of the future: if he wipes out the all-powerful alien, then it can't turn on humankind in the future. At least, he convinces himself of that.A philosophical question is raised in the film: should Clark Kent have remained a simple man from Kansas and never have become the Superman? Should he just let people die and let calamities happen? The question is answered for us in the character of Diana Prince/Wonder Woman. She withdrew from mankind (her exact words) and just sat around watching. Watching while people died horrible deaths all around her. So, should Superman have done the same? Do these special beings, these 'metahumans', have some kind of moral imperative to intervene, or should they be allowed to be regular people, too? It seems that humans want it both ways.It seems that humans are saying: \"Don't be a superalien ... except when I and my friends and family are in trouble. Then come save us.\""

"Batman v Superman: Ultimate Edition: If your looking for a quick, cheap thrill then you might not enjoy this film at the time. This movies theatrical version was butchered by WB and in doing so reshaped the story leaving numerous plot holes. So the Ultimate Edition is the full story and the one worth seeing. Watch 'Man of Steel' before seeing this movie. There is much to claw through here, so much so that the audience might easily find themselves exhausted from the overall aggression of the film. However, a lot of the story does work. The action is good, and the emotion feels real most of the time.This film is about Superman trying to become Superman. Trying to help the world, save people, find a place in this world not as an outcast, and yet is looked at has a threat by many. Superman is not from this world, yet He is trying to be human, find a place in this world, be excepted by earths people, and come into his destiny.This film is also about Batman being Batman for 20 years and losing faith in humanity, and fearing Superman, what Superman can do with his powers. Great film, great plot, great visuals. ---Yidioo"
"I didn't see the film in the theaters and just bought the \"Extended Edition \" on Amazon. I never properly saw Man of Steel- i think I rented it and watched it when already exhausted and fell asleep. I saw the mediocre user reviews and horrible reviews from critics of this film.They really have it wrong. This is the very best either Batman or Superman. It has a different take, on things. Much darker then earlier films even darker then the Christopher Nolan Batman films.First of all Christopher Nolan is an Executive Producer. So how bad could it be? I loved Sucker Punch and Zack Snyder was involved with that. So how bad could this be? Hans Zimmer did the music, so how bad could it be?I remember watching the old Superman TV shows and reading the Superman and Batman comics as a little kid and loved them, but i wouldn't call myself a \"fan boy\" of comic universes, like so many younger people today. As an older adult I will admit my favorite TV show of all time was Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but watched it on DVD only after it had finished. I saw the second of the Dark Knight series in the theater, but the other two, I watched on DVD. They were great, but not my favorite films like so many people. i also loved the first couple Superman and Batman films in the older series. Regardless, i was not waiting with baited breath to see Man of Steel or this one.I'm more of a serious film fan, who can watch Stanley Kubrick films over and over and my favorite films in the last twenty years, are Eyes Wide Shut and Intersteller, both of which i've watched multiple times.So, with that said, take it from me, the critics have this film very wrong, just as critics hated 2001: A Space Odyssey when it first came out. This film will have lasting appreciation.Surprised how much I liked Ben Afleck's Batman. it was hard to get into Henry Cavil's scrawnier looking Superman, but it grew on me. Amy Adams was great as Lois Lane, The Gal Gadol Wonder Women was amazing. Lex Luther was terrific, like Nolan's Joker. Jeremy Irons was the best Alfred ever. Holly Hunter and Diane Lane was good too. The movie had bad reviews but made a billion dollars. Hopefully everyone buys the Ultimate Edition and it breaks sales records and the film is re-appreciated. I have no idea what scenes this Ultimate Edition added, but it is pretty perfect. Now I can't wait for Wonder Woman and the Justice League and as soon as I finish writing this am going to watch Man of Steal. I'm into it now!I can only surmise that the bad reviews stem from too much expectations of the rigid fan boy types and the radical changes in tone, we see in this film.Total masterpiece of cinema, but I have a few criticisms. There are a few hollow scenes of typical Idiot cops and authorities getting everything wrong in a cliché type way and it has a few filler scenes of that type and a few moments here and there that felt rushed and cheesy. Maybe not everything restored into the Ultimate Edition should have been. I wish there had been more Kevin Costner scenes."

"The whole entire Batman V Superman movie was great and yes even though it felt slow to the majority of the people who watched it but to me I enjoyed every part and every scene of Batman V Superman and when it got to the fight scenes both batman VS Superman and the Doomsday fight it brought so much drama, intensity, and epic performances. So with that being said I give this movie a good 10/10 because it really did go to my expectations and it brought a powerful performance and a powerful yet epic introduction to the upcoming Justice League."

"When I first wrote a review for this movie a year ago exclaiming my excitement for the film, I had been high off a fresh dose of live-action DC superheroes playing out the beloved comic book stories that I had grown up on. It was all playing out before my eyes and coming to life. After a few months had passed, I began to notice things about the movie that I disliked: little gaps in the story, things that didn't add up, etc. My original rating of a 10 / 10 dropped to an 8 /10. But today it has gone back up to a 10. The extended version of the film not only rectifies the gaps but also silences critics.Many claimed that the movie was too dark or that it just didn't make sense. To those people, I say: \"Pick up a comic book!\" Many of the critics of this particular film were part of the superhero bandwagon that formed when Marvel began its spree of Avengers-related films. In fact, its estimated that over 60% of people who go to see 'superhero' genre films have never picked up a comic book in their life. I would argue that similar numbers could figure to those which view the CW televised DC Universe shows. People complain that DC comics is just too dark but the fact is that these movies are based upon actual comics which are meant to be dark (ex: The Dark Knight Returns, Injustice, etc.). Its like complaining that Game of Thrones (the TV series) sucks because they kill off too many characters. Read the books! Its frustrating to see such a beautiful work of art like Batman V Superman criticized by those ignorant to its universe and its meaning. This movie is in fact a catalyst that opens numerous doorways and leaves true fans in awe of the possibilities for future movies. But regardless of whether or not people choose to educate themselves, this film's DVD/Blu-ray extended version puts the theater release to shame. All of the plot holes and gaps are filled in 30 minutes of extended footage scattered throughout the film. The movie ultimately becomes more complete and people will wish that the movie had shown the full 3 hours of footage in its theatrical debut. As a major DC comics fan, I will of course pick up on things that a comics fan would not, but someone who does not read comics would learn to appreciate this film in its entirety with the extended version. Get your hands on a copy today or find it on Netflix or the internet somewhere!"

"I ignored the bad reviews and watched anyways. This film had a lot to live up to after Civil War was released and I went into this film expecting the worst. It ended up to be the best Superhero film of 2016 to me. One complaint was that this film was more concerned about universe building than telling a great story than Civil War but for me it was the other way around; Civil War felt like a build up to something else and to be honest, I felt that way when I saw the other MCU films. Batman vs Superman however not only had a great story, but it also felt a lot more consistent than Civil War. This film was way more diverse with the cast than the MCU but unlike the MCU, I felt like this film doesn't go overboard with the SJW stuff like the MCU films or The Star Wars Sequel films do. The Visuals were AMAZING, The Score by Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL was AMAZING as well, The Tone is just right as I actually felt for the characters emotionally, The Cinematography kept my eyes glued to the screen, and the script felt really Intelligent and Complex and despite people calling the writing confusing, I was able to piece it together with no problem whatsoever. This film is similar to Empire Strikes back in terms of popularity so over time after the other movies are released, this movie would probably be more popular.This film was way better than I Expected and deserves another chance.

"Its shame to see what critics and marvel fans did to this movie and targeted Zack Snyder for it. I have seen this movie more than 25 times till date. And i enjoy this movie as much as i enjoyed the first time. The fans who have read DC comics, wouldn't be disappointed in this movie. Its dark movie, yes it is. Because the title shows the intense situation at hand. Two superheroes about to rip each other apart for whatever reasons that brought them to this stage. Yes it had to be dark and intense.Only marvel can be stupid enough to show an alien invasion where humans are loosing the battle and the super heroes are cracking jokes while battles as if they are playing ping pong. a person playing Call of Duty game is more serious while playing than the marvel heroes fighting aliens."

"Last week some news came out from somebody online who had claimed to have seen a finished version of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. If you were like me, you've been leery of checking it out because you weren't sure how much might actually be true. Now Zack Snyder has spoken out about the spoiler-filled post, although his response doesn't really clear anything up.In a word, to MTV, he called the post \"hilarious,which might imply that he's saying that it's mostly, if not entirely, untrue. That might be the case, but then again he could have just said it was untrue and he didn't say that. What he did say, however, is that he doesn't like spoilers. While this may seem odd for the director who's most recent trailer appeared to give away the entire movie, Snyder says that's not the case. Even if you've seen the trailer, you can rest easy, as there is much more we have not seen in then finished film. Says Snyder I have the benefit of seeing the movie. It's cool that think it's too much, and I appreciate people not wanting to know, but there's plenty that they don't know. There's a lot of movie that's not in the trailer. In the process of calling the Batman v Superman Reddit review hilarious, Snyder goes on to talk about how he hates it when spoilers come out. The director would much rather that fans see the movie mostly blind. While he understands that some fans may wish to find the answers before hand, he wants his movies to be mysteries going in. If you're, as an audience member, exploring these articles, looking for answers to questions that you have, maybe you're okay with knowing before you go. It's like an individual taste. But like I said, I want people to see the movie without knowing.Spoilers are a topic that mean different things to different people. While most try to avoid them to some degree, the need to solve the mystery is a nearly universal human experience. We have an inclination to want to know the truth, even while also wanting to be surprised. For most of us getting some information is good, but getting all the information is bad, of course, only getting the details that you want can be difficult."
"The theatrical is choppy, poorly edited, hard to follow, with some really good moments mixed in their. The extended is much more fluent and is much easier to follow, it does have a long runtime, which might make it seem a bit dragging on, but if you like long films done right, like Lord of the Rings, you will like this movie as long as you get into the characters and story. Speaking of which, the story starts out perfectly showing Bruce Wayne as a character, and it is very powerful. There are several moments in this movie that are powerful, emotional, and shocking. Characters. Batman is my favorite fictional character of all time, and believe me when I say, Ben Affleck as Batman was perfect, he had the charisma, the anger, and the look of being through some bad stuff Gal Gadot also does perfect as Wonder Woman, but if you want to really see how good she does, go watch the Wonder Woman movie. Henry Call as Superman. I really don't like it when people say Christopher Reeves is better. Don't get me wrong, Reeves does great, but can you imagine him as Superman in this movie? I wouldn't like it. It would be like Adam West playing Batman in The Dark Knight. Henry Cavill does great in this role, I can say everything about him as I said with Ben Affleck. Jesse Eisenberg as Luthor. I thought it was different in a good way. I've heard a criticism for him as being too much like Joker, but is that a bad thing? Joker is my favorite villain, so to see Superman have an enemy that crazy, but still hold the values Luthor needs to be Luthor, I think it is great. The thing I thought this movie was lacking in the first and second acts was humor, at least good humor. If there was more humor, I would've given this movie a ten because it would give a more relaxing feel to the parts that needed it. All in all though, this movie was awesome, it had powerful moments, it was badass, and just plain fun. It had a great story arc and does its job very well."

"*I will be talking about the Ultimate Edition of the film* This was one of the most anticipated CBM of all time. Ever since the arrival and subsequent success of Marvel's The Avengers people have wondered when will DC launch its own cinematic universe, one of the main reasons being the opportunity to finally see titans such as Batman and Superman share the screen together: the ultimate nerd dream. On 2016, the moment finally came for BvS to be released AND.. it performed poorly. Not only did critical reception left a lot to be desired, but fan reactions where surprisingly split after its cinematic debut. People either loved it and called Zack a genius, or hated it and called him a hack. Me, personally, I found myself with middle of the road feelings, for sure, but more leaning towards the negative side with subsequent viewings. The theatrical cut of the film showcased amazing performances, incredible visuals, and action set pieces that seemed like comic book panels come to life, in a good way. However, when it comes to its narrative structure and more technical aspects like editing, the film was seriously flawed. More plot holes than Age of Ultron, questionable character decisions, random editing that lacked cohesion and focus, and forced dramatic moments that lacked any impact because the attempts at character development ranged from limited to nonexistent, especially when it comes to Superman's character. I thought it was a 5/10 movie at best. As such, I was kind of skeptical about the idea of a 30 minute longer version. I say kind of because I know how Zack works. I remember Watchmen being vastly improved with its director's cut, so in a way I was expecting BvS to perform in a similar manner, but I also feared those 30 minutes wold be just there to amplify action and discredit storytelling issues. Oh boy, I'm so glad I was proved wrong. The ultimate cut of the film was infuriating, but not because it was awful, but because it questions the sanity of WB executives and editors and makes you wonder what were they thinking during the editing process. What I got out of the Ultimate Edition was a thought-provoking deconstruction of two very iconic superheroes that gave spotlight to the struggles both of them face when they aren't fighting crime. What I got was an extremely well produced character study on both Batman and Superman in a cynical world, a world dangerously close to our own. We meet Batman as a ruthless, worn out hero that has seen the failure behind his ideals and witnessed some truly horrifying things in his life. Superman, on the other hand, is portrayed as a godlike figure that seeks to do good in the world, but finds himself emotionally conflicted once he realized that every good deed he does leaves behind a trail of destruction (most of it due to Luthor's antics). In my opinion, this is a hugely original approach, one that distances itself from the rest of the competition and delivers a dark, somber, yet relevant superhero movie that understands both characters and gives them real human struggles to deal with. I felt invested in both of them, and hoped that by the end of the film both could find a way to redeem themselves. Their character arcs were very well established during the first two acts of the movie, and by the time we get to the titular climactic battle the emotion behind the jaw-dropping action is intensified. Lex Luthor as a villain was also given more time to develop with this new edition. One of the main criticisms with the original version was the fact that his plan relied too much on conveniences, and the character's mannerisms and mad-scientist attitude was annoying, and that goes without saying his motivations were unclear. Not only do we spend more time understanding his hate for any godlike figure and thus his hatred for Superman, but the added scenes allowed us to witness his entire plan come to fruition. It sells the cold, manipulative, calculating attributes of his comic counterpart. The acting is spot on. Every actor owns his/her role, from Cavill's Superman, to Ben Affleck as Batman, Eisenberg as Luthor, and Gadot as Wonder Woman, whose scenes are brief, but are more than enough to sell the strong and ferocious warrior that she is. Cinematography is stunning, and miles above that of Man of Steel's. And the soundtrack by Zimmer and Junkie XL? Perfect, just perfect. When it comes to flaws, the film still has some of those. The Martha moment, while serving as a pivotal character moment for Batman, felt off in execution, and its understandable that many people got mad at it. If your main complaint about BvS the first time around was its bleak tone and subject matter, this film is still not for you. I understand most were expecting to see the heroes being the most iconic versions of themselves, clashing in an elongated battle and evoking the same feelings The Avengers gave audiences back in 2012. In that sense, the film will remain divisive, but at least I have the comfort of saying that, at the very least, the film is competently made."

"This film was amazing. Ben Affleck was easily the best part of this movie, he brought his a-game as Batman. The chemistry between Affleck & Irons was outstanding. Gal Gadot did a great job as Wonder Woman. The fight between Batman & Superman was awesome. The final fight with Doomsday was outstanding in every way possible. However, there is only one problem with this film and that's Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor. He was sadly missed cast in this role, but then again it's really the fault of Warner Bros. Studios. Overall, this film deliver on almost every level. I highly recommend that you watch the extended version of this film."

"I know I know. I saw it in theaters too, and felt like it could've been so much better. While the Batman element was good, the narrative felt fractured, and the third act was just one long stunt scene. Superman was relegated to a supporting character, and other characters didn't get a chance to shine. And then I chanced on the ultimate cut. Calling it 30 mins of \"extra\" footage is unfair to Zack Snyder because it's exactly these 30 mins that makes the movie a worthy one. What I can say about the theatrical cut is this - It had the blockbuster elements - music, visuals, stunts, CGI. But, it lacked the human elements. The first 20 mins of the movie had it, but not after that. The extended cut in comparison has a flow to the narrative. There are no disjointed scenes, everything flows smoothly, and there's connective tissue. Superman gets to spend some time with his father, and mother. Clark Kent does some investigative journalism. Superman helps the people after the blast. Lois Lane doesn't jump to conclusions, she gets to the bottom of the crime. Lex Luthor apparently had a coherent plan - everything is explained pretty well. Wonder Woman was already good, so there's no change there :) Also, the \"Martha\" scene seems better executed, because it is a few seconds longer, and there's time to breathe it in. So, here's my take on this movie - The theatrical cut was junk. Get the Bluray for ultimate edition, and you shall not be disappointed. I've seen it so many more times now, and it's the definitive cut. It is the movie we deserve. It's a unique take on Batman, and Superman. It's a gritty take on the superhero movie genre, and definitely the best DCEU movie, and the best DC movie since The Dark Knight.P.S. Yes it's dark. We're adults, and we should appreciate mature film making without intentionally silly moments. It attempts to be philosophical, and something deep instead of just trying to make you chuckle."

"This is one of the best superhero movies ever made. Zack Snyder is a magician behind the camera.The reason behind so many complaints is the fact that Warner Bros. marketed this movie as a fight between Batman and Superman. That's not what it is. It's a movie about the origins of the Justice League.The cinematography, the acting and the score are all second to none. This film is phenomenal.P.S: watch the 3 hour extended cut that Snyder intended you to see, not the 2 and a half hour movie that Warner Bros. decided would be better for theaters."

"I don't care what the critics say, this is a very well-done movie. I'll start my review by listing what I like about the movie.1.) Ben Affleck is the best batman to me and it is not close. He pulls off the role of an aging batman extremely well. Also, Zack Snyder's vision of batman is legit. I have always hated batman up until this adaptation of him. Instead of being a conflicted and idealistic batman, this batman is dark, gritty, and 100% a badass. His equipment is decked out with machine guns and he has no aversion to killing people. In fact, he probably kills about 50 criminal by the time this movie is over. The warehouse scene is the coolest batman scene in any movie.2.) The development of a grudge between batman and superman is pulled off flawlessly. It actually makes sense why batman dislikes superman. Then, when they do fight it is about the coolest thing you can expect to see from a superhero film. 3.) I disagree with a lot of people about Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor. In my opinion, he played his role to perfection. 4.) B v S sets up Wonder Woman and Justice League with Gal Gadot's cameo as Wonder Woman and short clips of Aquaman, the Flash, and Cyborg. B v S is one of my favorite superhero films and rewatching it never gets old."

"The theatrical cut of this film is garbage which is why I rated it eight stars instead of nine. The first time I watched this film I didn't like it (not straight out hate but didn't like). Character motivations didn't make any sense, Lex was annoying as s***, editing was sloppy, and it was overly dark and broody for an action superhero movie. A year + a half, five Marvel films, a ton of bad reviews and a Justice League later a thought popped into my head: \"what if I watched BVS again\". This time I didn't have trailers ruining the best moments, I only vaguely remembered the film, and I was conditioned to look at it negatively but something unexpected happened: I actually loved it. Superman was just a normal person that tried to make a difference cause he could that others imposed their own beliefs on. Lex Luthor was a genius that couldn't stand his powerlessness compared to Superman or more accurately a super being. As Alfred said \"The fever, the rage, the feeling of powerlessness that turns good men... cruel\" and you see the same thought process in Batman. Batman, just like Lex Luthor feels powerless in the midst of a god-being and just like Lex he attempts to destroy him so he can get his sense of power back but unlike Lex, Batman learns something. I what is one of the corniest lines of the movie Superman says, \"Martha\" when he knows he can't win against Batman in a late desperate attempt to save his mother. Not only does this name connect with Bruce Wayne but it also shows what really matters to a man of steel: it isn't power, it isn't fame or anything else, it is his Mother and on a broader scale it is people. Lex (who doesn't care about people at all) knows he doesn't have the power so he creates something from his blood and the remains of Zod: A Doomsday for Superman. Not only does this film have depth but it also doesn't always explain it to you which is rare in a blockbuster action superhero flick normally cater to semi-comic book fans and people that want to shove popcorn in their mouths. This film rewards you for really noticing the details while still having massive explosions. One of my favorites is how Lex has all of Batman's branded killed which is why he isn't afraid of the branding at the end or Grandma's Peach Tea as a way of scaring the s*** out of someone. Of course, this film isn't perfect and I do have personal dislikes. The Batman V Superman fight was slow and pretty boring especially after watching such an amazing fight in Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 2 (If you haven't watched the animated Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 1 and 2 you are sorely missing out on something fantastic). Also, the addition of Wonder Woman who pretty much steals a hacker thing, gives it back and then suits up and fights against a giant monster thing. Not to say I don't like Wonder Woman (She is one of my favorite Superheroes of all time who showed not only can woman kick a** but they also don't need to be ashamed of their sexuality or gender) but she wasn't really that helpful to the plot and just brought in to expand the universe which was well done through Lex's superhuman hunting files. Also, the post-apocalyptic scene that was just a dream could have been cut but nothing is perfect except movies like Citizen Kane which isn't a lot of fun to watch cause it is too perfect. So to summarize, the theatrical cut is bad, the ultimate cut is Amazing and the other cut is meh. Please give it a second chance because it deserves it and save a good director from losing grace because of something he didn't do."
"I really liked it, don't know what all the hate is about. I'm actually a Marvel fan from when I was 7 or so, but Superman and Batman together in 1 movie? Just great. And personally I like Ben Affleck even better than Christian Bale as Batman. So just watch and enjoy, I know I did!"

"That's right. We have been waiting for these two heroes to finally meet and fight against each other. This movie is so good in both plot and special effects.Henry Cavill and Ben Affleck have performed well in their acting stages. They are the best superhero actors and they have filmed their fighting scenes very well. The movie starts to show the conflict between the lives of the heroes and now they have blamed each other for it. This movie is amazing and sets up a good plot for Dawn Justice."

"Actually...I didn't know what to expect. When you see Wonder Woman, you know it will be off of Wonder Woman and off of a Wonder Woman story, but with Batman V Superman, I was like, \"hmmmm, so who is this about?\" It was pretty obvious that it would feature many characters, but I thought the introduction to Batman was amazing. Ben Affleck nailed the part, not only as Batman but also as Bruce Wayne. He is my Batman. Henry Cavill continued to be super as the Man of Steel. And he is my Super - Man. A dark story? Yes, without a doubt. Could it have had a few more jokes? Sure. But not all movies or stories need to have jokes when certain events are serious. I really hope people can see this review and take another look at the movie, because, I loved it. I really hope the ratings can go up, eventually. And P.S, this movie is the perfect set up to Justice League."

"I'll start by making it clear I have only ever seen the Ultimate Edition. I'm aware of what was cut out for the theatrical release, so I will concede up front that most of the criticisms about pacing, editing, and missing bits of plot at release were merited.With that caveat out of the way, I must reiterate that this was bar-none the boldest superhero movie I have ever seen. To me, it was arguably the best as well, though \"best\" shouldn't be taken to mean \"most enjoyable.\" That honor easily goes to \"Thor: Ragnarok.\" What makes BvS stand out among other films in the genre is that it takes two characters who have been done to death since the 1970s and brings them up to date. I recently tried to watch \"Superman: The Movie\" for the first time in a number of years, and while it was still good and Reeves will always be iconic, I just couldn't take it seriously. I'll put it this way: If the story in BvS was \"stupid\" in your view but Superman turning back time by spinning the earth backward on its axis didn't seem like one of the dumbest things you have ever seen -in any movie from any genre- to the extent that it outright ruins the movie for you, then your opinion about BvS isn't worth much. Nostalgic bias was always going to be a problem for this movie, and the way people reacted to and reviewed \"Man of Steel\" was telling in this regard.That brings me to Zack Snyder's take on Superman. You know, that guy whose status as the first extraterrestrial ever encountered by humanity was a total non-issue in the old movies. Apparently, Snyder has a similar view to my own in that his take on the Man of Steel makes his being an alien a core piece of his identity. He may look like any other (absurdly attractive) person, but he knows what he is, and that makes him perpetually uncertain of where he fits in this world. He is essentially good and really does care about people, but he struggles to truly empathize with the likes of us. To be human is to be frail, and that is not something he can easily relate to. This is the root of his conflict with Batman.Just as Clark struggles to genuinely relate to most people, Snyder's Batman either refuses to or otherwise just can't relate to Superman. He doesn't see him as anything but a threat regardless of Superman's clear good intentions. Remember, a small group of Kryptonians were able to bring humanity to the brink of extinction in less than a day, and Bruce Wayne is nothing if not a realist. He didn't know the guy from Kansas. He only knew the god from another world.While Batman's anger toward and fear of Superman are readily apparent from the start, Superman's inability to imagine things from Bruce Wayne's perspective only becomes truly apparent during their first real interaction. This reminded me of the animated version of the \"world's finest\" storyline, where Superman judges Batman harshly for using fear tactics and threats of violence (also, actual violence) to get the job done. Superman wasn't willing to consider what it would take for a human man to fight criminals and save innocents, or what that life would do to him over time. Just as Batman didn't see the guy from Kansas, Superman didn't see the man who lives his life trapped in one brutal, unthinkably traumatic moment (this was beautifully conveyed during the film's opening moments), and had spent his whole adult life bearing witness to humanity at its absolute worst.The conflict between these two characters is as old as human history. They want the same things, but they can't understand one another. So they fight. And what a fight it was.Watching a fight between, say, Captain America and Iron Man was, to me, more frustrating than anything because each understood the other's perspective perfectly. The fight between Batman and Superman in BvS was genuinely gut-wrenching, as intended, because they would have understood one another if either had tried. The whole sequence hilighted Batman's tactical prowess and ability to control a situation. Maybe the most badass thing about the fight was that it ended exactly where Batman planned. That brings me to the big elephant in the room named \"Martha.\"I can't recall exactly which YouTuber put it this way, but if you thought the \"save Martha\" exchange was about their mothers having the same name, you had your brain turned off. The brain-on people have explained this to death, but it bears repeating. This was the moment when Superman became humanized to Batman. He was about to die, and his only concern was for his adoptive human mother. He still believed that the man about to take his life would do the right thing. Even with the cowl on, there was no mistaking the look on Batman's face. It was the look of shame, guilt, and sudden uncertainty that says \"What am I doing?\" Turns out even the most brutal, angry version of Bruce Wayne is better than Tony Stark at knowing right from wrong. At knowing that he had gone too far.From there, the third act was a series of truly impressive (albeit mostly CGI) fight sequences, beginning with what I regard as the undisputed champion of Batman fights. Nothing in the Nolan movies (and especially nothing in the Burton movies) even came close. Go ahead, try to convince yourself that Batman and Bane taking turns punching one another in the face until Bane's mask broke was a good fight sequence. No, this was a fight straight out of \"Arkham Knight,\" and it was glorious. The battle against Doomsday really was one for the books. From the moment Wonder Woman arrived accompanied by the intense sounds of Tina Guo's electric cello to Superman's tragic, heroic death at the hands of Doomsday, I was glued to the screen. Sure, the mere presence of Doomsday spoiled the end to a degree, but watching the Man of Steel laboring to carry that kryptonite spear towards certain death was no less impactful. A brief word on Jesse Eisenberg's take on Lex Luthor. At least one other reviewer on this site already said it best when they pointed out that this was his origin story. If you consider his scheme objectively, he is actually one of the more formidable incarnations of the character. If we're lucky, we'll eventually get to see a Snyder Cut of \"Justice League\" and find out where this story was actually meant to go. For the record, Joss Whedon and Danny Elfman both should have said \"no\" to taking a dump on someone else's art."
"BATMAN V SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE brings a fantastic surprise to a smash-hit team-up with one of the worlds most beloved DC Comics' icons of all time. The movie delivers spectacular casting, and fantastic acting with different characters having their shine in each scenes.The story follows Clark Kent/Superman who becomes a threat, after the destruction in Metropolis in Man Of Steel.(2013). Batman/Bruce Wayne sees him as a threat and begins his war on Superman.The movie brings spectacular storytelling, it tells the complications of human against alien who are on the same side, and the first meeting of Batman and Superman. The story of Bruce Wayne, with his many years of The Caped Crusader, sends him on a spiral of \"out of control\", sheer anger, and builds tension to wanting to defeat the Man of Steel. Snyder has fantastically gave this storytelling an exciting nod to the comics.Lex Luthor, played by Jesse Einsberg, delivers a very interesting performance, but very differently by him showing is his \"origin\" before he becomes a bald foe to the Man of Steel. He shows that his love of \"god vs man\" terrorises mankind when he ultimately creates Doomsday, and Batman realises Superman's inner heroism.It packs so many great \"out of nowhere\" excitement, including a first-look of the fearful Wonder Woman a.k.a. Diana Prince, played by Gal Gadot, and a fresh-new glimpse of the superhero DC canon: The Justice League.WATCH THIS MOVIE! The critics are out of their mind. It's a fun-packed action adventure which still keeps the movie enjoyable until it's final minutes of the movie. It's a FANTASTIC MOVIE! BEN AFFLECK AS BATMAN... is Incredible!A 10/10 overall!"
"I want to go on record as saying that this is a truly thrilling cinematic experience in so many ways. If pressed, I guess I could acknowledge that there were a couple ... let's say \"clumsy\" moments. And in a film that runs to three hours, that hardly seems like a significant issue, certainly not enough to rate it with fewer than 9 stars.This film has everything. There is dramatic tension right from the start. There is a magnificent story arc that picks up quite seamlessly from 'Man of Steel' and propels the viewer not only into the life of Clark Kent/Superman but also of Bruce Wayne/Batman.The villain is no mere cartoon of a villain; he is truly thoroughly (and apparently irrevocably) diabolical. He is a psychopath, and you wish for his death over and over and over. You want Superman to reduce him to ash with the power of his eyes.I have read a number of viewers' reviews, and it seems that the people who disliked the film / gave it a low rating had rather unfair and unrealistic expectations of it. That is, their own prejudices about how the plot could/should unfold or what the character development could/should be, etc. ruined the film for them. And that is a shame.My thought is: I settle into my seat, wait for the lights to dim, and then I wait to be transported by the film. I accept it, lock, stock, and barrel.As another reviewer remarked, I love how the film begins from the point of view of Bruce Wayne as he is among people on the ground who have fallen victim to the attack of Zod and the other Kryptonians.Why would Bruce Wayne not like Superman? Why would the good people of Earth hurl insults at Superman and burn him in effigy (on the news)? Because the good people of Earth just got catapulted into a new reality in which there are not only extraterrestrial beings (surprise!) but they are also superman! And a group of them are hell-bent on destroying humankind and taking the planet for themselves.It is difficult to see Superman as separate from the whole Kryptonian Krew.It seems that many moviegoers forgot that Bruce Wayne is also human. Sure, he's a hero, but he is flawed.. Just like the rest of us. He is a vigilante, after all.He has let his vigilantism get the better of him. HE is actually the one working outside the boundaries of the law, not Superman. It is the clear head of Alfred that shows us that he has gone into a rather dark place, that he has not seen what is really going on (in Luthor's scheme), and so he chooses to embark on his own scheme scheme to take out the alien invader. He is (allegedly) thinking of the future: if he wipes out the all-powerful alien, then it can't turn on humankind in the future. At least, he convinces himself of that.A philosophical question is raised in the film: should Clark Kent have remained a simple man from Kansas and never have become the Superman? Should he just let people die and let calamities happen? The question is answered for us in the character of Diana Prince/Wonder Woman. She withdrew from mankind (her exact words) and just sat around watching. Watching while people died horrible deaths all around her. So, should Superman have done the same? Do these special beings, these 'metahumans', have some kind of moral imperative to intervene, or should they be allowed to be regular people, too? It seems that humans want it both ways.It seems that humans are saying: \"Don't be a superalien ... except when I and my friends and family are in trouble. Then come save us.\""

"Batman v Superman: Ultimate Edition: If your looking for a quick, cheap thrill then you might not enjoy this film at the time. This movies theatrical version was butchered by WB and in doing so reshaped the story leaving numerous plot holes. So the Ultimate Edition is the full story and the one worth seeing. Watch 'Man of Steel' before seeing this movie. There is much to claw through here, so much so that the audience might easily find themselves exhausted from the overall aggression of the film. However, a lot of the story does work. The action is good, and the emotion feels real most of the time.This film is about Superman trying to become Superman. Trying to help the world, save people, find a place in this world not as an outcast, and yet is looked at has a threat by many. Superman is not from this world, yet He is trying to be human, find a place in this world, be excepted by earths people, and come into his destiny.This film is also about Batman being Batman for 20 years and losing faith in humanity, and fearing Superman, what Superman can do with his powers. Great film, great plot, great visuals. ---Yidioo"
"I didn't see the film in the theaters and just bought the \"Extended Edition \" on Amazon. I never properly saw Man of Steel- i think I rented it and watched it when already exhausted and fell asleep. I saw the mediocre user reviews and horrible reviews from critics of this film.They really have it wrong. This is the very best either Batman or Superman. It has a different take, on things. Much darker then earlier films even darker then the Christopher Nolan Batman films.First of all Christopher Nolan is an Executive Producer. So how bad could it be? I loved Sucker Punch and Zack Snyder was involved with that. So how bad could this be? Hans Zimmer did the music, so how bad could it be?I remember watching the old Superman TV shows and reading the Superman and Batman comics as a little kid and loved them, but i wouldn't call myself a \"fan boy\" of comic universes, like so many younger people today. As an older adult I will admit my favorite TV show of all time was Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but watched it on DVD only after it had finished. I saw the second of the Dark Knight series in the theater, but the other two, I watched on DVD. They were great, but not my favorite films like so many people. i also loved the first couple Superman and Batman films in the older series. Regardless, i was not waiting with baited breath to see Man of Steel or this one.I'm more of a serious film fan, who can watch Stanley Kubrick films over and over and my favorite films in the last twenty years, are Eyes Wide Shut and Intersteller, both of which i've watched multiple times.So, with that said, take it from me, the critics have this film very wrong, just as critics hated 2001: A Space Odyssey when it first came out. This film will have lasting appreciation.Surprised how much I liked Ben Afleck's Batman. it was hard to get into Henry Cavil's scrawnier looking Superman, but it grew on me. Amy Adams was great as Lois Lane, The Gal Gadol Wonder Women was amazing. Lex Luther was terrific, like Nolan's Joker. Jeremy Irons was the best Alfred ever. Holly Hunter and Diane Lane was good too. The movie had bad reviews but made a billion dollars. Hopefully everyone buys the Ultimate Edition and it breaks sales records and the film is re-appreciated. I have no idea what scenes this Ultimate Edition added, but it is pretty perfect. Now I can't wait for Wonder Woman and the Justice League and as soon as I finish writing this am going to watch Man of Steal. I'm into it now!I can only surmise that the bad reviews stem from too much expectations of the rigid fan boy types and the radical changes in tone, we see in this film.Total masterpiece of cinema, but I have a few criticisms. There are a few hollow scenes of typical Idiot cops and authorities getting everything wrong in a cliché type way and it has a few filler scenes of that type and a few moments here and there that felt rushed and cheesy. Maybe not everything restored into the Ultimate Edition should have been. I wish there had been more Kevin Costner scenes."

"The whole entire Batman V Superman movie was great and yes even though it felt slow to the majority of the people who watched it but to me I enjoyed every part and every scene of Batman V Superman and when it got to the fight scenes both batman VS Superman and the Doomsday fight it brought so much drama, intensity, and epic performances. So with that being said I give this movie a good 10/10 because it really did go to my expectations and it brought a powerful performance and a powerful yet epic introduction to the upcoming Justice League."

"When I first wrote a review for this movie a year ago exclaiming my excitement for the film, I had been high off a fresh dose of live-action DC superheroes playing out the beloved comic book stories that I had grown up on. It was all playing out before my eyes and coming to life. After a few months had passed, I began to notice things about the movie that I disliked: little gaps in the story, things that didn't add up, etc. My original rating of a 10 / 10 dropped to an 8 /10. But today it has gone back up to a 10. The extended version of the film not only rectifies the gaps but also silences critics.Many claimed that the movie was too dark or that it just didn't make sense. To those people, I say: \"Pick up a comic book!\" Many of the critics of this particular film were part of the superhero bandwagon that formed when Marvel began its spree of Avengers-related films. In fact, its estimated that over 60% of people who go to see 'superhero' genre films have never picked up a comic book in their life. I would argue that similar numbers could figure to those which view the CW televised DC Universe shows. People complain that DC comics is just too dark but the fact is that these movies are based upon actual comics which are meant to be dark (ex: The Dark Knight Returns, Injustice, etc.). Its like complaining that Game of Thrones (the TV series) sucks because they kill off too many characters. Read the books! Its frustrating to see such a beautiful work of art like Batman V Superman criticized by those ignorant to its universe and its meaning. This movie is in fact a catalyst that opens numerous doorways and leaves true fans in awe of the possibilities for future movies. But regardless of whether or not people choose to educate themselves, this film's DVD/Blu-ray extended version puts the theater release to shame. All of the plot holes and gaps are filled in 30 minutes of extended footage scattered throughout the film. The movie ultimately becomes more complete and people will wish that the movie had shown the full 3 hours of footage in its theatrical debut. As a major DC comics fan, I will of course pick up on things that a comics fan would not, but someone who does not read comics would learn to appreciate this film in its entirety with the extended version. Get your hands on a copy today or find it on Netflix or the internet somewhere!"

"I ignored the bad reviews and watched anyways. This film had a lot to live up to after Civil War was released and I went into this film expecting the worst. It ended up to be the best Superhero film of 2016 to me. One complaint was that this film was more concerned about universe building than telling a great story than Civil War but for me it was the other way around; Civil War felt like a build up to something else and to be honest, I felt that way when I saw the other MCU films. Batman vs Superman however not only had a great story, but it also felt a lot more consistent than Civil War. This film was way more diverse with the cast than the MCU but unlike the MCU, I felt like this film doesn't go overboard with the SJW stuff like the MCU films or The Star Wars Sequel films do. The Visuals were AMAZING, The Score by Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL was AMAZING as well, The Tone is just right as I actually felt for the characters emotionally, The Cinematography kept my eyes glued to the screen, and the script felt really Intelligent and Complex and despite people calling the writing confusing, I was able to piece it together with no problem whatsoever. This film is similar to Empire Strikes back in terms of popularity so over time after the other movies are released, this movie would probably be more popular.This film was way better than I Expected and deserves another chance.

"Its shame to see what critics and marvel fans did to this movie and targeted Zack Snyder for it. I have seen this movie more than 25 times till date. And i enjoy this movie as much as i enjoyed the first time. The fans who have read DC comics, wouldn't be disappointed in this movie. Its dark movie, yes it is. Because the title shows the intense situation at hand. Two superheroes about to rip each other apart for whatever reasons that brought them to this stage. Yes it had to be dark and intense.Only marvel can be stupid enough to show an alien invasion where humans are loosing the battle and the super heroes are cracking jokes while battles as if they are playing ping pong. a person playing Call of Duty game is more serious while playing than the marvel heroes fighting aliens."

"Last week some news came out from somebody online who had claimed to have seen a finished version of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. If you were like me, you've been leery of checking it out because you weren't sure how much might actually be true. Now Zack Snyder has spoken out about the spoiler-filled post, although his response doesn't really clear anything up.In a word, to MTV, he called the post \"hilarious,which might imply that he's saying that it's mostly, if not entirely, untrue. That might be the case, but then again he could have just said it was untrue and he didn't say that. What he did say, however, is that he doesn't like spoilers. While this may seem odd for the director who's most recent trailer appeared to give away the entire movie, Snyder says that's not the case. Even if you've seen the trailer, you can rest easy, as there is much more we have not seen in then finished film. Says Snyder I have the benefit of seeing the movie. It's cool that think it's too much, and I appreciate people not wanting to know, but there's plenty that they don't know. There's a lot of movie that's not in the trailer. In the process of calling the Batman v Superman Reddit review hilarious, Snyder goes on to talk about how he hates it when spoilers come out. The director would much rather that fans see the movie mostly blind. While he understands that some fans may wish to find the answers before hand, he wants his movies to be mysteries going in. If you're, as an audience member, exploring these articles, looking for answers to questions that you have, maybe you're okay with knowing before you go. It's like an individual taste. But like I said, I want people to see the movie without knowing.Spoilers are a topic that mean different things to different people. While most try to avoid them to some degree, the need to solve the mystery is a nearly universal human experience. We have an inclination to want to know the truth, even while also wanting to be surprised. For most of us getting some information is good, but getting all the information is bad, of course, only getting the details that you want can be difficult."
"The theatrical is choppy, poorly edited, hard to follow, with some really good moments mixed in their. The extended is much more fluent and is much easier to follow, it does have a long runtime, which might make it seem a bit dragging on, but if you like long films done right, like Lord of the Rings, you will like this movie as long as you get into the characters and story. Speaking of which, the story starts out perfectly showing Bruce Wayne as a character, and it is very powerful. There are several moments in this movie that are powerful, emotional, and shocking. Characters. Batman is my favorite fictional character of all time, and believe me when I say, Ben Affleck as Batman was perfect, he had the charisma, the anger, and the look of being through some bad stuff Gal Gadot also does perfect as Wonder Woman, but if you want to really see how good she does, go watch the Wonder Woman movie. Henry Call as Superman. I really don't like it when people say Christopher Reeves is better. Don't get me wrong, Reeves does great, but can you imagine him as Superman in this movie? I wouldn't like it. It would be like Adam West playing Batman in The Dark Knight. Henry Cavill does great in this role, I can say everything about him as I said with Ben Affleck. Jesse Eisenberg as Luthor. I thought it was different in a good way. I've heard a criticism for him as being too much like Joker, but is that a bad thing? Joker is my favorite villain, so to see Superman have an enemy that crazy, but still hold the values Luthor needs to be Luthor, I think it is great. The thing I thought this movie was lacking in the first and second acts was humor, at least good humor. If there was more humor, I would've given this movie a ten because it would give a more relaxing feel to the parts that needed it. All in all though, this movie was awesome, it had powerful moments, it was badass, and just plain fun. It had a great story arc and does its job very well."

"*I will be talking about the Ultimate Edition of the film* This was one of the most anticipated CBM of all time. Ever since the arrival and subsequent success of Marvel's The Avengers people have wondered when will DC launch its own cinematic universe, one of the main reasons being the opportunity to finally see titans such as Batman and Superman share the screen together: the ultimate nerd dream. On 2016, the moment finally came for BvS to be released AND.. it performed poorly. Not only did critical reception left a lot to be desired, but fan reactions where surprisingly split after its cinematic debut. People either loved it and called Zack a genius, or hated it and called him a hack. Me, personally, I found myself with middle of the road feelings, for sure, but more leaning towards the negative side with subsequent viewings. The theatrical cut of the film showcased amazing performances, incredible visuals, and action set pieces that seemed like comic book panels come to life, in a good way. However, when it comes to its narrative structure and more technical aspects like editing, the film was seriously flawed. More plot holes than Age of Ultron, questionable character decisions, random editing that lacked cohesion and focus, and forced dramatic moments that lacked any impact because the attempts at character development ranged from limited to nonexistent, especially when it comes to Superman's character. I thought it was a 5/10 movie at best. As such, I was kind of skeptical about the idea of a 30 minute longer version. I say kind of because I know how Zack works. I remember Watchmen being vastly improved with its director's cut, so in a way I was expecting BvS to perform in a similar manner, but I also feared those 30 minutes wold be just there to amplify action and discredit storytelling issues. Oh boy, I'm so glad I was proved wrong. The ultimate cut of the film was infuriating, but not because it was awful, but because it questions the sanity of WB executives and editors and makes you wonder what were they thinking during the editing process. What I got out of the Ultimate Edition was a thought-provoking deconstruction of two very iconic superheroes that gave spotlight to the struggles both of them face when they aren't fighting crime. What I got was an extremely well produced character study on both Batman and Superman in a cynical world, a world dangerously close to our own. We meet Batman as a ruthless, worn out hero that has seen the failure behind his ideals and witnessed some truly horrifying things in his life. Superman, on the other hand, is portrayed as a godlike figure that seeks to do good in the world, but finds himself emotionally conflicted once he realized that every good deed he does leaves behind a trail of destruction (most of it due to Luthor's antics). In my opinion, this is a hugely original approach, one that distances itself from the rest of the competition and delivers a dark, somber, yet relevant superhero movie that understands both characters and gives them real human struggles to deal with. I felt invested in both of them, and hoped that by the end of the film both could find a way to redeem themselves. Their character arcs were very well established during the first two acts of the movie, and by the time we get to the titular climactic battle the emotion behind the jaw-dropping action is intensified. Lex Luthor as a villain was also given more time to develop with this new edition. One of the main criticisms with the original version was the fact that his plan relied too much on conveniences, and the character's mannerisms and mad-scientist attitude was annoying, and that goes without saying his motivations were unclear. Not only do we spend more time understanding his hate for any godlike figure and thus his hatred for Superman, but the added scenes allowed us to witness his entire plan come to fruition. It sells the cold, manipulative, calculating attributes of his comic counterpart. The acting is spot on. Every actor owns his/her role, from Cavill's Superman, to Ben Affleck as Batman, Eisenberg as Luthor, and Gadot as Wonder Woman, whose scenes are brief, but are more than enough to sell the strong and ferocious warrior that she is. Cinematography is stunning, and miles above that of Man of Steel's. And the soundtrack by Zimmer and Junkie XL? Perfect, just perfect. When it comes to flaws, the film still has some of those. The Martha moment, while serving as a pivotal character moment for Batman, felt off in execution, and its understandable that many people got mad at it. If your main complaint about BvS the first time around was its bleak tone and subject matter, this film is still not for you. I understand most were expecting to see the heroes being the most iconic versions of themselves, clashing in an elongated battle and evoking the same feelings The Avengers gave audiences back in 2012. In that sense, the film will remain divisive, but at least I have the comfort of saying that, at the very least, the film is competently made."

"This film was amazing. Ben Affleck was easily the best part of this movie, he brought his a-game as Batman. The chemistry between Affleck & Irons was outstanding. Gal Gadot did a great job as Wonder Woman. The fight between Batman & Superman was awesome. The final fight with Doomsday was outstanding in every way possible. However, there is only one problem with this film and that's Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor. He was sadly missed cast in this role, but then again it's really the fault of Warner Bros. Studios. Overall, this film deliver on almost every level. I highly recommend that you watch the extended version of this film."

"I know I know. I saw it in theaters too, and felt like it could've been so much better. While the Batman element was good, the narrative felt fractured, and the third act was just one long stunt scene. Superman was relegated to a supporting character, and other characters didn't get a chance to shine. And then I chanced on the ultimate cut. Calling it 30 mins of \"extra\" footage is unfair to Zack Snyder because it's exactly these 30 mins that makes the movie a worthy one. What I can say about the theatrical cut is this - It had the blockbuster elements - music, visuals, stunts, CGI. But, it lacked the human elements. The first 20 mins of the movie had it, but not after that. The extended cut in comparison has a flow to the narrative. There are no disjointed scenes, everything flows smoothly, and there's connective tissue. Superman gets to spend some time with his father, and mother. Clark Kent does some investigative journalism. Superman helps the people after the blast. Lois Lane doesn't jump to conclusions, she gets to the bottom of the crime. Lex Luthor apparently had a coherent plan - everything is explained pretty well. Wonder Woman was already good, so there's no change there :) Also, the \"Martha\" scene seems better executed, because it is a few seconds longer, and there's time to breathe it in. So, here's my take on this movie - The theatrical cut was junk. Get the Bluray for ultimate edition, and you shall not be disappointed. I've seen it so many more times now, and it's the definitive cut. It is the movie we deserve. It's a unique take on Batman, and Superman. It's a gritty take on the superhero movie genre, and definitely the best DCEU movie, and the best DC movie since The Dark Knight.P.S. Yes it's dark. We're adults, and we should appreciate mature film making without intentionally silly moments. It attempts to be philosophical, and something deep instead of just trying to make you chuckle."

"This is one of the best superhero movies ever made. Zack Snyder is a magician behind the camera.The reason behind so many complaints is the fact that Warner Bros. marketed this movie as a fight between Batman and Superman. That's not what it is. It's a movie about the origins of the Justice League.The cinematography, the acting and the score are all second to none. This film is phenomenal.P.S: watch the 3 hour extended cut that Snyder intended you to see, not the 2 and a half hour movie that Warner Bros. decided would be better for theaters."

"I don't care what the critics say, this is a very well-done movie. I'll start my review by listing what I like about the movie.1.) Ben Affleck is the best batman to me and it is not close. He pulls off the role of an aging batman extremely well. Also, Zack Snyder's vision of batman is legit. I have always hated batman up until this adaptation of him. Instead of being a conflicted and idealistic batman, this batman is dark, gritty, and 100% a badass. His equipment is decked out with machine guns and he has no aversion to killing people. In fact, he probably kills about 50 criminal by the time this movie is over. The warehouse scene is the coolest batman scene in any movie.2.) The development of a grudge between batman and superman is pulled off flawlessly. It actually makes sense why batman dislikes superman. Then, when they do fight it is about the coolest thing you can expect to see from a superhero film. 3.) I disagree with a lot of people about Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor. In my opinion, he played his role to perfection. 4.) B v S sets up Wonder Woman and Justice League with Gal Gadot's cameo as Wonder Woman and short clips of Aquaman, the Flash, and Cyborg. B v S is one of my favorite superhero films and rewatching it never gets old."

"The theatrical cut of this film is garbage which is why I rated it eight stars instead of nine. The first time I watched this film I didn't like it (not straight out hate but didn't like). Character motivations didn't make any sense, Lex was annoying as s***, editing was sloppy, and it was overly dark and broody for an action superhero movie. A year + a half, five Marvel films, a ton of bad reviews and a Justice League later a thought popped into my head: \"what if I watched BVS again\". This time I didn't have trailers ruining the best moments, I only vaguely remembered the film, and I was conditioned to look at it negatively but something unexpected happened: I actually loved it. Superman was just a normal person that tried to make a difference cause he could that others imposed their own beliefs on. Lex Luthor was a genius that couldn't stand his powerlessness compared to Superman or more accurately a super being. As Alfred said \"The fever, the rage, the feeling of powerlessness that turns good men... cruel\" and you see the same thought process in Batman. Batman, just like Lex Luthor feels powerless in the midst of a god-being and just like Lex he attempts to destroy him so he can get his sense of power back but unlike Lex, Batman learns something. I what is one of the corniest lines of the movie Superman says, \"Martha\" when he knows he can't win against Batman in a late desperate attempt to save his mother. Not only does this name connect with Bruce Wayne but it also shows what really matters to a man of steel: it isn't power, it isn't fame or anything else, it is his Mother and on a broader scale it is people. Lex (who doesn't care about people at all) knows he doesn't have the power so he creates something from his blood and the remains of Zod: A Doomsday for Superman. Not only does this film have depth but it also doesn't always explain it to you which is rare in a blockbuster action superhero flick normally cater to semi-comic book fans and people that want to shove popcorn in their mouths. This film rewards you for really noticing the details while still having massive explosions. One of my favorites is how Lex has all of Batman's branded killed which is why he isn't afraid of the branding at the end or Grandma's Peach Tea as a way of scaring the s*** out of someone. Of course, this film isn't perfect and I do have personal dislikes. The Batman V Superman fight was slow and pretty boring especially after watching such an amazing fight in Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 2 (If you haven't watched the animated Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 1 and 2 you are sorely missing out on something fantastic). Also, the addition of Wonder Woman who pretty much steals a hacker thing, gives it back and then suits up and fights against a giant monster thing. Not to say I don't like Wonder Woman (She is one of my favorite Superheroes of all time who showed not only can woman kick a** but they also don't need to be ashamed of their sexuality or gender) but she wasn't really that helpful to the plot and just brought in to expand the universe which was well done through Lex's superhuman hunting files. Also, the post-apocalyptic scene that was just a dream could have been cut but nothing is perfect except movies like Citizen Kane which isn't a lot of fun to watch cause it is too perfect. So to summarize, the theatrical cut is bad, the ultimate cut is Amazing and the other cut is meh. Please give it a second chance because it deserves it and save a good director from losing grace because of something he didn't do."
"I really liked it, don't know what all the hate is about. I'm actually a Marvel fan from when I was 7 or so, but Superman and Batman together in 1 movie? Just great. And personally I like Ben Affleck even better than Christian Bale as Batman. So just watch and enjoy, I know I did!"

"That's right. We have been waiting for these two heroes to finally meet and fight against each other. This movie is so good in both plot and special effects.Henry Cavill and Ben Affleck have performed well in their acting stages. They are the best superhero actors and they have filmed their fighting scenes very well. The movie starts to show the conflict between the lives of the heroes and now they have blamed each other for it. This movie is amazing and sets up a good plot for Dawn Justice."

"Actually...I didn't know what to expect. When you see Wonder Woman, you know it will be off of Wonder Woman and off of a Wonder Woman story, but with Batman V Superman, I was like, \"hmmmm, so who is this about?\" It was pretty obvious that it would feature many characters, but I thought the introduction to Batman was amazing. Ben Affleck nailed the part, not only as Batman but also as Bruce Wayne. He is my Batman. Henry Cavill continued to be super as the Man of Steel. And he is my Super - Man. A dark story? Yes, without a doubt. Could it have had a few more jokes? Sure. But not all movies or stories need to have jokes when certain events are serious. I really hope people can see this review and take another look at the movie, because, I loved it. I really hope the ratings can go up, eventually. And P.S, this movie is the perfect set up to Justice League."

"I'll start by making it clear I have only ever seen the Ultimate Edition. I'm aware of what was cut out for the theatrical release, so I will concede up front that most of the criticisms about pacing, editing, and missing bits of plot at release were merited.With that caveat out of the way, I must reiterate that this was bar-none the boldest superhero movie I have ever seen. To me, it was arguably the best as well, though \"best\" shouldn't be taken to mean \"most enjoyable.\" That honor easily goes to \"Thor: Ragnarok.\" What makes BvS stand out among other films in the genre is that it takes two characters who have been done to death since the 1970s and brings them up to date. I recently tried to watch \"Superman: The Movie\" for the first time in a number of years, and while it was still good and Reeves will always be iconic, I just couldn't take it seriously. I'll put it this way: If the story in BvS was \"stupid\" in your view but Superman turning back time by spinning the earth backward on its axis didn't seem like one of the dumbest things you have ever seen -in any movie from any genre- to the extent that it outright ruins the movie for you, then your opinion about BvS isn't worth much. Nostalgic bias was always going to be a problem for this movie, and the way people reacted to and reviewed \"Man of Steel\" was telling in this regard.That brings me to Zack Snyder's take on Superman. You know, that guy whose status as the first extraterrestrial ever encountered by humanity was a total non-issue in the old movies. Apparently, Snyder has a similar view to my own in that his take on the Man of Steel makes his being an alien a core piece of his identity. He may look like any other (absurdly attractive) person, but he knows what he is, and that makes him perpetually uncertain of where he fits in this world. He is essentially good and really does care about people, but he struggles to truly empathize with the likes of us. To be human is to be frail, and that is not something he can easily relate to. This is the root of his conflict with Batman.Just as Clark struggles to genuinely relate to most people, Snyder's Batman either refuses to or otherwise just can't relate to Superman. He doesn't see him as anything but a threat regardless of Superman's clear good intentions. Remember, a small group of Kryptonians were able to bring humanity to the brink of extinction in less than a day, and Bruce Wayne is nothing if not a realist. He didn't know the guy from Kansas. He only knew the god from another world.While Batman's anger toward and fear of Superman are readily apparent from the start, Superman's inability to imagine things from Bruce Wayne's perspective only becomes truly apparent during their first real interaction. This reminded me of the animated version of the \"world's finest\" storyline, where Superman judges Batman harshly for using fear tactics and threats of violence (also, actual violence) to get the job done. Superman wasn't willing to consider what it would take for a human man to fight criminals and save innocents, or what that life would do to him over time. Just as Batman didn't see the guy from Kansas, Superman didn't see the man who lives his life trapped in one brutal, unthinkably traumatic moment (this was beautifully conveyed during the film's opening moments), and had spent his whole adult life bearing witness to humanity at its absolute worst.The conflict between these two characters is as old as human history. They want the same things, but they can't understand one another. So they fight. And what a fight it was.Watching a fight between, say, Captain America and Iron Man was, to me, more frustrating than anything because each understood the other's perspective perfectly. The fight between Batman and Superman in BvS was genuinely gut-wrenching, as intended, because they would have understood one another if either had tried. The whole sequence hilighted Batman's tactical prowess and ability to control a situation. Maybe the most badass thing about the fight was that it ended exactly where Batman planned. That brings me to the big elephant in the room named \"Martha.\"I can't recall exactly which YouTuber put it this way, but if you thought the \"save Martha\" exchange was about their mothers having the same name, you had your brain turned off. The brain-on people have explained this to death, but it bears repeating. This was the moment when Superman became humanized to Batman. He was about to die, and his only concern was for his adoptive human mother. He still believed that the man about to take his life would do the right thing. Even with the cowl on, there was no mistaking the look on Batman's face. It was the look of shame, guilt, and sudden uncertainty that says \"What am I doing?\" Turns out even the most brutal, angry version of Bruce Wayne is better than Tony Stark at knowing right from wrong. At knowing that he had gone too far.From there, the third act was a series of truly impressive (albeit mostly CGI) fight sequences, beginning with what I regard as the undisputed champion of Batman fights. Nothing in the Nolan movies (and especially nothing in the Burton movies) even came close. Go ahead, try to convince yourself that Batman and Bane taking turns punching one another in the face until Bane's mask broke was a good fight sequence. No, this was a fight straight out of \"Arkham Knight,\" and it was glorious. The battle against Doomsday really was one for the books. From the moment Wonder Woman arrived accompanied by the intense sounds of Tina Guo's electric cello to Superman's tragic, heroic death at the hands of Doomsday, I was glued to the screen. Sure, the mere presence of Doomsday spoiled the end to a degree, but watching the Man of Steel laboring to carry that kryptonite spear towards certain death was no less impactful. A brief word on Jesse Eisenberg's take on Lex Luthor. At least one other reviewer on this site already said it best when they pointed out that this was his origin story. If you consider his scheme objectively, he is actually one of the more formidable incarnations of the character. If we're lucky, we'll eventually get to see a Snyder Cut of \"Justice League\" and find out where this story was actually meant to go. For the record, Joss Whedon and Danny Elfman both should have said \"no\" to taking a dump on someone else's art."
"BATMAN V SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE brings a fantastic surprise to a smash-hit team-up with one of the worlds most beloved DC Comics' icons of all time. The movie delivers spectacular casting, and fantastic acting with different characters having their shine in each scenes.The story follows Clark Kent/Superman who becomes a threat, after the destruction in Metropolis in Man Of Steel.(2013). Batman/Bruce Wayne sees him as a threat and begins his war on Superman.The movie brings spectacular storytelling, it tells the complications of human against alien who are on the same side, and the first meeting of Batman and Superman. The story of Bruce Wayne, with his many years of The Caped Crusader, sends him on a spiral of \"out of control\", sheer anger, and builds tension to wanting to defeat the Man of Steel. Snyder has fantastically gave this storytelling an exciting nod to the comics.Lex Luthor, played by Jesse Einsberg, delivers a very interesting performance, but very differently by him showing is his \"origin\" before he becomes a bald foe to the Man of Steel. He shows that his love of \"god vs man\" terrorises mankind when he ultimately creates Doomsday, and Batman realises Superman's inner heroism.It packs so many great \"out of nowhere\" excitement, including a first-look of the fearful Wonder Woman a.k.a. Diana Prince, played by Gal Gadot, and a fresh-new glimpse of the superhero DC canon: The Justice League.WATCH THIS MOVIE! The critics are out of their mind. It's a fun-packed action adventure which still keeps the movie enjoyable until it's final minutes of the movie. It's a FANTASTIC MOVIE! BEN AFFLECK AS BATMAN... is Incredible!A 10/10 overall!"
"I want to go on record as saying that this is a truly thrilling cinematic experience in so many ways. If pressed, I guess I could acknowledge that there were a couple ... let's say \"clumsy\" moments. And in a film that runs to three hours, that hardly seems like a significant issue, certainly not enough to rate it with fewer than 9 stars.This film has everything. There is dramatic tension right from the start. There is a magnificent story arc that picks up quite seamlessly from 'Man of Steel' and propels the viewer not only into the life of Clark Kent/Superman but also of Bruce Wayne/Batman.The villain is no mere cartoon of a villain; he is truly thoroughly (and apparently irrevocably) diabolical. He is a psychopath, and you wish for his death over and over and over. You want Superman to reduce him to ash with the power of his eyes.I have read a number of viewers' reviews, and it seems that the people who disliked the film / gave it a low rating had rather unfair and unrealistic expectations of it. That is, their own prejudices about how the plot could/should unfold or what the character development could/should be, etc. ruined the film for them. And that is a shame.My thought is: I settle into my seat, wait for the lights to dim, and then I wait to be transported by the film. I accept it, lock, stock, and barrel.As another reviewer remarked, I love how the film begins from the point of view of Bruce Wayne as he is among people on the ground who have fallen victim to the attack of Zod and the other Kryptonians.Why would Bruce Wayne not like Superman? Why would the good people of Earth hurl insults at Superman and burn him in effigy (on the news)? Because the good people of Earth just got catapulted into a new reality in which there are not only extraterrestrial beings (surprise!) but they are also superman! And a group of them are hell-bent on destroying humankind and taking the planet for themselves.It is difficult to see Superman as separate from the whole Kryptonian Krew.It seems that many moviegoers forgot that Bruce Wayne is also human. Sure, he's a hero, but he is flawed.. Just like the rest of us. He is a vigilante, after all.He has let his vigilantism get the better of him. HE is actually the one working outside the boundaries of the law, not Superman. It is the clear head of Alfred that shows us that he has gone into a rather dark place, that he has not seen what is really going on (in Luthor's scheme), and so he chooses to embark on his own scheme scheme to take out the alien invader. He is (allegedly) thinking of the future: if he wipes out the all-powerful alien, then it can't turn on humankind in the future. At least, he convinces himself of that.A philosophical question is raised in the film: should Clark Kent have remained a simple man from Kansas and never have become the Superman? Should he just let people die and let calamities happen? The question is answered for us in the character of Diana Prince/Wonder Woman. She withdrew from mankind (her exact words) and just sat around watching. Watching while people died horrible deaths all around her. So, should Superman have done the same? Do these special beings, these 'metahumans', have some kind of moral imperative to intervene, or should they be allowed to be regular people, too? It seems that humans want it both ways.It seems that humans are saying: \"Don't be a superalien ... except when I and my friends and family are in trouble. Then come save us.\""

"Batman v Superman: Ultimate Edition: If your looking for a quick, cheap thrill then you might not enjoy this film at the time. This movies theatrical version was butchered by WB and in doing so reshaped the story leaving numerous plot holes. So the Ultimate Edition is the full story and the one worth seeing. Watch 'Man of Steel' before seeing this movie. There is much to claw through here, so much so that the audience might easily find themselves exhausted from the overall aggression of the film. However, a lot of the story does work. The action is good, and the emotion feels real most of the time.This film is about Superman trying to become Superman. Trying to help the world, save people, find a place in this world not as an outcast, and yet is looked at has a threat by many. Superman is not from this world, yet He is trying to be human, find a place in this world, be excepted by earths people, and come into his destiny.This film is also about Batman being Batman for 20 years and losing faith in humanity, and fearing Superman, what Superman can do with his powers. Great film, great plot, great visuals. ---Yidioo"
"I didn't see the film in the theaters and just bought the \"Extended Edition \" on Amazon. I never properly saw Man of Steel- i think I rented it and watched it when already exhausted and fell asleep. I saw the mediocre user reviews and horrible reviews from critics of this film.They really have it wrong. This is the very best either Batman or Superman. It has a different take, on things. Much darker then earlier films even darker then the Christopher Nolan Batman films.First of all Christopher Nolan is an Executive Producer. So how bad could it be? I loved Sucker Punch and Zack Snyder was involved with that. So how bad could this be? Hans Zimmer did the music, so how bad could it be?I remember watching the old Superman TV shows and reading the Superman and Batman comics as a little kid and loved them, but i wouldn't call myself a \"fan boy\" of comic universes, like so many younger people today. As an older adult I will admit my favorite TV show of all time was Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but watched it on DVD only after it had finished. I saw the second of the Dark Knight series in the theater, but the other two, I watched on DVD. They were great, but not my favorite films like so many people. i also loved the first couple Superman and Batman films in the older series. Regardless, i was not waiting with baited breath to see Man of Steel or this one.I'm more of a serious film fan, who can watch Stanley Kubrick films over and over and my favorite films in the last twenty years, are Eyes Wide Shut and Intersteller, both of which i've watched multiple times.So, with that said, take it from me, the critics have this film very wrong, just as critics hated 2001: A Space Odyssey when it first came out. This film will have lasting appreciation.Surprised how much I liked Ben Afleck's Batman. it was hard to get into Henry Cavil's scrawnier looking Superman, but it grew on me. Amy Adams was great as Lois Lane, The Gal Gadol Wonder Women was amazing. Lex Luther was terrific, like Nolan's Joker. Jeremy Irons was the best Alfred ever. Holly Hunter and Diane Lane was good too. The movie had bad reviews but made a billion dollars. Hopefully everyone buys the Ultimate Edition and it breaks sales records and the film is re-appreciated. I have no idea what scenes this Ultimate Edition added, but it is pretty perfect. Now I can't wait for Wonder Woman and the Justice League and as soon as I finish writing this am going to watch Man of Steal. I'm into it now!I can only surmise that the bad reviews stem from too much expectations of the rigid fan boy types and the radical changes in tone, we see in this film.Total masterpiece of cinema, but I have a few criticisms. There are a few hollow scenes of typical Idiot cops and authorities getting everything wrong in a cliché type way and it has a few filler scenes of that type and a few moments here and there that felt rushed and cheesy. Maybe not everything restored into the Ultimate Edition should have been. I wish there had been more Kevin Costner scenes."

"The whole entire Batman V Superman movie was great and yes even though it felt slow to the majority of the people who watched it but to me I enjoyed every part and every scene of Batman V Superman and when it got to the fight scenes both batman VS Superman and the Doomsday fight it brought so much drama, intensity, and epic performances. So with that being said I give this movie a good 10/10 because it really did go to my expectations and it brought a powerful performance and a powerful yet epic introduction to the upcoming Justice League."

"When I first wrote a review for this movie a year ago exclaiming my excitement for the film, I had been high off a fresh dose of live-action DC superheroes playing out the beloved comic book stories that I had grown up on. It was all playing out before my eyes and coming to life. After a few months had passed, I began to notice things about the movie that I disliked: little gaps in the story, things that didn't add up, etc. My original rating of a 10 / 10 dropped to an 8 /10. But today it has gone back up to a 10. The extended version of the film not only rectifies the gaps but also silences critics.Many claimed that the movie was too dark or that it just didn't make sense. To those people, I say: \"Pick up a comic book!\" Many of the critics of this particular film were part of the superhero bandwagon that formed when Marvel began its spree of Avengers-related films. In fact, its estimated that over 60% of people who go to see 'superhero' genre films have never picked up a comic book in their life. I would argue that similar numbers could figure to those which view the CW televised DC Universe shows. People complain that DC comics is just too dark but the fact is that these movies are based upon actual comics which are meant to be dark (ex: The Dark Knight Returns, Injustice, etc.). Its like complaining that Game of Thrones (the TV series) sucks because they kill off too many characters. Read the books! Its frustrating to see such a beautiful work of art like Batman V Superman criticized by those ignorant to its universe and its meaning. This movie is in fact a catalyst that opens numerous doorways and leaves true fans in awe of the possibilities for future movies. But regardless of whether or not people choose to educate themselves, this film's DVD/Blu-ray extended version puts the theater release to shame. All of the plot holes and gaps are filled in 30 minutes of extended footage scattered throughout the film. The movie ultimately becomes more complete and people will wish that the movie had shown the full 3 hours of footage in its theatrical debut. As a major DC comics fan, I will of course pick up on things that a comics fan would not, but someone who does not read comics would learn to appreciate this film in its entirety with the extended version. Get your hands on a copy today or find it on Netflix or the internet somewhere!"

"I ignored the bad reviews and watched anyways. This film had a lot to live up to after Civil War was released and I went into this film expecting the worst. It ended up to be the best Superhero film of 2016 to me. One complaint was that this film was more concerned about universe building than telling a great story than Civil War but for me it was the other way around; Civil War felt like a build up to something else and to be honest, I felt that way when I saw the other MCU films. Batman vs Superman however not only had a great story, but it also felt a lot more consistent than Civil War. This film was way more diverse with the cast than the MCU but unlike the MCU, I felt like this film doesn't go overboard with the SJW stuff like the MCU films or The Star Wars Sequel films do. The Visuals were AMAZING, The Score by Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL was AMAZING as well, The Tone is just right as I actually felt for the characters emotionally, The Cinematography kept my eyes glued to the screen, and the script felt really Intelligent and Complex and despite people calling the writing confusing, I was able to piece it together with no problem whatsoever. This film is similar to Empire Strikes back in terms of popularity so over time after the other movies are released, this movie would probably be more popular.This film was way better than I Expected and deserves another chance.

"Its shame to see what critics and marvel fans did to this movie and targeted Zack Snyder for it. I have seen this movie more than 25 times till date. And i enjoy this movie as much as i enjoyed the first time. The fans who have read DC comics, wouldn't be disappointed in this movie. Its dark movie, yes it is. Because the title shows the intense situation at hand. Two superheroes about to rip each other apart for whatever reasons that brought them to this stage. Yes it had to be dark and intense.Only marvel can be stupid enough to show an alien invasion where humans are loosing the battle and the super heroes are cracking jokes while battles as if they are playing ping pong. a person playing Call of Duty game is more serious while playing than the marvel heroes fighting aliens."

"Last week some news came out from somebody online who had claimed to have seen a finished version of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. If you were like me, you've been leery of checking it out because you weren't sure how much might actually be true. Now Zack Snyder has spoken out about the spoiler-filled post, although his response doesn't really clear anything up.In a word, to MTV, he called the post \"hilarious,which might imply that he's saying that it's mostly, if not entirely, untrue. That might be the case, but then again he could have just said it was untrue and he didn't say that. What he did say, however, is that he doesn't like spoilers. While this may seem odd for the director who's most recent trailer appeared to give away the entire movie, Snyder says that's not the case. Even if you've seen the trailer, you can rest easy, as there is much more we have not seen in then finished film. Says Snyder I have the benefit of seeing the movie. It's cool that think it's too much, and I appreciate people not wanting to know, but there's plenty that they don't know. There's a lot of movie that's not in the trailer. In the process of calling the Batman v Superman Reddit review hilarious, Snyder goes on to talk about how he hates it when spoilers come out. The director would much rather that fans see the movie mostly blind. While he understands that some fans may wish to find the answers before hand, he wants his movies to be mysteries going in. If you're, as an audience member, exploring these articles, looking for answers to questions that you have, maybe you're okay with knowing before you go. It's like an individual taste. But like I said, I want people to see the movie without knowing.Spoilers are a topic that mean different things to different people. While most try to avoid them to some degree, the need to solve the mystery is a nearly universal human experience. We have an inclination to want to know the truth, even while also wanting to be surprised. For most of us getting some information is good, but getting all the information is bad, of course, only getting the details that you want can be difficult."
"The theatrical is choppy, poorly edited, hard to follow, with some really good moments mixed in their. The extended is much more fluent and is much easier to follow, it does have a long runtime, which might make it seem a bit dragging on, but if you like long films done right, like Lord of the Rings, you will like this movie as long as you get into the characters and story. Speaking of which, the story starts out perfectly showing Bruce Wayne as a character, and it is very powerful. There are several moments in this movie that are powerful, emotional, and shocking. Characters. Batman is my favorite fictional character of all time, and believe me when I say, Ben Affleck as Batman was perfect, he had the charisma, the anger, and the look of being through some bad stuff Gal Gadot also does perfect as Wonder Woman, but if you want to really see how good she does, go watch the Wonder Woman movie. Henry Call as Superman. I really don't like it when people say Christopher Reeves is better. Don't get me wrong, Reeves does great, but can you imagine him as Superman in this movie? I wouldn't like it. It would be like Adam West playing Batman in The Dark Knight. Henry Cavill does great in this role, I can say everything about him as I said with Ben Affleck. Jesse Eisenberg as Luthor. I thought it was different in a good way. I've heard a criticism for him as being too much like Joker, but is that a bad thing? Joker is my favorite villain, so to see Superman have an enemy that crazy, but still hold the values Luthor needs to be Luthor, I think it is great. The thing I thought this movie was lacking in the first and second acts was humor, at least good humor. If there was more humor, I would've given this movie a ten because it would give a more relaxing feel to the parts that needed it. All in all though, this movie was awesome, it had powerful moments, it was badass, and just plain fun. It had a great story arc and does its job very well."

"*I will be talking about the Ultimate Edition of the film* This was one of the most anticipated CBM of all time. Ever since the arrival and subsequent success of Marvel's The Avengers people have wondered when will DC launch its own cinematic universe, one of the main reasons being the opportunity to finally see titans such as Batman and Superman share the screen together: the ultimate nerd dream. On 2016, the moment finally came for BvS to be released AND.. it performed poorly. Not only did critical reception left a lot to be desired, but fan reactions where surprisingly split after its cinematic debut. People either loved it and called Zack a genius, or hated it and called him a hack. Me, personally, I found myself with middle of the road feelings, for sure, but more leaning towards the negative side with subsequent viewings. The theatrical cut of the film showcased amazing performances, incredible visuals, and action set pieces that seemed like comic book panels come to life, in a good way. However, when it comes to its narrative structure and more technical aspects like editing, the film was seriously flawed. More plot holes than Age of Ultron, questionable character decisions, random editing that lacked cohesion and focus, and forced dramatic moments that lacked any impact because the attempts at character development ranged from limited to nonexistent, especially when it comes to Superman's character. I thought it was a 5/10 movie at best. As such, I was kind of skeptical about the idea of a 30 minute longer version. I say kind of because I know how Zack works. I remember Watchmen being vastly improved with its director's cut, so in a way I was expecting BvS to perform in a similar manner, but I also feared those 30 minutes wold be just there to amplify action and discredit storytelling issues. Oh boy, I'm so glad I was proved wrong. The ultimate cut of the film was infuriating, but not because it was awful, but because it questions the sanity of WB executives and editors and makes you wonder what were they thinking during the editing process. What I got out of the Ultimate Edition was a thought-provoking deconstruction of two very iconic superheroes that gave spotlight to the struggles both of them face when they aren't fighting crime. What I got was an extremely well produced character study on both Batman and Superman in a cynical world, a world dangerously close to our own. We meet Batman as a ruthless, worn out hero that has seen the failure behind his ideals and witnessed some truly horrifying things in his life. Superman, on the other hand, is portrayed as a godlike figure that seeks to do good in the world, but finds himself emotionally conflicted once he realized that every good deed he does leaves behind a trail of destruction (most of it due to Luthor's antics). In my opinion, this is a hugely original approach, one that distances itself from the rest of the competition and delivers a dark, somber, yet relevant superhero movie that understands both characters and gives them real human struggles to deal with. I felt invested in both of them, and hoped that by the end of the film both could find a way to redeem themselves. Their character arcs were very well established during the first two acts of the movie, and by the time we get to the titular climactic battle the emotion behind the jaw-dropping action is intensified. Lex Luthor as a villain was also given more time to develop with this new edition. One of the main criticisms with the original version was the fact that his plan relied too much on conveniences, and the character's mannerisms and mad-scientist attitude was annoying, and that goes without saying his motivations were unclear. Not only do we spend more time understanding his hate for any godlike figure and thus his hatred for Superman, but the added scenes allowed us to witness his entire plan come to fruition. It sells the cold, manipulative, calculating attributes of his comic counterpart. The acting is spot on. Every actor owns his/her role, from Cavill's Superman, to Ben Affleck as Batman, Eisenberg as Luthor, and Gadot as Wonder Woman, whose scenes are brief, but are more than enough to sell the strong and ferocious warrior that she is. Cinematography is stunning, and miles above that of Man of Steel's. And the soundtrack by Zimmer and Junkie XL? Perfect, just perfect. When it comes to flaws, the film still has some of those. The Martha moment, while serving as a pivotal character moment for Batman, felt off in execution, and its understandable that many people got mad at it. If your main complaint about BvS the first time around was its bleak tone and subject matter, this film is still not for you. I understand most were expecting to see the heroes being the most iconic versions of themselves, clashing in an elongated battle and evoking the same feelings The Avengers gave audiences back in 2012. In that sense, the film will remain divisive, but at least I have the comfort of saying that, at the very least, the film is competently made."

"This film was amazing. Ben Affleck was easily the best part of this movie, he brought his a-game as Batman. The chemistry between Affleck & Irons was outstanding. Gal Gadot did a great job as Wonder Woman. The fight between Batman & Superman was awesome. The final fight with Doomsday was outstanding in every way possible. However, there is only one problem with this film and that's Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor. He was sadly missed cast in this role, but then again it's really the fault of Warner Bros. Studios. Overall, this film deliver on almost every level. I highly recommend that you watch the extended version of this film."

"I know I know. I saw it in theaters too, and felt like it could've been so much better. While the Batman element was good, the narrative felt fractured, and the third act was just one long stunt scene. Superman was relegated to a supporting character, and other characters didn't get a chance to shine. And then I chanced on the ultimate cut. Calling it 30 mins of \"extra\" footage is unfair to Zack Snyder because it's exactly these 30 mins that makes the movie a worthy one. What I can say about the theatrical cut is this - It had the blockbuster elements - music, visuals, stunts, CGI. But, it lacked the human elements. The first 20 mins of the movie had it, but not after that. The extended cut in comparison has a flow to the narrative. There are no disjointed scenes, everything flows smoothly, and there's connective tissue. Superman gets to spend some time with his father, and mother. Clark Kent does some investigative journalism. Superman helps the people after the blast. Lois Lane doesn't jump to conclusions, she gets to the bottom of the crime. Lex Luthor apparently had a coherent plan - everything is explained pretty well. Wonder Woman was already good, so there's no change there :) Also, the \"Martha\" scene seems better executed, because it is a few seconds longer, and there's time to breathe it in. So, here's my take on this movie - The theatrical cut was junk. Get the Bluray for ultimate edition, and you shall not be disappointed. I've seen it so many more times now, and it's the definitive cut. It is the movie we deserve. It's a unique take on Batman, and Superman. It's a gritty take on the superhero movie genre, and definitely the best DCEU movie, and the best DC movie since The Dark Knight.P.S. Yes it's dark. We're adults, and we should appreciate mature film making without intentionally silly moments. It attempts to be philosophical, and something deep instead of just trying to make you chuckle."

"This is one of the best superhero movies ever made. Zack Snyder is a magician behind the camera.The reason behind so many complaints is the fact that Warner Bros. marketed this movie as a fight between Batman and Superman. That's not what it is. It's a movie about the origins of the Justice League.The cinematography, the acting and the score are all second to none. This film is phenomenal.P.S: watch the 3 hour extended cut that Snyder intended you to see, not the 2 and a half hour movie that Warner Bros. decided would be better for theaters."

"I don't care what the critics say, this is a very well-done movie. I'll start my review by listing what I like about the movie.1.) Ben Affleck is the best batman to me and it is not close. He pulls off the role of an aging batman extremely well. Also, Zack Snyder's vision of batman is legit. I have always hated batman up until this adaptation of him. Instead of being a conflicted and idealistic batman, this batman is dark, gritty, and 100% a badass. His equipment is decked out with machine guns and he has no aversion to killing people. In fact, he probably kills about 50 criminal by the time this movie is over. The warehouse scene is the coolest batman scene in any movie.2.) The development of a grudge between batman and superman is pulled off flawlessly. It actually makes sense why batman dislikes superman. Then, when they do fight it is about the coolest thing you can expect to see from a superhero film. 3.) I disagree with a lot of people about Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor. In my opinion, he played his role to perfection. 4.) B v S sets up Wonder Woman and Justice League with Gal Gadot's cameo as Wonder Woman and short clips of Aquaman, the Flash, and Cyborg. B v S is one of my favorite superhero films and rewatching it never gets old."

"The theatrical cut of this film is garbage which is why I rated it eight stars instead of nine. The first time I watched this film I didn't like it (not straight out hate but didn't like). Character motivations didn't make any sense, Lex was annoying as s***, editing was sloppy, and it was overly dark and broody for an action superhero movie. A year + a half, five Marvel films, a ton of bad reviews and a Justice League later a thought popped into my head: \"what if I watched BVS again\". This time I didn't have trailers ruining the best moments, I only vaguely remembered the film, and I was conditioned to look at it negatively but something unexpected happened: I actually loved it. Superman was just a normal person that tried to make a difference cause he could that others imposed their own beliefs on. Lex Luthor was a genius that couldn't stand his powerlessness compared to Superman or more accurately a super being. As Alfred said \"The fever, the rage, the feeling of powerlessness that turns good men... cruel\" and you see the same thought process in Batman. Batman, just like Lex Luthor feels powerless in the midst of a god-being and just like Lex he attempts to destroy him so he can get his sense of power back but unlike Lex, Batman learns something. I what is one of the corniest lines of the movie Superman says, \"Martha\" when he knows he can't win against Batman in a late desperate attempt to save his mother. Not only does this name connect with Bruce Wayne but it also shows what really matters to a man of steel: it isn't power, it isn't fame or anything else, it is his Mother and on a broader scale it is people. Lex (who doesn't care about people at all) knows he doesn't have the power so he creates something from his blood and the remains of Zod: A Doomsday for Superman. Not only does this film have depth but it also doesn't always explain it to you which is rare in a blockbuster action superhero flick normally cater to semi-comic book fans and people that want to shove popcorn in their mouths. This film rewards you for really noticing the details while still having massive explosions. One of my favorites is how Lex has all of Batman's branded killed which is why he isn't afraid of the branding at the end or Grandma's Peach Tea as a way of scaring the s*** out of someone. Of course, this film isn't perfect and I do have personal dislikes. The Batman V Superman fight was slow and pretty boring especially after watching such an amazing fight in Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 2 (If you haven't watched the animated Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 1 and 2 you are sorely missing out on something fantastic). Also, the addition of Wonder Woman who pretty much steals a hacker thing, gives it back and then suits up and fights against a giant monster thing. Not to say I don't like Wonder Woman (She is one of my favorite Superheroes of all time who showed not only can woman kick a** but they also don't need to be ashamed of their sexuality or gender) but she wasn't really that helpful to the plot and just brought in to expand the universe which was well done through Lex's superhuman hunting files. Also, the post-apocalyptic scene that was just a dream could have been cut but nothing is perfect except movies like Citizen Kane which isn't a lot of fun to watch cause it is too perfect. So to summarize, the theatrical cut is bad, the ultimate cut is Amazing and the other cut is meh. Please give it a second chance because it deserves it and save a good director from losing grace because of something he didn't do."
"I really liked it, don't know what all the hate is about. I'm actually a Marvel fan from when I was 7 or so, but Superman and Batman together in 1 movie? Just great. And personally I like Ben Affleck even better than Christian Bale as Batman. So just watch and enjoy, I know I did!"

"That's right. We have been waiting for these two heroes to finally meet and fight against each other. This movie is so good in both plot and special effects.Henry Cavill and Ben Affleck have performed well in their acting stages. They are the best superhero actors and they have filmed their fighting scenes very well. The movie starts to show the conflict between the lives of the heroes and now they have blamed each other for it. This movie is amazing and sets up a good plot for Dawn Justice."

"Actually...I didn't know what to expect. When you see Wonder Woman, you know it will be off of Wonder Woman and off of a Wonder Woman story, but with Batman V Superman, I was like, \"hmmmm, so who is this about?\" It was pretty obvious that it would feature many characters, but I thought the introduction to Batman was amazing. Ben Affleck nailed the part, not only as Batman but also as Bruce Wayne. He is my Batman. Henry Cavill continued to be super as the Man of Steel. And he is my Super - Man. A dark story? Yes, without a doubt. Could it have had a few more jokes? Sure. But not all movies or stories need to have jokes when certain events are serious. I really hope people can see this review and take another look at the movie, because, I loved it. I really hope the ratings can go up, eventually. And P.S, this movie is the perfect set up to Justice League."

"I'll start by making it clear I have only ever seen the Ultimate Edition. I'm aware of what was cut out for the theatrical release, so I will concede up front that most of the criticisms about pacing, editing, and missing bits of plot at release were merited.With that caveat out of the way, I must reiterate that this was bar-none the boldest superhero movie I have ever seen. To me, it was arguably the best as well, though \"best\" shouldn't be taken to mean \"most enjoyable.\" That honor easily goes to \"Thor: Ragnarok.\" What makes BvS stand out among other films in the genre is that it takes two characters who have been done to death since the 1970s and brings them up to date. I recently tried to watch \"Superman: The Movie\" for the first time in a number of years, and while it was still good and Reeves will always be iconic, I just couldn't take it seriously. I'll put it this way: If the story in BvS was \"stupid\" in your view but Superman turning back time by spinning the earth backward on its axis didn't seem like one of the dumbest things you have ever seen -in any movie from any genre- to the extent that it outright ruins the movie for you, then your opinion about BvS isn't worth much. Nostalgic bias was always going to be a problem for this movie, and the way people reacted to and reviewed \"Man of Steel\" was telling in this regard.That brings me to Zack Snyder's take on Superman. You know, that guy whose status as the first extraterrestrial ever encountered by humanity was a total non-issue in the old movies. Apparently, Snyder has a similar view to my own in that his take on the Man of Steel makes his being an alien a core piece of his identity. He may look like any other (absurdly attractive) person, but he knows what he is, and that makes him perpetually uncertain of where he fits in this world. He is essentially good and really does care about people, but he struggles to truly empathize with the likes of us. To be human is to be frail, and that is not something he can easily relate to. This is the root of his conflict with Batman.Just as Clark struggles to genuinely relate to most people, Snyder's Batman either refuses to or otherwise just can't relate to Superman. He doesn't see him as anything but a threat regardless of Superman's clear good intentions. Remember, a small group of Kryptonians were able to bring humanity to the brink of extinction in less than a day, and Bruce Wayne is nothing if not a realist. He didn't know the guy from Kansas. He only knew the god from another world.While Batman's anger toward and fear of Superman are readily apparent from the start, Superman's inability to imagine things from Bruce Wayne's perspective only becomes truly apparent during their first real interaction. This reminded me of the animated version of the \"world's finest\" storyline, where Superman judges Batman harshly for using fear tactics and threats of violence (also, actual violence) to get the job done. Superman wasn't willing to consider what it would take for a human man to fight criminals and save innocents, or what that life would do to him over time. Just as Batman didn't see the guy from Kansas, Superman didn't see the man who lives his life trapped in one brutal, unthinkably traumatic moment (this was beautifully conveyed during the film's opening moments), and had spent his whole adult life bearing witness to humanity at its absolute worst.The conflict between these two characters is as old as human history. They want the same things, but they can't understand one another. So they fight. And what a fight it was.Watching a fight between, say, Captain America and Iron Man was, to me, more frustrating than anything because each understood the other's perspective perfectly. The fight between Batman and Superman in BvS was genuinely gut-wrenching, as intended, because they would have understood one another if either had tried. The whole sequence hilighted Batman's tactical prowess and ability to control a situation. Maybe the most badass thing about the fight was that it ended exactly where Batman planned. That brings me to the big elephant in the room named \"Martha.\"I can't recall exactly which YouTuber put it this way, but if you thought the \"save Martha\" exchange was about their mothers having the same name, you had your brain turned off. The brain-on people have explained this to death, but it bears repeating. This was the moment when Superman became humanized to Batman. He was about to die, and his only concern was for his adoptive human mother. He still believed that the man about to take his life would do the right thing. Even with the cowl on, there was no mistaking the look on Batman's face. It was the look of shame, guilt, and sudden uncertainty that says \"What am I doing?\" Turns out even the most brutal, angry version of Bruce Wayne is better than Tony Stark at knowing right from wrong. At knowing that he had gone too far.From there, the third act was a series of truly impressive (albeit mostly CGI) fight sequences, beginning with what I regard as the undisputed champion of Batman fights. Nothing in the Nolan movies (and especially nothing in the Burton movies) even came close. Go ahead, try to convince yourself that Batman and Bane taking turns punching one another in the face until Bane's mask broke was a good fight sequence. No, this was a fight straight out of \"Arkham Knight,\" and it was glorious. The battle against Doomsday really was one for the books. From the moment Wonder Woman arrived accompanied by the intense sounds of Tina Guo's electric cello to Superman's tragic, heroic death at the hands of Doomsday, I was glued to the screen. Sure, the mere presence of Doomsday spoiled the end to a degree, but watching the Man of Steel laboring to carry that kryptonite spear towards certain death was no less impactful. A brief word on Jesse Eisenberg's take on Lex Luthor. At least one other reviewer on this site already said it best when they pointed out that this was his origin story. If you consider his scheme objectively, he is actually one of the more formidable incarnations of the character. If we're lucky, we'll eventually get to see a Snyder Cut of \"Justice League\" and find out where this story was actually meant to go. For the record, Joss Whedon and Danny Elfman both should have said \"no\" to taking a dump on someone else's art."
"BATMAN V SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE brings a fantastic surprise to a smash-hit team-up with one of the worlds most beloved DC Comics' icons of all time. The movie delivers spectacular casting, and fantastic acting with different characters having their shine in each scenes.The story follows Clark Kent/Superman who becomes a threat, after the destruction in Metropolis in Man Of Steel.(2013). Batman/Bruce Wayne sees him as a threat and begins his war on Superman.The movie brings spectacular storytelling, it tells the complications of human against alien who are on the same side, and the first meeting of Batman and Superman. The story of Bruce Wayne, with his many years of The Caped Crusader, sends him on a spiral of \"out of control\", sheer anger, and builds tension to wanting to defeat the Man of Steel. Snyder has fantastically gave this storytelling an exciting nod to the comics.Lex Luthor, played by Jesse Einsberg, delivers a very interesting performance, but very differently by him showing is his \"origin\" before he becomes a bald foe to the Man of Steel. He shows that his love of \"god vs man\" terrorises mankind when he ultimately creates Doomsday, and Batman realises Superman's inner heroism.It packs so many great \"out of nowhere\" excitement, including a first-look of the fearful Wonder Woman a.k.a. Diana Prince, played by Gal Gadot, and a fresh-new glimpse of the superhero DC canon: The Justice League.WATCH THIS MOVIE! The critics are out of their mind. It's a fun-packed action adventure which still keeps the movie enjoyable until it's final minutes of the movie. It's a FANTASTIC MOVIE! BEN AFFLECK AS BATMAN... is Incredible!A 10/10 overall!"
"I want to go on record as saying that this is a truly thrilling cinematic experience in so many ways. If pressed, I guess I could acknowledge that there were a couple ... let's say \"clumsy\" moments. And in a film that runs to three hours, that hardly seems like a significant issue, certainly not enough to rate it with fewer than 9 stars.This film has everything. There is dramatic tension right from the start. There is a magnificent story arc that picks up quite seamlessly from 'Man of Steel' and propels the viewer not only into the life of Clark Kent/Superman but also of Bruce Wayne/Batman.The villain is no mere cartoon of a villain; he is truly thoroughly (and apparently irrevocably) diabolical. He is a psychopath, and you wish for his death over and over and over. You want Superman to reduce him to ash with the power of his eyes.I have read a number of viewers' reviews, and it seems that the people who disliked the film / gave it a low rating had rather unfair and unrealistic expectations of it. That is, their own prejudices about how the plot could/should unfold or what the character development could/should be, etc. ruined the film for them. And that is a shame.My thought is: I settle into my seat, wait for the lights to dim, and then I wait to be transported by the film. I accept it, lock, stock, and barrel.As another reviewer remarked, I love how the film begins from the point of view of Bruce Wayne as he is among people on the ground who have fallen victim to the attack of Zod and the other Kryptonians.Why would Bruce Wayne not like Superman? Why would the good people of Earth hurl insults at Superman and burn him in effigy (on the news)? Because the good people of Earth just got catapulted into a new reality in which there are not only extraterrestrial beings (surprise!) but they are also superman! And a group of them are hell-bent on destroying humankind and taking the planet for themselves.It is difficult to see Superman as separate from the whole Kryptonian Krew.It seems that many moviegoers forgot that Bruce Wayne is also human. Sure, he's a hero, but he is flawed.. Just like the rest of us. He is a vigilante, after all.He has let his vigilantism get the better of him. HE is actually the one working outside the boundaries of the law, not Superman. It is the clear head of Alfred that shows us that he has gone into a rather dark place, that he has not seen what is really going on (in Luthor's scheme), and so he chooses to embark on his own scheme scheme to take out the alien invader. He is (allegedly) thinking of the future: if he wipes out the all-powerful alien, then it can't turn on humankind in the future. At least, he convinces himself of that.A philosophical question is raised in the film: should Clark Kent have remained a simple man from Kansas and never have become the Superman? Should he just let people die and let calamities happen? The question is answered for us in the character of Diana Prince/Wonder Woman. She withdrew from mankind (her exact words) and just sat around watching. Watching while people died horrible deaths all around her. So, should Superman have done the same? Do these special beings, these 'metahumans', have some kind of moral imperative to intervene, or should they be allowed to be regular people, too? It seems that humans want it both ways.It seems that humans are saying: \"Don't be a superalien ... except when I and my friends and family are in trouble. Then come save us.\""

"Batman v Superman: Ultimate Edition: If your looking for a quick, cheap thrill then you might not enjoy this film at the time. This movies theatrical version was butchered by WB and in doing so reshaped the story leaving numerous plot holes. So the Ultimate Edition is the full story and the one worth seeing. Watch 'Man of Steel' before seeing this movie. There is much to claw through here, so much so that the audience might easily find themselves exhausted from the overall aggression of the film. However, a lot of the story does work. The action is good, and the emotion feels real most of the time.This film is about Superman trying to become Superman. Trying to help the world, save people, find a place in this world not as an outcast, and yet is looked at has a threat by many. Superman is not from this world, yet He is trying to be human, find a place in this world, be excepted by earths people, and come into his destiny.This film is also about Batman being Batman for 20 years and losing faith in humanity, and fearing Superman, what Superman can do with his powers. Great film, great plot, great visuals. ---Yidioo"
"I didn't see the film in the theaters and just bought the \"Extended Edition \" on Amazon. I never properly saw Man of Steel- i think I rented it and watched it when already exhausted and fell asleep. I saw the mediocre user reviews and horrible reviews from critics of this film.They really have it wrong. This is the very best either Batman or Superman. It has a different take, on things. Much darker then earlier films even darker then the Christopher Nolan Batman films.First of all Christopher Nolan is an Executive Producer. So how bad could it be? I loved Sucker Punch and Zack Snyder was involved with that. So how bad could this be? Hans Zimmer did the music, so how bad could it be?I remember watching the old Superman TV shows and reading the Superman and Batman comics as a little kid and loved them, but i wouldn't call myself a \"fan boy\" of comic universes, like so many younger people today. As an older adult I will admit my favorite TV show of all time was Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but watched it on DVD only after it had finished. I saw the second of the Dark Knight series in the theater, but the other two, I watched on DVD. They were great, but not my favorite films like so many people. i also loved the first couple Superman and Batman films in the older series. Regardless, i was not waiting with baited breath to see Man of Steel or this one.I'm more of a serious film fan, who can watch Stanley Kubrick films over and over and my favorite films in the last twenty years, are Eyes Wide Shut and Intersteller, both of which i've watched multiple times.So, with that said, take it from me, the critics have this film very wrong, just as critics hated 2001: A Space Odyssey when it first came out. This film will have lasting appreciation.Surprised how much I liked Ben Afleck's Batman. it was hard to get into Henry Cavil's scrawnier looking Superman, but it grew on me. Amy Adams was great as Lois Lane, The Gal Gadol Wonder Women was amazing. Lex Luther was terrific, like Nolan's Joker. Jeremy Irons was the best Alfred ever. Holly Hunter and Diane Lane was good too. The movie had bad reviews but made a billion dollars. Hopefully everyone buys the Ultimate Edition and it breaks sales records and the film is re-appreciated. I have no idea what scenes this Ultimate Edition added, but it is pretty perfect. Now I can't wait for Wonder Woman and the Justice League and as soon as I finish writing this am going to watch Man of Steal. I'm into it now!I can only surmise that the bad reviews stem from too much expectations of the rigid fan boy types and the radical changes in tone, we see in this film.Total masterpiece of cinema, but I have a few criticisms. There are a few hollow scenes of typical Idiot cops and authorities getting everything wrong in a cliché type way and it has a few filler scenes of that type and a few moments here and there that felt rushed and cheesy. Maybe not everything restored into the Ultimate Edition should have been. I wish there had been more Kevin Costner scenes."

"The whole entire Batman V Superman movie was great and yes even though it felt slow to the majority of the people who watched it but to me I enjoyed every part and every scene of Batman V Superman and when it got to the fight scenes both batman VS Superman and the Doomsday fight it brought so much drama, intensity, and epic performances. So with that being said I give this movie a good 10/10 because it really did go to my expectations and it brought a powerful performance and a powerful yet epic introduction to the upcoming Justice League."

"Zack Snyder not only understands the characters but he also understands how to craft a real amazing movie for fans - honestly blew me away (extended cut) Brilliant!Don't believe what the internet is telling you to think - take this from a person who has worked in the comic book industry - this is amazing!"

"When I first wrote a review for this movie a year ago exclaiming my excitement for the film, I had been high off a fresh dose of live-action DC superheroes playing out the beloved comic book stories that I had grown up on. It was all playing out before my eyes and coming to life. After a few months had passed, I began to notice things about the movie that I disliked: little gaps in the story, things that didn't add up, etc. My original rating of a 10 / 10 dropped to an 8 /10. But today it has gone back up to a 10. The extended version of the film not only rectifies the gaps but also silences critics.Many claimed that the movie was too dark or that it just didn't make sense. To those people, I say: \"Pick up a comic book!\" Many of the critics of this particular film were part of the superhero bandwagon that formed when Marvel began its spree of Avengers-related films. In fact, its estimated that over 60% of people who go to see 'superhero' genre films have never picked up a comic book in their life. I would argue that similar numbers could figure to those which view the CW televised DC Universe shows. People complain that DC comics is just too dark but the fact is that these movies are based upon actual comics which are meant to be dark (ex: The Dark Knight Returns, Injustice, etc.). Its like complaining that Game of Thrones (the TV series) sucks because they kill off too many characters. Read the books! Its frustrating to see such a beautiful work of art like Batman V Superman criticized by those ignorant to its universe and its meaning. This movie is in fact a catalyst that opens numerous doorways and leaves true fans in awe of the possibilities for future movies. But regardless of whether or not people choose to educate themselves, this film's DVD/Blu-ray extended version puts the theater release to shame. All of the plot holes and gaps are filled in 30 minutes of extended footage scattered throughout the film. The movie ultimately becomes more complete and people will wish that the movie had shown the full 3 hours of footage in its theatrical debut. As a major DC comics fan, I will of course pick up on things that a comics fan would not, but someone who does not read comics would learn to appreciate this film in its entirety with the extended version. Get your hands on a copy today or find it on Netflix or the internet somewhere!"

"I ignored the bad reviews and watched anyways. This film had a lot to live up to after Civil War was released and I went into this film expecting the worst. It ended up to be the best Superhero film of 2016 to me. One complaint was that this film was more concerned about universe building than telling a great story than Civil War but for me it was the other way around; Civil War felt like a build up to something else and to be honest, I felt that way when I saw the other MCU films. Batman vs Superman however not only had a great story, but it also felt a lot more consistent than Civil War. This film was way more diverse with the cast than the MCU but unlike the MCU, I felt like this film doesn't go overboard with the SJW stuff like the MCU films or The Star Wars Sequel films do. The Visuals were AMAZING, The Score by Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL was AMAZING as well, The Tone is just right as I actually felt for the characters emotionally, The Cinematography kept my eyes glued to the screen, and the script felt really Intelligent and Complex and despite people calling the writing confusing, I was able to piece it together with no problem whatsoever. This film is similar to Empire Strikes back in terms of popularity so over time after the other movies are released, this movie would probably be more popular.This film was way better than I Expected and deserves another chance.

"Its shame to see what critics and marvel fans did to this movie and targeted Zack Snyder for it. I have seen this movie more than 25 times till date. And i enjoy this movie as much as i enjoyed the first time. The fans who have read DC comics, wouldn't be disappointed in this movie. Its dark movie, yes it is. Because the title shows the intense situation at hand. Two superheroes about to rip each other apart for whatever reasons that brought them to this stage. Yes it had to be dark and intense.Only marvel can be stupid enough to show an alien invasion where humans are loosing the battle and the super heroes are cracking jokes while battles as if they are playing ping pong. a person playing Call of Duty game is more serious while playing than the marvel heroes fighting aliens."

"Last week some news came out from somebody online who had claimed to have seen a finished version of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. If you were like me, you've been leery of checking it out because you weren't sure how much might actually be true. Now Zack Snyder has spoken out about the spoiler-filled post, although his response doesn't really clear anything up.In a word, to MTV, he called the post \"hilarious,which might imply that he's saying that it's mostly, if not entirely, untrue. That might be the case, but then again he could have just said it was untrue and he didn't say that. What he did say, however, is that he doesn't like spoilers. While this may seem odd for the director who's most recent trailer appeared to give away the entire movie, Snyder says that's not the case. Even if you've seen the trailer, you can rest easy, as there is much more we have not seen in then finished film. Says Snyder I have the benefit of seeing the movie. It's cool that think it's too much, and I appreciate people not wanting to know, but there's plenty that they don't know. There's a lot of movie that's not in the trailer. In the process of calling the Batman v Superman Reddit review hilarious, Snyder goes on to talk about how he hates it when spoilers come out. The director would much rather that fans see the movie mostly blind. While he understands that some fans may wish to find the answers before hand, he wants his movies to be mysteries going in. If you're, as an audience member, exploring these articles, looking for answers to questions that you have, maybe you're okay with knowing before you go. It's like an individual taste. But like I said, I want people to see the movie without knowing.Spoilers are a topic that mean different things to different people. While most try to avoid them to some degree, the need to solve the mystery is a nearly universal human experience. We have an inclination to want to know the truth, even while also wanting to be surprised. For most of us getting some information is good, but getting all the information is bad, of course, only getting the details that you want can be difficult."
"The theatrical is choppy, poorly edited, hard to follow, with some really good moments mixed in their. The extended is much more fluent and is much easier to follow, it does have a long runtime, which might make it seem a bit dragging on, but if you like long films done right, like Lord of the Rings, you will like this movie as long as you get into the characters and story. Speaking of which, the story starts out perfectly showing Bruce Wayne as a character, and it is very powerful. There are several moments in this movie that are powerful, emotional, and shocking. Characters. Batman is my favorite fictional character of all time, and believe me when I say, Ben Affleck as Batman was perfect, he had the charisma, the anger, and the look of being through some bad stuff Gal Gadot also does perfect as Wonder Woman, but if you want to really see how good she does, go watch the Wonder Woman movie. Henry Call as Superman. I really don't like it when people say Christopher Reeves is better. Don't get me wrong, Reeves does great, but can you imagine him as Superman in this movie? I wouldn't like it. It would be like Adam West playing Batman in The Dark Knight. Henry Cavill does great in this role, I can say everything about him as I said with Ben Affleck. Jesse Eisenberg as Luthor. I thought it was different in a good way. I've heard a criticism for him as being too much like Joker, but is that a bad thing? Joker is my favorite villain, so to see Superman have an enemy that crazy, but still hold the values Luthor needs to be Luthor, I think it is great. The thing I thought this movie was lacking in the first and second acts was humor, at least good humor. If there was more humor, I would've given this movie a ten because it would give a more relaxing feel to the parts that needed it. All in all though, this movie was awesome, it had powerful moments, it was badass, and just plain fun. It had a great story arc and does its job very well."

"*I will be talking about the Ultimate Edition of the film* This was one of the most anticipated CBM of all time. Ever since the arrival and subsequent success of Marvel's The Avengers people have wondered when will DC launch its own cinematic universe, one of the main reasons being the opportunity to finally see titans such as Batman and Superman share the screen together: the ultimate nerd dream. On 2016, the moment finally came for BvS to be released AND.. it performed poorly. Not only did critical reception left a lot to be desired, but fan reactions where surprisingly split after its cinematic debut. People either loved it and called Zack a genius, or hated it and called him a hack. Me, personally, I found myself with middle of the road feelings, for sure, but more leaning towards the negative side with subsequent viewings. The theatrical cut of the film showcased amazing performances, incredible visuals, and action set pieces that seemed like comic book panels come to life, in a good way. However, when it comes to its narrative structure and more technical aspects like editing, the film was seriously flawed. More plot holes than Age of Ultron, questionable character decisions, random editing that lacked cohesion and focus, and forced dramatic moments that lacked any impact because the attempts at character development ranged from limited to nonexistent, especially when it comes to Superman's character. I thought it was a 5/10 movie at best. As such, I was kind of skeptical about the idea of a 30 minute longer version. I say kind of because I know how Zack works. I remember Watchmen being vastly improved with its director's cut, so in a way I was expecting BvS to perform in a similar manner, but I also feared those 30 minutes wold be just there to amplify action and discredit storytelling issues. Oh boy, I'm so glad I was proved wrong. The ultimate cut of the film was infuriating, but not because it was awful, but because it questions the sanity of WB executives and editors and makes you wonder what were they thinking during the editing process. What I got out of the Ultimate Edition was a thought-provoking deconstruction of two very iconic superheroes that gave spotlight to the struggles both of them face when they aren't fighting crime. What I got was an extremely well produced character study on both Batman and Superman in a cynical world, a world dangerously close to our own. We meet Batman as a ruthless, worn out hero that has seen the failure behind his ideals and witnessed some truly horrifying things in his life. Superman, on the other hand, is portrayed as a godlike figure that seeks to do good in the world, but finds himself emotionally conflicted once he realized that every good deed he does leaves behind a trail of destruction (most of it due to Luthor's antics). In my opinion, this is a hugely original approach, one that distances itself from the rest of the competition and delivers a dark, somber, yet relevant superhero movie that understands both characters and gives them real human struggles to deal with. I felt invested in both of them, and hoped that by the end of the film both could find a way to redeem themselves. Their character arcs were very well established during the first two acts of the movie, and by the time we get to the titular climactic battle the emotion behind the jaw-dropping action is intensified. Lex Luthor as a villain was also given more time to develop with this new edition. One of the main criticisms with the original version was the fact that his plan relied too much on conveniences, and the character's mannerisms and mad-scientist attitude was annoying, and that goes without saying his motivations were unclear. Not only do we spend more time understanding his hate for any godlike figure and thus his hatred for Superman, but the added scenes allowed us to witness his entire plan come to fruition. It sells the cold, manipulative, calculating attributes of his comic counterpart. The acting is spot on. Every actor owns his/her role, from Cavill's Superman, to Ben Affleck as Batman, Eisenberg as Luthor, and Gadot as Wonder Woman, whose scenes are brief, but are more than enough to sell the strong and ferocious warrior that she is. Cinematography is stunning, and miles above that of Man of Steel's. And the soundtrack by Zimmer and Junkie XL? Perfect, just perfect. When it comes to flaws, the film still has some of those. The Martha moment, while serving as a pivotal character moment for Batman, felt off in execution, and its understandable that many people got mad at it. If your main complaint about BvS the first time around was its bleak tone and subject matter, this film is still not for you. I understand most were expecting to see the heroes being the most iconic versions of themselves, clashing in an elongated battle and evoking the same feelings The Avengers gave audiences back in 2012. In that sense, the film will remain divisive, but at least I have the comfort of saying that, at the very least, the film is competently made."

"This film was amazing. Ben Affleck was easily the best part of this movie, he brought his a-game as Batman. The chemistry between Affleck & Irons was outstanding. Gal Gadot did a great job as Wonder Woman. The fight between Batman & Superman was awesome. The final fight with Doomsday was outstanding in every way possible. However, there is only one problem with this film and that's Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor. He was sadly missed cast in this role, but then again it's really the fault of Warner Bros. Studios. Overall, this film deliver on almost every level. I highly recommend that you watch the extended version of this film."

"I know I know. I saw it in theaters too, and felt like it could've been so much better. While the Batman element was good, the narrative felt fractured, and the third act was just one long stunt scene. Superman was relegated to a supporting character, and other characters didn't get a chance to shine. And then I chanced on the ultimate cut. Calling it 30 mins of \"extra\" footage is unfair to Zack Snyder because it's exactly these 30 mins that makes the movie a worthy one. What I can say about the theatrical cut is this - It had the blockbuster elements - music, visuals, stunts, CGI. But, it lacked the human elements. The first 20 mins of the movie had it, but not after that. The extended cut in comparison has a flow to the narrative. There are no disjointed scenes, everything flows smoothly, and there's connective tissue. Superman gets to spend some time with his father, and mother. Clark Kent does some investigative journalism. Superman helps the people after the blast. Lois Lane doesn't jump to conclusions, she gets to the bottom of the crime. Lex Luthor apparently had a coherent plan - everything is explained pretty well. Wonder Woman was already good, so there's no change there :) Also, the \"Martha\" scene seems better executed, because it is a few seconds longer, and there's time to breathe it in. So, here's my take on this movie - The theatrical cut was junk. Get the Bluray for ultimate edition, and you shall not be disappointed. I've seen it so many more times now, and it's the definitive cut. It is the movie we deserve. It's a unique take on Batman, and Superman. It's a gritty take on the superhero movie genre, and definitely the best DCEU movie, and the best DC movie since The Dark Knight.P.S. Yes it's dark. We're adults, and we should appreciate mature film making without intentionally silly moments. It attempts to be philosophical, and something deep instead of just trying to make you chuckle."

"This is one of the best superhero movies ever made. Zack Snyder is a magician behind the camera.The reason behind so many complaints is the fact that Warner Bros. marketed this movie as a fight between Batman and Superman. That's not what it is. It's a movie about the origins of the Justice League.The cinematography, the acting and the score are all second to none. This film is phenomenal.P.S: watch the 3 hour extended cut that Snyder intended you to see, not the 2 and a half hour movie that Warner Bros. decided would be better for theaters."

"I don't care what the critics say, this is a very well-done movie. I'll start my review by listing what I like about the movie.1.) Ben Affleck is the best batman to me and it is not close. He pulls off the role of an aging batman extremely well. Also, Zack Snyder's vision of batman is legit. I have always hated batman up until this adaptation of him. Instead of being a conflicted and idealistic batman, this batman is dark, gritty, and 100% a badass. His equipment is decked out with machine guns and he has no aversion to killing people. In fact, he probably kills about 50 criminal by the time this movie is over. The warehouse scene is the coolest batman scene in any movie.2.) The development of a grudge between batman and superman is pulled off flawlessly. It actually makes sense why batman dislikes superman. Then, when they do fight it is about the coolest thing you can expect to see from a superhero film. 3.) I disagree with a lot of people about Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor. In my opinion, he played his role to perfection. 4.) B v S sets up Wonder Woman and Justice League with Gal Gadot's cameo as Wonder Woman and short clips of Aquaman, the Flash, and Cyborg. B v S is one of my favorite superhero films and rewatching it never gets old."

"The theatrical cut of this film is garbage which is why I rated it eight stars instead of nine. The first time I watched this film I didn't like it (not straight out hate but didn't like). Character motivations didn't make any sense, Lex was annoying as s***, editing was sloppy, and it was overly dark and broody for an action superhero movie. A year + a half, five Marvel films, a ton of bad reviews and a Justice League later a thought popped into my head: \"what if I watched BVS again\". This time I didn't have trailers ruining the best moments, I only vaguely remembered the film, and I was conditioned to look at it negatively but something unexpected happened: I actually loved it. Superman was just a normal person that tried to make a difference cause he could that others imposed their own beliefs on. Lex Luthor was a genius that couldn't stand his powerlessness compared to Superman or more accurately a super being. As Alfred said \"The fever, the rage, the feeling of powerlessness that turns good men... cruel\" and you see the same thought process in Batman. Batman, just like Lex Luthor feels powerless in the midst of a god-being and just like Lex he attempts to destroy him so he can get his sense of power back but unlike Lex, Batman learns something. I what is one of the corniest lines of the movie Superman says, \"Martha\" when he knows he can't win against Batman in a late desperate attempt to save his mother. Not only does this name connect with Bruce Wayne but it also shows what really matters to a man of steel: it isn't power, it isn't fame or anything else, it is his Mother and on a broader scale it is people. Lex (who doesn't care about people at all) knows he doesn't have the power so he creates something from his blood and the remains of Zod: A Doomsday for Superman. Not only does this film have depth but it also doesn't always explain it to you which is rare in a blockbuster action superhero flick normally cater to semi-comic book fans and people that want to shove popcorn in their mouths. This film rewards you for really noticing the details while still having massive explosions. One of my favorites is how Lex has all of Batman's branded killed which is why he isn't afraid of the branding at the end or Grandma's Peach Tea as a way of scaring the s*** out of someone. Of course, this film isn't perfect and I do have personal dislikes. The Batman V Superman fight was slow and pretty boring especially after watching such an amazing fight in Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 2 (If you haven't watched the animated Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 1 and 2 you are sorely missing out on something fantastic). Also, the addition of Wonder Woman who pretty much steals a hacker thing, gives it back and then suits up and fights against a giant monster thing. Not to say I don't like Wonder Woman (She is one of my favorite Superheroes of all time who showed not only can woman kick a** but they also don't need to be ashamed of their sexuality or gender) but she wasn't really that helpful to the plot and just brought in to expand the universe which was well done through Lex's superhuman hunting files. Also, the post-apocalyptic scene that was just a dream could have been cut but nothing is perfect except movies like Citizen Kane which isn't a lot of fun to watch cause it is too perfect. So to summarize, the theatrical cut is bad, the ultimate cut is Amazing and the other cut is meh. Please give it a second chance because it deserves it and save a good director from losing grace because of something he didn't do."
"I really liked it, don't know what all the hate is about. I'm actually a Marvel fan from when I was 7 or so, but Superman and Batman together in 1 movie? Just great. And personally I like Ben Affleck even better than Christian Bale as Batman. So just watch and enjoy, I know I did!"

"That's right. We have been waiting for these two heroes to finally meet and fight against each other. This movie is so good in both plot and special effects.Henry Cavill and Ben Affleck have performed well in their acting stages. They are the best superhero actors and they have filmed their fighting scenes very well. The movie starts to show the conflict between the lives of the heroes and now they have blamed each other for it. This movie is amazing and sets up a good plot for Dawn Justice."

"Actually...I didn't know what to expect. When you see Wonder Woman, you know it will be off of Wonder Woman and off of a Wonder Woman story, but with Batman V Superman, I was like, \"hmmmm, so who is this about?\" It was pretty obvious that it would feature many characters, but I thought the introduction to Batman was amazing. Ben Affleck nailed the part, not only as Batman but also as Bruce Wayne. He is my Batman. Henry Cavill continued to be super as the Man of Steel. And he is my Super - Man. A dark story? Yes, without a doubt. Could it have had a few more jokes? Sure. But not all movies or stories need to have jokes when certain events are serious. I really hope people can see this review and take another look at the movie, because, I loved it. I really hope the ratings can go up, eventually. And P.S, this movie is the perfect set up to Justice League."

"I'll start by making it clear I have only ever seen the Ultimate Edition. I'm aware of what was cut out for the theatrical release, so I will concede up front that most of the criticisms about pacing, editing, and missing bits of plot at release were merited.With that caveat out of the way, I must reiterate that this was bar-none the boldest superhero movie I have ever seen. To me, it was arguably the best as well, though \"best\" shouldn't be taken to mean \"most enjoyable.\" That honor easily goes to \"Thor: Ragnarok.\" What makes BvS stand out among other films in the genre is that it takes two characters who have been done to death since the 1970s and brings them up to date. I recently tried to watch \"Superman: The Movie\" for the first time in a number of years, and while it was still good and Reeves will always be iconic, I just couldn't take it seriously. I'll put it this way: If the story in BvS was \"stupid\" in your view but Superman turning back time by spinning the earth backward on its axis didn't seem like one of the dumbest things you have ever seen -in any movie from any genre- to the extent that it outright ruins the movie for you, then your opinion about BvS isn't worth much. Nostalgic bias was always going to be a problem for this movie, and the way people reacted to and reviewed \"Man of Steel\" was telling in this regard.That brings me to Zack Snyder's take on Superman. You know, that guy whose status as the first extraterrestrial ever encountered by humanity was a total non-issue in the old movies. Apparently, Snyder has a similar view to my own in that his take on the Man of Steel makes his being an alien a core piece of his identity. He may look like any other (absurdly attractive) person, but he knows what he is, and that makes him perpetually uncertain of where he fits in this world. He is essentially good and really does care about people, but he struggles to truly empathize with the likes of us. To be human is to be frail, and that is not something he can easily relate to. This is the root of his conflict with Batman.Just as Clark struggles to genuinely relate to most people, Snyder's Batman either refuses to or otherwise just can't relate to Superman. He doesn't see him as anything but a threat regardless of Superman's clear good intentions. Remember, a small group of Kryptonians were able to bring humanity to the brink of extinction in less than a day, and Bruce Wayne is nothing if not a realist. He didn't know the guy from Kansas. He only knew the god from another world.While Batman's anger toward and fear of Superman are readily apparent from the start, Superman's inability to imagine things from Bruce Wayne's perspective only becomes truly apparent during their first real interaction. This reminded me of the animated version of the \"world's finest\" storyline, where Superman judges Batman harshly for using fear tactics and threats of violence (also, actual violence) to get the job done. Superman wasn't willing to consider what it would take for a human man to fight criminals and save innocents, or what that life would do to him over time. Just as Batman didn't see the guy from Kansas, Superman didn't see the man who lives his life trapped in one brutal, unthinkably traumatic moment (this was beautifully conveyed during the film's opening moments), and had spent his whole adult life bearing witness to humanity at its absolute worst.The conflict between these two characters is as old as human history. They want the same things, but they can't understand one another. So they fight. And what a fight it was.Watching a fight between, say, Captain America and Iron Man was, to me, more frustrating than anything because each understood the other's perspective perfectly. The fight between Batman and Superman in BvS was genuinely gut-wrenching, as intended, because they would have understood one another if either had tried. The whole sequence hilighted Batman's tactical prowess and ability to control a situation. Maybe the most badass thing about the fight was that it ended exactly where Batman planned. That brings me to the big elephant in the room named \"Martha.\"I can't recall exactly which YouTuber put it this way, but if you thought the \"save Martha\" exchange was about their mothers having the same name, you had your brain turned off. The brain-on people have explained this to death, but it bears repeating. This was the moment when Superman became humanized to Batman. He was about to die, and his only concern was for his adoptive human mother. He still believed that the man about to take his life would do the right thing. Even with the cowl on, there was no mistaking the look on Batman's face. It was the look of shame, guilt, and sudden uncertainty that says \"What am I doing?\" Turns out even the most brutal, angry version of Bruce Wayne is better than Tony Stark at knowing right from wrong. At knowing that he had gone too far.From there, the third act was a series of truly impressive (albeit mostly CGI) fight sequences, beginning with what I regard as the undisputed champion of Batman fights. Nothing in the Nolan movies (and especially nothing in the Burton movies) even came close. Go ahead, try to convince yourself that Batman and Bane taking turns punching one another in the face until Bane's mask broke was a good fight sequence. No, this was a fight straight out of \"Arkham Knight,\" and it was glorious. The battle against Doomsday really was one for the books. From the moment Wonder Woman arrived accompanied by the intense sounds of Tina Guo's electric cello to Superman's tragic, heroic death at the hands of Doomsday, I was glued to the screen. Sure, the mere presence of Doomsday spoiled the end to a degree, but watching the Man of Steel laboring to carry that kryptonite spear towards certain death was no less impactful. A brief word on Jesse Eisenberg's take on Lex Luthor. At least one other reviewer on this site already said it best when they pointed out that this was his origin story. If you consider his scheme objectively, he is actually one of the more formidable incarnations of the character. If we're lucky, we'll eventually get to see a Snyder Cut of \"Justice League\" and find out where this story was actually meant to go. For the record, Joss Whedon and Danny Elfman both should have said \"no\" to taking a dump on someone else's art."
"BATMAN V SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE brings a fantastic surprise to a smash-hit team-up with one of the worlds most beloved DC Comics' icons of all time. The movie delivers spectacular casting, and fantastic acting with different characters having their shine in each scenes.The story follows Clark Kent/Superman who becomes a threat, after the destruction in Metropolis in Man Of Steel.(2013). Batman/Bruce Wayne sees him as a threat and begins his war on Superman.The movie brings spectacular storytelling, it tells the complications of human against alien who are on the same side, and the first meeting of Batman and Superman. The story of Bruce Wayne, with his many years of The Caped Crusader, sends him on a spiral of \"out of control\", sheer anger, and builds tension to wanting to defeat the Man of Steel. Snyder has fantastically gave this storytelling an exciting nod to the comics.Lex Luthor, played by Jesse Einsberg, delivers a very interesting performance, but very differently by him showing is his \"origin\" before he becomes a bald foe to the Man of Steel. He shows that his love of \"god vs man\" terrorises mankind when he ultimately creates Doomsday, and Batman realises Superman's inner heroism.It packs so many great \"out of nowhere\" excitement, including a first-look of the fearful Wonder Woman a.k.a. Diana Prince, played by Gal Gadot, and a fresh-new glimpse of the superhero DC canon: The Justice League.WATCH THIS MOVIE! The critics are out of their mind. It's a fun-packed action adventure which still keeps the movie enjoyable until it's final minutes of the movie. It's a FANTASTIC MOVIE! BEN AFFLECK AS BATMAN... is Incredible!A 10/10 overall!"
"I want to go on record as saying that this is a truly thrilling cinematic experience in so many ways. If pressed, I guess I could acknowledge that there were a couple ... let's say \"clumsy\" moments. And in a film that runs to three hours, that hardly seems like a significant issue, certainly not enough to rate it with fewer than 9 stars.This film has everything. There is dramatic tension right from the start. There is a magnificent story arc that picks up quite seamlessly from 'Man of Steel' and propels the viewer not only into the life of Clark Kent/Superman but also of Bruce Wayne/Batman.The villain is no mere cartoon of a villain; he is truly thoroughly (and apparently irrevocably) diabolical. He is a psychopath, and you wish for his death over and over and over. You want Superman to reduce him to ash with the power of his eyes.I have read a number of viewers' reviews, and it seems that the people who disliked the film / gave it a low rating had rather unfair and unrealistic expectations of it. That is, their own prejudices about how the plot could/should unfold or what the character development could/should be, etc. ruined the film for them. And that is a shame.My thought is: I settle into my seat, wait for the lights to dim, and then I wait to be transported by the film. I accept it, lock, stock, and barrel.As another reviewer remarked, I love how the film begins from the point of view of Bruce Wayne as he is among people on the ground who have fallen victim to the attack of Zod and the other Kryptonians.Why would Bruce Wayne not like Superman? Why would the good people of Earth hurl insults at Superman and burn him in effigy (on the news)? Because the good people of Earth just got catapulted into a new reality in which there are not only extraterrestrial beings (surprise!) but they are also superman! And a group of them are hell-bent on destroying humankind and taking the planet for themselves.It is difficult to see Superman as separate from the whole Kryptonian Krew.It seems that many moviegoers forgot that Bruce Wayne is also human. Sure, he's a hero, but he is flawed.. Just like the rest of us. He is a vigilante, after all.He has let his vigilantism get the better of him. HE is actually the one working outside the boundaries of the law, not Superman. It is the clear head of Alfred that shows us that he has gone into a rather dark place, that he has not seen what is really going on (in Luthor's scheme), and so he chooses to embark on his own scheme scheme to take out the alien invader. He is (allegedly) thinking of the future: if he wipes out the all-powerful alien, then it can't turn on humankind in the future. At least, he convinces himself of that.A philosophical question is raised in the film: should Clark Kent have remained a simple man from Kansas and never have become the Superman? Should he just let people die and let calamities happen? The question is answered for us in the character of Diana Prince/Wonder Woman. She withdrew from mankind (her exact words) and just sat around watching. Watching while people died horrible deaths all around her. So, should Superman have done the same? Do these special beings, these 'metahumans', have some kind of moral imperative to intervene, or should they be allowed to be regular people, too? It seems that humans want it both ways.It seems that humans are saying: \"Don't be a superalien ... except when I and my friends and family are in trouble. Then come save us.\""

"Batman v Superman: Ultimate Edition: If your looking for a quick, cheap thrill then you might not enjoy this film at the time. This movies theatrical version was butchered by WB and in doing so reshaped the story leaving numerous plot holes. So the Ultimate Edition is the full story and the one worth seeing. Watch 'Man of Steel' before seeing this movie. There is much to claw through here, so much so that the audience might easily find themselves exhausted from the overall aggression of the film. However, a lot of the story does work. The action is good, and the emotion feels real most of the time.This film is about Superman trying to become Superman. Trying to help the world, save people, find a place in this world not as an outcast, and yet is looked at has a threat by many. Superman is not from this world, yet He is trying to be human, find a place in this world, be excepted by earths people, and come into his destiny.This film is also about Batman being Batman for 20 years and losing faith in humanity, and fearing Superman, what Superman can do with his powers. Great film, great plot, great visuals. ---Yidioo"
"I didn't see the film in the theaters and just bought the \"Extended Edition \" on Amazon. I never properly saw Man of Steel- i think I rented it and watched it when already exhausted and fell asleep. I saw the mediocre user reviews and horrible reviews from critics of this film.They really have it wrong. This is the very best either Batman or Superman. It has a different take, on things. Much darker then earlier films even darker then the Christopher Nolan Batman films.First of all Christopher Nolan is an Executive Producer. So how bad could it be? I loved Sucker Punch and Zack Snyder was involved with that. So how bad could this be? Hans Zimmer did the music, so how bad could it be?I remember watching the old Superman TV shows and reading the Superman and Batman comics as a little kid and loved them, but i wouldn't call myself a \"fan boy\" of comic universes, like so many younger people today. As an older adult I will admit my favorite TV show of all time was Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but watched it on DVD only after it had finished. I saw the second of the Dark Knight series in the theater, but the other two, I watched on DVD. They were great, but not my favorite films like so many people. i also loved the first couple Superman and Batman films in the older series. Regardless, i was not waiting with baited breath to see Man of Steel or this one.I'm more of a serious film fan, who can watch Stanley Kubrick films over and over and my favorite films in the last twenty years, are Eyes Wide Shut and Intersteller, both of which i've watched multiple times.So, with that said, take it from me, the critics have this film very wrong, just as critics hated 2001: A Space Odyssey when it first came out. This film will have lasting appreciation.Surprised how much I liked Ben Afleck's Batman. it was hard to get into Henry Cavil's scrawnier looking Superman, but it grew on me. Amy Adams was great as Lois Lane, The Gal Gadol Wonder Women was amazing. Lex Luther was terrific, like Nolan's Joker. Jeremy Irons was the best Alfred ever. Holly Hunter and Diane Lane was good too. The movie had bad reviews but made a billion dollars. Hopefully everyone buys the Ultimate Edition and it breaks sales records and the film is re-appreciated. I have no idea what scenes this Ultimate Edition added, but it is pretty perfect. Now I can't wait for Wonder Woman and the Justice League and as soon as I finish writing this am going to watch Man of Steal. I'm into it now!I can only surmise that the bad reviews stem from too much expectations of the rigid fan boy types and the radical changes in tone, we see in this film.Total masterpiece of cinema, but I have a few criticisms. There are a few hollow scenes of typical Idiot cops and authorities getting everything wrong in a cliché type way and it has a few filler scenes of that type and a few moments here and there that felt rushed and cheesy. Maybe not everything restored into the Ultimate Edition should have been. I wish there had been more Kevin Costner scenes."

"The whole entire Batman V Superman movie was great and yes even though it felt slow to the majority of the people who watched it but to me I enjoyed every part and every scene of Batman V Superman and when it got to the fight scenes both batman VS Superman and the Doomsday fight it brought so much drama, intensity, and epic performances. So with that being said I give this movie a good 10/10 because it really did go to my expectations and it brought a powerful performance and a powerful yet epic introduction to the upcoming Justice League."

"Zack Snyder not only understands the characters but he also understands how to craft a real amazing movie for fans - honestly blew me away (extended cut) Brilliant!Don't believe what the internet is telling you to think - take this from a person who has worked in the comic book industry - this is amazing!"

"When I first wrote a review for this movie a year ago exclaiming my excitement for the film, I had been high off a fresh dose of live-action DC superheroes playing out the beloved comic book stories that I had grown up on. It was all playing out before my eyes and coming to life. After a few months had passed, I began to notice things about the movie that I disliked: little gaps in the story, things that didn't add up, etc. My original rating of a 10 / 10 dropped to an 8 /10. But today it has gone back up to a 10. The extended version of the film not only rectifies the gaps but also silences critics.Many claimed that the movie was too dark or that it just didn't make sense. To those people, I say: \"Pick up a comic book!\" Many of the critics of this particular film were part of the superhero bandwagon that formed when Marvel began its spree of Avengers-related films. In fact, its estimated that over 60% of people who go to see 'superhero' genre films have never picked up a comic book in their life. I would argue that similar numbers could figure to those which view the CW televised DC Universe shows. People complain that DC comics is just too dark but the fact is that these movies are based upon actual comics which are meant to be dark (ex: The Dark Knight Returns, Injustice, etc.). Its like complaining that Game of Thrones (the TV series) sucks because they kill off too many characters. Read the books! Its frustrating to see such a beautiful work of art like Batman V Superman criticized by those ignorant to its universe and its meaning. This movie is in fact a catalyst that opens numerous doorways and leaves true fans in awe of the possibilities for future movies. But regardless of whether or not people choose to educate themselves, this film's DVD/Blu-ray extended version puts the theater release to shame. All of the plot holes and gaps are filled in 30 minutes of extended footage scattered throughout the film. The movie ultimately becomes more complete and people will wish that the movie had shown the full 3 hours of footage in its theatrical debut. As a major DC comics fan, I will of course pick up on things that a comics fan would not, but someone who does not read comics would learn to appreciate this film in its entirety with the extended version. Get your hands on a copy today or find it on Netflix or the internet somewhere!"

"I ignored the bad reviews and watched anyways. This film had a lot to live up to after Civil War was released and I went into this film expecting the worst. It ended up to be the best Superhero film of 2016 to me. One complaint was that this film was more concerned about universe building than telling a great story than Civil War but for me it was the other way around; Civil War felt like a build up to something else and to be honest, I felt that way when I saw the other MCU films. Batman vs Superman however not only had a great story, but it also felt a lot more consistent than Civil War. This film was way more diverse with the cast than the MCU but unlike the MCU, I felt like this film doesn't go overboard with the SJW stuff like the MCU films or The Star Wars Sequel films do. The Visuals were AMAZING, The Score by Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL was AMAZING as well, The Tone is just right as I actually felt for the characters emotionally, The Cinematography kept my eyes glued to the screen, and the script felt really Intelligent and Complex and despite people calling the writing confusing, I was able to piece it together with no problem whatsoever. This film is similar to Empire Strikes back in terms of popularity so over time after the other movies are released, this movie would probably be more popular.This film was way better than I Expected and deserves another chance.

"Its shame to see what critics and marvel fans did to this movie and targeted Zack Snyder for it. I have seen this movie more than 25 times till date. And i enjoy this movie as much as i enjoyed the first time. The fans who have read DC comics, wouldn't be disappointed in this movie. Its dark movie, yes it is. Because the title shows the intense situation at hand. Two superheroes about to rip each other apart for whatever reasons that brought them to this stage. Yes it had to be dark and intense.Only marvel can be stupid enough to show an alien invasion where humans are loosing the battle and the super heroes are cracking jokes while battles as if they are playing ping pong. a person playing Call of Duty game is more serious while playing than the marvel heroes fighting aliens."

"Last week some news came out from somebody online who had claimed to have seen a finished version of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. If you were like me, you've been leery of checking it out because you weren't sure how much might actually be true. Now Zack Snyder has spoken out about the spoiler-filled post, although his response doesn't really clear anything up.In a word, to MTV, he called the post \"hilarious,which might imply that he's saying that it's mostly, if not entirely, untrue. That might be the case, but then again he could have just said it was untrue and he didn't say that. What he did say, however, is that he doesn't like spoilers. While this may seem odd for the director who's most recent trailer appeared to give away the entire movie, Snyder says that's not the case. Even if you've seen the trailer, you can rest easy, as there is much more we have not seen in then finished film. Says Snyder I have the benefit of seeing the movie. It's cool that think it's too much, and I appreciate people not wanting to know, but there's plenty that they don't know. There's a lot of movie that's not in the trailer. In the process of calling the Batman v Superman Reddit review hilarious, Snyder goes on to talk about how he hates it when spoilers come out. The director would much rather that fans see the movie mostly blind. While he understands that some fans may wish to find the answers before hand, he wants his movies to be mysteries going in. If you're, as an audience member, exploring these articles, looking for answers to questions that you have, maybe you're okay with knowing before you go. It's like an individual taste. But like I said, I want people to see the movie without knowing.Spoilers are a topic that mean different things to different people. While most try to avoid them to some degree, the need to solve the mystery is a nearly universal human experience. We have an inclination to want to know the truth, even while also wanting to be surprised. For most of us getting some information is good, but getting all the information is bad, of course, only getting the details that you want can be difficult."
"The theatrical is choppy, poorly edited, hard to follow, with some really good moments mixed in their. The extended is much more fluent and is much easier to follow, it does have a long runtime, which might make it seem a bit dragging on, but if you like long films done right, like Lord of the Rings, you will like this movie as long as you get into the characters and story. Speaking of which, the story starts out perfectly showing Bruce Wayne as a character, and it is very powerful. There are several moments in this movie that are powerful, emotional, and shocking. Characters. Batman is my favorite fictional character of all time, and believe me when I say, Ben Affleck as Batman was perfect, he had the charisma, the anger, and the look of being through some bad stuff Gal Gadot also does perfect as Wonder Woman, but if you want to really see how good she does, go watch the Wonder Woman movie. Henry Call as Superman. I really don't like it when people say Christopher Reeves is better. Don't get me wrong, Reeves does great, but can you imagine him as Superman in this movie? I wouldn't like it. It would be like Adam West playing Batman in The Dark Knight. Henry Cavill does great in this role, I can say everything about him as I said with Ben Affleck. Jesse Eisenberg as Luthor. I thought it was different in a good way. I've heard a criticism for him as being too much like Joker, but is that a bad thing? Joker is my favorite villain, so to see Superman have an enemy that crazy, but still hold the values Luthor needs to be Luthor, I think it is great. The thing I thought this movie was lacking in the first and second acts was humor, at least good humor. If there was more humor, I would've given this movie a ten because it would give a more relaxing feel to the parts that needed it. All in all though, this movie was awesome, it had powerful moments, it was badass, and just plain fun. It had a great story arc and does its job very well."

"*I will be talking about the Ultimate Edition of the film* This was one of the most anticipated CBM of all time. Ever since the arrival and subsequent success of Marvel's The Avengers people have wondered when will DC launch its own cinematic universe, one of the main reasons being the opportunity to finally see titans such as Batman and Superman share the screen together: the ultimate nerd dream. On 2016, the moment finally came for BvS to be released AND.. it performed poorly. Not only did critical reception left a lot to be desired, but fan reactions where surprisingly split after its cinematic debut. People either loved it and called Zack a genius, or hated it and called him a hack. Me, personally, I found myself with middle of the road feelings, for sure, but more leaning towards the negative side with subsequent viewings. The theatrical cut of the film showcased amazing performances, incredible visuals, and action set pieces that seemed like comic book panels come to life, in a good way. However, when it comes to its narrative structure and more technical aspects like editing, the film was seriously flawed. More plot holes than Age of Ultron, questionable character decisions, random editing that lacked cohesion and focus, and forced dramatic moments that lacked any impact because the attempts at character development ranged from limited to nonexistent, especially when it comes to Superman's character. I thought it was a 5/10 movie at best. As such, I was kind of skeptical about the idea of a 30 minute longer version. I say kind of because I know how Zack works. I remember Watchmen being vastly improved with its director's cut, so in a way I was expecting BvS to perform in a similar manner, but I also feared those 30 minutes wold be just there to amplify action and discredit storytelling issues. Oh boy, I'm so glad I was proved wrong. The ultimate cut of the film was infuriating, but not because it was awful, but because it questions the sanity of WB executives and editors and makes you wonder what were they thinking during the editing process. What I got out of the Ultimate Edition was a thought-provoking deconstruction of two very iconic superheroes that gave spotlight to the struggles both of them face when they aren't fighting crime. What I got was an extremely well produced character study on both Batman and Superman in a cynical world, a world dangerously close to our own. We meet Batman as a ruthless, worn out hero that has seen the failure behind his ideals and witnessed some truly horrifying things in his life. Superman, on the other hand, is portrayed as a godlike figure that seeks to do good in the world, but finds himself emotionally conflicted once he realized that every good deed he does leaves behind a trail of destruction (most of it due to Luthor's antics). In my opinion, this is a hugely original approach, one that distances itself from the rest of the competition and delivers a dark, somber, yet relevant superhero movie that understands both characters and gives them real human struggles to deal with. I felt invested in both of them, and hoped that by the end of the film both could find a way to redeem themselves. Their character arcs were very well established during the first two acts of the movie, and by the time we get to the titular climactic battle the emotion behind the jaw-dropping action is intensified. Lex Luthor as a villain was also given more time to develop with this new edition. One of the main criticisms with the original version was the fact that his plan relied too much on conveniences, and the character's mannerisms and mad-scientist attitude was annoying, and that goes without saying his motivations were unclear. Not only do we spend more time understanding his hate for any godlike figure and thus his hatred for Superman, but the added scenes allowed us to witness his entire plan come to fruition. It sells the cold, manipulative, calculating attributes of his comic counterpart. The acting is spot on. Every actor owns his/her role, from Cavill's Superman, to Ben Affleck as Batman, Eisenberg as Luthor, and Gadot as Wonder Woman, whose scenes are brief, but are more than enough to sell the strong and ferocious warrior that she is. Cinematography is stunning, and miles above that of Man of Steel's. And the soundtrack by Zimmer and Junkie XL? Perfect, just perfect. When it comes to flaws, the film still has some of those. The Martha moment, while serving as a pivotal character moment for Batman, felt off in execution, and its understandable that many people got mad at it. If your main complaint about BvS the first time around was its bleak tone and subject matter, this film is still not for you. I understand most were expecting to see the heroes being the most iconic versions of themselves, clashing in an elongated battle and evoking the same feelings The Avengers gave audiences back in 2012. In that sense, the film will remain divisive, but at least I have the comfort of saying that, at the very least, the film is competently made."

"This film was amazing. Ben Affleck was easily the best part of this movie, he brought his a-game as Batman. The chemistry between Affleck & Irons was outstanding. Gal Gadot did a great job as Wonder Woman. The fight between Batman & Superman was awesome. The final fight with Doomsday was outstanding in every way possible. However, there is only one problem with this film and that's Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor. He was sadly missed cast in this role, but then again it's really the fault of Warner Bros. Studios. Overall, this film deliver on almost every level. I highly recommend that you watch the extended version of this film."

"I know I know. I saw it in theaters too, and felt like it could've been so much better. While the Batman element was good, the narrative felt fractured, and the third act was just one long stunt scene. Superman was relegated to a supporting character, and other characters didn't get a chance to shine. And then I chanced on the ultimate cut. Calling it 30 mins of \"extra\" footage is unfair to Zack Snyder because it's exactly these 30 mins that makes the movie a worthy one. What I can say about the theatrical cut is this - It had the blockbuster elements - music, visuals, stunts, CGI. But, it lacked the human elements. The first 20 mins of the movie had it, but not after that. The extended cut in comparison has a flow to the narrative. There are no disjointed scenes, everything flows smoothly, and there's connective tissue. Superman gets to spend some time with his father, and mother. Clark Kent does some investigative journalism. Superman helps the people after the blast. Lois Lane doesn't jump to conclusions, she gets to the bottom of the crime. Lex Luthor apparently had a coherent plan - everything is explained pretty well. Wonder Woman was already good, so there's no change there :) Also, the \"Martha\" scene seems better executed, because it is a few seconds longer, and there's time to breathe it in. So, here's my take on this movie - The theatrical cut was junk. Get the Bluray for ultimate edition, and you shall not be disappointed. I've seen it so many more times now, and it's the definitive cut. It is the movie we deserve. It's a unique take on Batman, and Superman. It's a gritty take on the superhero movie genre, and definitely the best DCEU movie, and the best DC movie since The Dark Knight.P.S. Yes it's dark. We're adults, and we should appreciate mature film making without intentionally silly moments. It attempts to be philosophical, and something deep instead of just trying to make you chuckle."

"This is one of the best superhero movies ever made. Zack Snyder is a magician behind the camera.The reason behind so many complaints is the fact that Warner Bros. marketed this movie as a fight between Batman and Superman. That's not what it is. It's a movie about the origins of the Justice League.The cinematography, the acting and the score are all second to none. This film is phenomenal.P.S: watch the 3 hour extended cut that Snyder intended you to see, not the 2 and a half hour movie that Warner Bros. decided would be better for theaters."

"I don't care what the critics say, this is a very well-done movie. I'll start my review by listing what I like about the movie.1.) Ben Affleck is the best batman to me and it is not close. He pulls off the role of an aging batman extremely well. Also, Zack Snyder's vision of batman is legit. I have always hated batman up until this adaptation of him. Instead of being a conflicted and idealistic batman, this batman is dark, gritty, and 100% a badass. His equipment is decked out with machine guns and he has no aversion to killing people. In fact, he probably kills about 50 criminal by the time this movie is over. The warehouse scene is the coolest batman scene in any movie.2.) The development of a grudge between batman and superman is pulled off flawlessly. It actually makes sense why batman dislikes superman. Then, when they do fight it is about the coolest thing you can expect to see from a superhero film. 3.) I disagree with a lot of people about Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor. In my opinion, he played his role to perfection. 4.) B v S sets up Wonder Woman and Justice League with Gal Gadot's cameo as Wonder Woman and short clips of Aquaman, the Flash, and Cyborg. B v S is one of my favorite superhero films and rewatching it never gets old."

"The theatrical cut of this film is garbage which is why I rated it eight stars instead of nine. The first time I watched this film I didn't like it (not straight out hate but didn't like). Character motivations didn't make any sense, Lex was annoying as s***, editing was sloppy, and it was overly dark and broody for an action superhero movie. A year + a half, five Marvel films, a ton of bad reviews and a Justice League later a thought popped into my head: \"what if I watched BVS again\". This time I didn't have trailers ruining the best moments, I only vaguely remembered the film, and I was conditioned to look at it negatively but something unexpected happened: I actually loved it. Superman was just a normal person that tried to make a difference cause he could that others imposed their own beliefs on. Lex Luthor was a genius that couldn't stand his powerlessness compared to Superman or more accurately a super being. As Alfred said \"The fever, the rage, the feeling of powerlessness that turns good men... cruel\" and you see the same thought process in Batman. Batman, just like Lex Luthor feels powerless in the midst of a god-being and just like Lex he attempts to destroy him so he can get his sense of power back but unlike Lex, Batman learns something. I what is one of the corniest lines of the movie Superman says, \"Martha\" when he knows he can't win against Batman in a late desperate attempt to save his mother. Not only does this name connect with Bruce Wayne but it also shows what really matters to a man of steel: it isn't power, it isn't fame or anything else, it is his Mother and on a broader scale it is people. Lex (who doesn't care about people at all) knows he doesn't have the power so he creates something from his blood and the remains of Zod: A Doomsday for Superman. Not only does this film have depth but it also doesn't always explain it to you which is rare in a blockbuster action superhero flick normally cater to semi-comic book fans and people that want to shove popcorn in their mouths. This film rewards you for really noticing the details while still having massive explosions. One of my favorites is how Lex has all of Batman's branded killed which is why he isn't afraid of the branding at the end or Grandma's Peach Tea as a way of scaring the s*** out of someone. Of course, this film isn't perfect and I do have personal dislikes. The Batman V Superman fight was slow and pretty boring especially after watching such an amazing fight in Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 2 (If you haven't watched the animated Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 1 and 2 you are sorely missing out on something fantastic). Also, the addition of Wonder Woman who pretty much steals a hacker thing, gives it back and then suits up and fights against a giant monster thing. Not to say I don't like Wonder Woman (She is one of my favorite Superheroes of all time who showed not only can woman kick a** but they also don't need to be ashamed of their sexuality or gender) but she wasn't really that helpful to the plot and just brought in to expand the universe which was well done through Lex's superhuman hunting files. Also, the post-apocalyptic scene that was just a dream could have been cut but nothing is perfect except movies like Citizen Kane which isn't a lot of fun to watch cause it is too perfect. So to summarize, the theatrical cut is bad, the ultimate cut is Amazing and the other cut is meh. Please give it a second chance because it deserves it and save a good director from losing grace because of something he didn't do."
"I really liked it, don't know what all the hate is about. I'm actually a Marvel fan from when I was 7 or so, but Superman and Batman together in 1 movie? Just great. And personally I like Ben Affleck even better than Christian Bale as Batman. So just watch and enjoy, I know I did!"

"That's right. We have been waiting for these two heroes to finally meet and fight against each other. This movie is so good in both plot and special effects.Henry Cavill and Ben Affleck have performed well in their acting stages. They are the best superhero actors and they have filmed their fighting scenes very well. The movie starts to show the conflict between the lives of the heroes and now they have blamed each other for it. This movie is amazing and sets up a good plot for Dawn Justice."

"Actually...I didn't know what to expect. When you see Wonder Woman, you know it will be off of Wonder Woman and off of a Wonder Woman story, but with Batman V Superman, I was like, \"hmmmm, so who is this about?\" It was pretty obvious that it would feature many characters, but I thought the introduction to Batman was amazing. Ben Affleck nailed the part, not only as Batman but also as Bruce Wayne. He is my Batman. Henry Cavill continued to be super as the Man of Steel. And he is my Super - Man. A dark story? Yes, without a doubt. Could it have had a few more jokes? Sure. But not all movies or stories need to have jokes when certain events are serious. I really hope people can see this review and take another look at the movie, because, I loved it. I really hope the ratings can go up, eventually. And P.S, this movie is the perfect set up to Justice League."

"This film is crucial to the extended universe that DC is trying to build, but it feels highly derivative of better stories and continues to demonstrate the misuse of the iconic characters mentioned in the title. Plus Jesse Eisenberg feels wildly mis-casted."

"I'll start by making it clear I have only ever seen the Ultimate Edition. I'm aware of what was cut out for the theatrical release, so I will concede up front that most of the criticisms about pacing, editing, and missing bits of plot at release were merited.With that caveat out of the way, I must reiterate that this was bar-none the boldest superhero movie I have ever seen. To me, it was arguably the best as well, though \"best\" shouldn't be taken to mean \"most enjoyable.\" That honor easily goes to \"Thor: Ragnarok.\" What makes BvS stand out among other films in the genre is that it takes two characters who have been done to death since the 1970s and brings them up to date. I recently tried to watch \"Superman: The Movie\" for the first time in a number of years, and while it was still good and Reeves will always be iconic, I just couldn't take it seriously. I'll put it this way: If the story in BvS was \"stupid\" in your view but Superman turning back time by spinning the earth backward on its axis didn't seem like one of the dumbest things you have ever seen -in any movie from any genre- to the extent that it outright ruins the movie for you, then your opinion about BvS isn't worth much. Nostalgic bias was always going to be a problem for this movie, and the way people reacted to and reviewed \"Man of Steel\" was telling in this regard.That brings me to Zack Snyder's take on Superman. You know, that guy whose status as the first extraterrestrial ever encountered by humanity was a total non-issue in the old movies. Apparently, Snyder has a similar view to my own in that his take on the Man of Steel makes his being an alien a core piece of his identity. He may look like any other (absurdly attractive) person, but he knows what he is, and that makes him perpetually uncertain of where he fits in this world. He is essentially good and really does care about people, but he struggles to truly empathize with the likes of us. To be human is to be frail, and that is not something he can easily relate to. This is the root of his conflict with Batman.Just as Clark struggles to genuinely relate to most people, Snyder's Batman either refuses to or otherwise just can't relate to Superman. He doesn't see him as anything but a threat regardless of Superman's clear good intentions. Remember, a small group of Kryptonians were able to bring humanity to the brink of extinction in less than a day, and Bruce Wayne is nothing if not a realist. He didn't know the guy from Kansas. He only knew the god from another world.While Batman's anger toward and fear of Superman are readily apparent from the start, Superman's inability to imagine things from Bruce Wayne's perspective only becomes truly apparent during their first real interaction. This reminded me of the animated version of the \"world's finest\" storyline, where Superman judges Batman harshly for using fear tactics and threats of violence (also, actual violence) to get the job done. Superman wasn't willing to consider what it would take for a human man to fight criminals and save innocents, or what that life would do to him over time. Just as Batman didn't see the guy from Kansas, Superman didn't see the man who lives his life trapped in one brutal, unthinkably traumatic moment (this was beautifully conveyed during the film's opening moments), and had spent his whole adult life bearing witness to humanity at its absolute worst.The conflict between these two characters is as old as human history. They want the same things, but they can't understand one another. So they fight. And what a fight it was.Watching a fight between, say, Captain America and Iron Man was, to me, more frustrating than anything because each understood the other's perspective perfectly. The fight between Batman and Superman in BvS was genuinely gut-wrenching, as intended, because they would have understood one another if either had tried. The whole sequence hilighted Batman's tactical prowess and ability to control a situation. Maybe the most badass thing about the fight was that it ended exactly where Batman planned. That brings me to the big elephant in the room named \"Martha.\"I can't recall exactly which YouTuber put it this way, but if you thought the \"save Martha\" exchange was about their mothers having the same name, you had your brain turned off. The brain-on people have explained this to death, but it bears repeating. This was the moment when Superman became humanized to Batman. He was about to die, and his only concern was for his adoptive human mother. He still believed that the man about to take his life would do the right thing. Even with the cowl on, there was no mistaking the look on Batman's face. It was the look of shame, guilt, and sudden uncertainty that says \"What am I doing?\" Turns out even the most brutal, angry version of Bruce Wayne is better than Tony Stark at knowing right from wrong. At knowing that he had gone too far.From there, the third act was a series of truly impressive (albeit mostly CGI) fight sequences, beginning with what I regard as the undisputed champion of Batman fights. Nothing in the Nolan movies (and especially nothing in the Burton movies) even came close. Go ahead, try to convince yourself that Batman and Bane taking turns punching one another in the face until Bane's mask broke was a good fight sequence. No, this was a fight straight out of \"Arkham Knight,\" and it was glorious. The battle against Doomsday really was one for the books. From the moment Wonder Woman arrived accompanied by the intense sounds of Tina Guo's electric cello to Superman's tragic, heroic death at the hands of Doomsday, I was glued to the screen. Sure, the mere presence of Doomsday spoiled the end to a degree, but watching the Man of Steel laboring to carry that kryptonite spear towards certain death was no less impactful. A brief word on Jesse Eisenberg's take on Lex Luthor. At least one other reviewer on this site already said it best when they pointed out that this was his origin story. If you consider his scheme objectively, he is actually one of the more formidable incarnations of the character. If we're lucky, we'll eventually get to see a Snyder Cut of \"Justice League\" and find out where this story was actually meant to go. For the record, Joss Whedon and Danny Elfman both should have said \"no\" to taking a dump on someone else's art."
"BATMAN V SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE brings a fantastic surprise to a smash-hit team-up with one of the worlds most beloved DC Comics' icons of all time. The movie delivers spectacular casting, and fantastic acting with different characters having their shine in each scenes.The story follows Clark Kent/Superman who becomes a threat, after the destruction in Metropolis in Man Of Steel.(2013). Batman/Bruce Wayne sees him as a threat and begins his war on Superman.The movie brings spectacular storytelling, it tells the complications of human against alien who are on the same side, and the first meeting of Batman and Superman. The story of Bruce Wayne, with his many years of The Caped Crusader, sends him on a spiral of \"out of control\", sheer anger, and builds tension to wanting to defeat the Man of Steel. Snyder has fantastically gave this storytelling an exciting nod to the comics.Lex Luthor, played by Jesse Einsberg, delivers a very interesting performance, but very differently by him showing is his \"origin\" before he becomes a bald foe to the Man of Steel. He shows that his love of \"god vs man\" terrorises mankind when he ultimately creates Doomsday, and Batman realises Superman's inner heroism.It packs so many great \"out of nowhere\" excitement, including a first-look of the fearful Wonder Woman a.k.a. Diana Prince, played by Gal Gadot, and a fresh-new glimpse of the superhero DC canon: The Justice League.WATCH THIS MOVIE! The critics are out of their mind. It's a fun-packed action adventure which still keeps the movie enjoyable until it's final minutes of the movie. It's a FANTASTIC MOVIE! BEN AFFLECK AS BATMAN... is Incredible!A 10/10 overall!"
"I want to go on record as saying that this is a truly thrilling cinematic experience in so many ways. If pressed, I guess I could acknowledge that there were a couple ... let's say \"clumsy\" moments. And in a film that runs to three hours, that hardly seems like a significant issue, certainly not enough to rate it with fewer than 9 stars.This film has everything. There is dramatic tension right from the start. There is a magnificent story arc that picks up quite seamlessly from 'Man of Steel' and propels the viewer not only into the life of Clark Kent/Superman but also of Bruce Wayne/Batman.The villain is no mere cartoon of a villain; he is truly thoroughly (and apparently irrevocably) diabolical. He is a psychopath, and you wish for his death over and over and over. You want Superman to reduce him to ash with the power of his eyes.I have read a number of viewers' reviews, and it seems that the people who disliked the film / gave it a low rating had rather unfair and unrealistic expectations of it. That is, their own prejudices about how the plot could/should unfold or what the character development could/should be, etc. ruined the film for them. And that is a shame.My thought is: I settle into my seat, wait for the lights to dim, and then I wait to be transported by the film. I accept it, lock, stock, and barrel.As another reviewer remarked, I love how the film begins from the point of view of Bruce Wayne as he is among people on the ground who have fallen victim to the attack of Zod and the other Kryptonians.Why would Bruce Wayne not like Superman? Why would the good people of Earth hurl insults at Superman and burn him in effigy (on the news)? Because the good people of Earth just got catapulted into a new reality in which there are not only extraterrestrial beings (surprise!) but they are also superman! And a group of them are hell-bent on destroying humankind and taking the planet for themselves.It is difficult to see Superman as separate from the whole Kryptonian Krew.It seems that many moviegoers forgot that Bruce Wayne is also human. Sure, he's a hero, but he is flawed.. Just like the rest of us. He is a vigilante, after all.He has let his vigilantism get the better of him. HE is actually the one working outside the boundaries of the law, not Superman. It is the clear head of Alfred that shows us that he has gone into a rather dark place, that he has not seen what is really going on (in Luthor's scheme), and so he chooses to embark on his own scheme scheme to take out the alien invader. He is (allegedly) thinking of the future: if he wipes out the all-powerful alien, then it can't turn on humankind in the future. At least, he convinces himself of that.A philosophical question is raised in the film: should Clark Kent have remained a simple man from Kansas and never have become the Superman? Should he just let people die and let calamities happen? The question is answered for us in the character of Diana Prince/Wonder Woman. She withdrew from mankind (her exact words) and just sat around watching. Watching while people died horrible deaths all around her. So, should Superman have done the same? Do these special beings, these 'metahumans', have some kind of moral imperative to intervene, or should they be allowed to be regular people, too? It seems that humans want it both ways.It seems that humans are saying: \"Don't be a superalien ... except when I and my friends and family are in trouble. Then come save us.\""

"Batman v Superman: Ultimate Edition: If your looking for a quick, cheap thrill then you might not enjoy this film at the time. This movies theatrical version was butchered by WB and in doing so reshaped the story leaving numerous plot holes. So the Ultimate Edition is the full story and the one worth seeing. Watch 'Man of Steel' before seeing this movie. There is much to claw through here, so much so that the audience might easily find themselves exhausted from the overall aggression of the film. However, a lot of the story does work. The action is good, and the emotion feels real most of the time.This film is about Superman trying to become Superman. Trying to help the world, save people, find a place in this world not as an outcast, and yet is looked at has a threat by many. Superman is not from this world, yet He is trying to be human, find a place in this world, be excepted by earths people, and come into his destiny.This film is also about Batman being Batman for 20 years and losing faith in humanity, and fearing Superman, what Superman can do with his powers. Great film, great plot, great visuals. ---Yidioo"
"I didn't see the film in the theaters and just bought the \"Extended Edition \" on Amazon. I never properly saw Man of Steel- i think I rented it and watched it when already exhausted and fell asleep. I saw the mediocre user reviews and horrible reviews from critics of this film.They really have it wrong. This is the very best either Batman or Superman. It has a different take, on things. Much darker then earlier films even darker then the Christopher Nolan Batman films.First of all Christopher Nolan is an Executive Producer. So how bad could it be? I loved Sucker Punch and Zack Snyder was involved with that. So how bad could this be? Hans Zimmer did the music, so how bad could it be?I remember watching the old Superman TV shows and reading the Superman and Batman comics as a little kid and loved them, but i wouldn't call myself a \"fan boy\" of comic universes, like so many younger people today. As an older adult I will admit my favorite TV show of all time was Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but watched it on DVD only after it had finished. I saw the second of the Dark Knight series in the theater, but the other two, I watched on DVD. They were great, but not my favorite films like so many people. i also loved the first couple Superman and Batman films in the older series. Regardless, i was not waiting with baited breath to see Man of Steel or this one.I'm more of a serious film fan, who can watch Stanley Kubrick films over and over and my favorite films in the last twenty years, are Eyes Wide Shut and Intersteller, both of which i've watched multiple times.So, with that said, take it from me, the critics have this film very wrong, just as critics hated 2001: A Space Odyssey when it first came out. This film will have lasting appreciation.Surprised how much I liked Ben Afleck's Batman. it was hard to get into Henry Cavil's scrawnier looking Superman, but it grew on me. Amy Adams was great as Lois Lane, The Gal Gadol Wonder Women was amazing. Lex Luther was terrific, like Nolan's Joker. Jeremy Irons was the best Alfred ever. Holly Hunter and Diane Lane was good too. The movie had bad reviews but made a billion dollars. Hopefully everyone buys the Ultimate Edition and it breaks sales records and the film is re-appreciated. I have no idea what scenes this Ultimate Edition added, but it is pretty perfect. Now I can't wait for Wonder Woman and the Justice League and as soon as I finish writing this am going to watch Man of Steal. I'm into it now!I can only surmise that the bad reviews stem from too much expectations of the rigid fan boy types and the radical changes in tone, we see in this film.Total masterpiece of cinema, but I have a few criticisms. There are a few hollow scenes of typical Idiot cops and authorities getting everything wrong in a cliché type way and it has a few filler scenes of that type and a few moments here and there that felt rushed and cheesy. Maybe not everything restored into the Ultimate Edition should have been. I wish there had been more Kevin Costner scenes."

"The whole entire Batman V Superman movie was great and yes even though it felt slow to the majority of the people who watched it but to me I enjoyed every part and every scene of Batman V Superman and when it got to the fight scenes both batman VS Superman and the Doomsday fight it brought so much drama, intensity, and epic performances. So with that being said I give this movie a good 10/10 because it really did go to my expectations and it brought a powerful performance and a powerful yet epic introduction to the upcoming Justice League."

"When I first wrote a review for this movie a year ago exclaiming my excitement for the film, I had been high off a fresh dose of live-action DC superheroes playing out the beloved comic book stories that I had grown up on. It was all playing out before my eyes and coming to life. After a few months had passed, I began to notice things about the movie that I disliked: little gaps in the story, things that didn't add up, etc. My original rating of a 10 / 10 dropped to an 8 /10. But today it has gone back up to a 10. The extended version of the film not only rectifies the gaps but also silences critics.Many claimed that the movie was too dark or that it just didn't make sense. To those people, I say: \"Pick up a comic book!\" Many of the critics of this particular film were part of the superhero bandwagon that formed when Marvel began its spree of Avengers-related films. In fact, its estimated that over 60% of people who go to see 'superhero' genre films have never picked up a comic book in their life. I would argue that similar numbers could figure to those which view the CW televised DC Universe shows. People complain that DC comics is just too dark but the fact is that these movies are based upon actual comics which are meant to be dark (ex: The Dark Knight Returns, Injustice, etc.). Its like complaining that Game of Thrones (the TV series) sucks because they kill off too many characters. Read the books! Its frustrating to see such a beautiful work of art like Batman V Superman criticized by those ignorant to its universe and its meaning. This movie is in fact a catalyst that opens numerous doorways and leaves true fans in awe of the possibilities for future movies. But regardless of whether or not people choose to educate themselves, this film's DVD/Blu-ray extended version puts the theater release to shame. All of the plot holes and gaps are filled in 30 minutes of extended footage scattered throughout the film. The movie ultimately becomes more complete and people will wish that the movie had shown the full 3 hours of footage in its theatrical debut. As a major DC comics fan, I will of course pick up on things that a comics fan would not, but someone who does not read comics would learn to appreciate this film in its entirety with the extended version. Get your hands on a copy today or find it on Netflix or the internet somewhere!"

"I ignored the bad reviews and watched anyways. This film had a lot to live up to after Civil War was released and I went into this film expecting the worst. It ended up to be the best Superhero film of 2016 to me. One complaint was that this film was more concerned about universe building than telling a great story than Civil War but for me it was the other way around; Civil War felt like a build up to something else and to be honest, I felt that way when I saw the other MCU films. Batman vs Superman however not only had a great story, but it also felt a lot more consistent than Civil War. This film was way more diverse with the cast than the MCU but unlike the MCU, I felt like this film doesn't go overboard with the SJW stuff like the MCU films or The Star Wars Sequel films do. The Visuals were AMAZING, The Score by Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL was AMAZING as well, The Tone is just right as I actually felt for the characters emotionally, The Cinematography kept my eyes glued to the screen, and the script felt really Intelligent and Complex and despite people calling the writing confusing, I was able to piece it together with no problem whatsoever. This film is similar to Empire Strikes back in terms of popularity so over time after the other movies are released, this movie would probably be more popular.This film was way better than I Expected and deserves another chance.

"Its shame to see what critics and marvel fans did to this movie and targeted Zack Snyder for it. I have seen this movie more than 25 times till date. And i enjoy this movie as much as i enjoyed the first time. The fans who have read DC comics, wouldn't be disappointed in this movie. Its dark movie, yes it is. Because the title shows the intense situation at hand. Two superheroes about to rip each other apart for whatever reasons that brought them to this stage. Yes it had to be dark and intense.Only marvel can be stupid enough to show an alien invasion where humans are loosing the battle and the super heroes are cracking jokes while battles as if they are playing ping pong. a person playing Call of Duty game is more serious while playing than the marvel heroes fighting aliens."

"Last week some news came out from somebody online who had claimed to have seen a finished version of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. If you were like me, you've been leery of checking it out because you weren't sure how much might actually be true. Now Zack Snyder has spoken out about the spoiler-filled post, although his response doesn't really clear anything up.In a word, to MTV, he called the post \"hilarious,which might imply that he's saying that it's mostly, if not entirely, untrue. That might be the case, but then again he could have just said it was untrue and he didn't say that. What he did say, however, is that he doesn't like spoilers. While this may seem odd for the director who's most recent trailer appeared to give away the entire movie, Snyder says that's not the case. Even if you've seen the trailer, you can rest easy, as there is much more we have not seen in then finished film. Says Snyder I have the benefit of seeing the movie. It's cool that think it's too much, and I appreciate people not wanting to know, but there's plenty that they don't know. There's a lot of movie that's not in the trailer. In the process of calling the Batman v Superman Reddit review hilarious, Snyder goes on to talk about how he hates it when spoilers come out. The director would much rather that fans see the movie mostly blind. While he understands that some fans may wish to find the answers before hand, he wants his movies to be mysteries going in. If you're, as an audience member, exploring these articles, looking for answers to questions that you have, maybe you're okay with knowing before you go. It's like an individual taste. But like I said, I want people to see the movie without knowing.Spoilers are a topic that mean different things to different people. While most try to avoid them to some degree, the need to solve the mystery is a nearly universal human experience. We have an inclination to want to know the truth, even while also wanting to be surprised. For most of us getting some information is good, but getting all the information is bad, of course, only getting the details that you want can be difficult."
"The theatrical is choppy, poorly edited, hard to follow, with some really good moments mixed in their. The extended is much more fluent and is much easier to follow, it does have a long runtime, which might make it seem a bit dragging on, but if you like long films done right, like Lord of the Rings, you will like this movie as long as you get into the characters and story. Speaking of which, the story starts out perfectly showing Bruce Wayne as a character, and it is very powerful. There are several moments in this movie that are powerful, emotional, and shocking. Characters. Batman is my favorite fictional character of all time, and believe me when I say, Ben Affleck as Batman was perfect, he had the charisma, the anger, and the look of being through some bad stuff Gal Gadot also does perfect as Wonder Woman, but if you want to really see how good she does, go watch the Wonder Woman movie. Henry Call as Superman. I really don't like it when people say Christopher Reeves is better. Don't get me wrong, Reeves does great, but can you imagine him as Superman in this movie? I wouldn't like it. It would be like Adam West playing Batman in The Dark Knight. Henry Cavill does great in this role, I can say everything about him as I said with Ben Affleck. Jesse Eisenberg as Luthor. I thought it was different in a good way. I've heard a criticism for him as being too much like Joker, but is that a bad thing? Joker is my favorite villain, so to see Superman have an enemy that crazy, but still hold the values Luthor needs to be Luthor, I think it is great. The thing I thought this movie was lacking in the first and second acts was humor, at least good humor. If there was more humor, I would've given this movie a ten because it would give a more relaxing feel to the parts that needed it. All in all though, this movie was awesome, it had powerful moments, it was badass, and just plain fun. It had a great story arc and does its job very well."

"*I will be talking about the Ultimate Edition of the film* This was one of the most anticipated CBM of all time. Ever since the arrival and subsequent success of Marvel's The Avengers people have wondered when will DC launch its own cinematic universe, one of the main reasons being the opportunity to finally see titans such as Batman and Superman share the screen together: the ultimate nerd dream. On 2016, the moment finally came for BvS to be released AND.. it performed poorly. Not only did critical reception left a lot to be desired, but fan reactions where surprisingly split after its cinematic debut. People either loved it and called Zack a genius, or hated it and called him a hack. Me, personally, I found myself with middle of the road feelings, for sure, but more leaning towards the negative side with subsequent viewings. The theatrical cut of the film showcased amazing performances, incredible visuals, and action set pieces that seemed like comic book panels come to life, in a good way. However, when it comes to its narrative structure and more technical aspects like editing, the film was seriously flawed. More plot holes than Age of Ultron, questionable character decisions, random editing that lacked cohesion and focus, and forced dramatic moments that lacked any impact because the attempts at character development ranged from limited to nonexistent, especially when it comes to Superman's character. I thought it was a 5/10 movie at best. As such, I was kind of skeptical about the idea of a 30 minute longer version. I say kind of because I know how Zack works. I remember Watchmen being vastly improved with its director's cut, so in a way I was expecting BvS to perform in a similar manner, but I also feared those 30 minutes wold be just there to amplify action and discredit storytelling issues. Oh boy, I'm so glad I was proved wrong. The ultimate cut of the film was infuriating, but not because it was awful, but because it questions the sanity of WB executives and editors and makes you wonder what were they thinking during the editing process. What I got out of the Ultimate Edition was a thought-provoking deconstruction of two very iconic superheroes that gave spotlight to the struggles both of them face when they aren't fighting crime. What I got was an extremely well produced character study on both Batman and Superman in a cynical world, a world dangerously close to our own. We meet Batman as a ruthless, worn out hero that has seen the failure behind his ideals and witnessed some truly horrifying things in his life. Superman, on the other hand, is portrayed as a godlike figure that seeks to do good in the world, but finds himself emotionally conflicted once he realized that every good deed he does leaves behind a trail of destruction (most of it due to Luthor's antics). In my opinion, this is a hugely original approach, one that distances itself from the rest of the competition and delivers a dark, somber, yet relevant superhero movie that understands both characters and gives them real human struggles to deal with. I felt invested in both of them, and hoped that by the end of the film both could find a way to redeem themselves. Their character arcs were very well established during the first two acts of the movie, and by the time we get to the titular climactic battle the emotion behind the jaw-dropping action is intensified. Lex Luthor as a villain was also given more time to develop with this new edition. One of the main criticisms with the original version was the fact that his plan relied too much on conveniences, and the character's mannerisms and mad-scientist attitude was annoying, and that goes without saying his motivations were unclear. Not only do we spend more time understanding his hate for any godlike figure and thus his hatred for Superman, but the added scenes allowed us to witness his entire plan come to fruition. It sells the cold, manipulative, calculating attributes of his comic counterpart. The acting is spot on. Every actor owns his/her role, from Cavill's Superman, to Ben Affleck as Batman, Eisenberg as Luthor, and Gadot as Wonder Woman, whose scenes are brief, but are more than enough to sell the strong and ferocious warrior that she is. Cinematography is stunning, and miles above that of Man of Steel's. And the soundtrack by Zimmer and Junkie XL? Perfect, just perfect. When it comes to flaws, the film still has some of those. The Martha moment, while serving as a pivotal character moment for Batman, felt off in execution, and its understandable that many people got mad at it. If your main complaint about BvS the first time around was its bleak tone and subject matter, this film is still not for you. I understand most were expecting to see the heroes being the most iconic versions of themselves, clashing in an elongated battle and evoking the same feelings The Avengers gave audiences back in 2012. In that sense, the film will remain divisive, but at least I have the comfort of saying that, at the very least, the film is competently made."

"This film was amazing. Ben Affleck was easily the best part of this movie, he brought his a-game as Batman. The chemistry between Affleck & Irons was outstanding. Gal Gadot did a great job as Wonder Woman. The fight between Batman & Superman was awesome. The final fight with Doomsday was outstanding in every way possible. However, there is only one problem with this film and that's Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor. He was sadly missed cast in this role, but then again it's really the fault of Warner Bros. Studios. Overall, this film deliver on almost every level. I highly recommend that you watch the extended version of this film."

"I know I know. I saw it in theaters too, and felt like it could've been so much better. While the Batman element was good, the narrative felt fractured, and the third act was just one long stunt scene. Superman was relegated to a supporting character, and other characters didn't get a chance to shine. And then I chanced on the ultimate cut. Calling it 30 mins of \"extra\" footage is unfair to Zack Snyder because it's exactly these 30 mins that makes the movie a worthy one. What I can say about the theatrical cut is this - It had the blockbuster elements - music, visuals, stunts, CGI. But, it lacked the human elements. The first 20 mins of the movie had it, but not after that. The extended cut in comparison has a flow to the narrative. There are no disjointed scenes, everything flows smoothly, and there's connective tissue. Superman gets to spend some time with his father, and mother. Clark Kent does some investigative journalism. Superman helps the people after the blast. Lois Lane doesn't jump to conclusions, she gets to the bottom of the crime. Lex Luthor apparently had a coherent plan - everything is explained pretty well. Wonder Woman was already good, so there's no change there :) Also, the \"Martha\" scene seems better executed, because it is a few seconds longer, and there's time to breathe it in. So, here's my take on this movie - The theatrical cut was junk. Get the Bluray for ultimate edition, and you shall not be disappointed. I've seen it so many more times now, and it's the definitive cut. It is the movie we deserve. It's a unique take on Batman, and Superman. It's a gritty take on the superhero movie genre, and definitely the best DCEU movie, and the best DC movie since The Dark Knight.P.S. Yes it's dark. We're adults, and we should appreciate mature film making without intentionally silly moments. It attempts to be philosophical, and something deep instead of just trying to make you chuckle."

"This is one of the best superhero movies ever made. Zack Snyder is a magician behind the camera.The reason behind so many complaints is the fact that Warner Bros. marketed this movie as a fight between Batman and Superman. That's not what it is. It's a movie about the origins of the Justice League.The cinematography, the acting and the score are all second to none. This film is phenomenal.P.S: watch the 3 hour extended cut that Snyder intended you to see, not the 2 and a half hour movie that Warner Bros. decided would be better for theaters."

"I don't care what the critics say, this is a very well-done movie. I'll start my review by listing what I like about the movie.1.) Ben Affleck is the best batman to me and it is not close. He pulls off the role of an aging batman extremely well. Also, Zack Snyder's vision of batman is legit. I have always hated batman up until this adaptation of him. Instead of being a conflicted and idealistic batman, this batman is dark, gritty, and 100% a badass. His equipment is decked out with machine guns and he has no aversion to killing people. In fact, he probably kills about 50 criminal by the time this movie is over. The warehouse scene is the coolest batman scene in any movie.2.) The development of a grudge between batman and superman is pulled off flawlessly. It actually makes sense why batman dislikes superman. Then, when they do fight it is about the coolest thing you can expect to see from a superhero film. 3.) I disagree with a lot of people about Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor. In my opinion, he played his role to perfection. 4.) B v S sets up Wonder Woman and Justice League with Gal Gadot's cameo as Wonder Woman and short clips of Aquaman, the Flash, and Cyborg. B v S is one of my favorite superhero films and rewatching it never gets old."

"The theatrical cut of this film is garbage which is why I rated it eight stars instead of nine. The first time I watched this film I didn't like it (not straight out hate but didn't like). Character motivations didn't make any sense, Lex was annoying as s***, editing was sloppy, and it was overly dark and broody for an action superhero movie. A year + a half, five Marvel films, a ton of bad reviews and a Justice League later a thought popped into my head: \"what if I watched BVS again\". This time I didn't have trailers ruining the best moments, I only vaguely remembered the film, and I was conditioned to look at it negatively but something unexpected happened: I actually loved it. Superman was just a normal person that tried to make a difference cause he could that others imposed their own beliefs on. Lex Luthor was a genius that couldn't stand his powerlessness compared to Superman or more accurately a super being. As Alfred said \"The fever, the rage, the feeling of powerlessness that turns good men... cruel\" and you see the same thought process in Batman. Batman, just like Lex Luthor feels powerless in the midst of a god-being and just like Lex he attempts to destroy him so he can get his sense of power back but unlike Lex, Batman learns something. I what is one of the corniest lines of the movie Superman says, \"Martha\" when he knows he can't win against Batman in a late desperate attempt to save his mother. Not only does this name connect with Bruce Wayne but it also shows what really matters to a man of steel: it isn't power, it isn't fame or anything else, it is his Mother and on a broader scale it is people. Lex (who doesn't care about people at all) knows he doesn't have the power so he creates something from his blood and the remains of Zod: A Doomsday for Superman. Not only does this film have depth but it also doesn't always explain it to you which is rare in a blockbuster action superhero flick normally cater to semi-comic book fans and people that want to shove popcorn in their mouths. This film rewards you for really noticing the details while still having massive explosions. One of my favorites is how Lex has all of Batman's branded killed which is why he isn't afraid of the branding at the end or Grandma's Peach Tea as a way of scaring the s*** out of someone. Of course, this film isn't perfect and I do have personal dislikes. The Batman V Superman fight was slow and pretty boring especially after watching such an amazing fight in Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 2 (If you haven't watched the animated Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 1 and 2 you are sorely missing out on something fantastic). Also, the addition of Wonder Woman who pretty much steals a hacker thing, gives it back and then suits up and fights against a giant monster thing. Not to say I don't like Wonder Woman (She is one of my favorite Superheroes of all time who showed not only can woman kick a** but they also don't need to be ashamed of their sexuality or gender) but she wasn't really that helpful to the plot and just brought in to expand the universe which was well done through Lex's superhuman hunting files. Also, the post-apocalyptic scene that was just a dream could have been cut but nothing is perfect except movies like Citizen Kane which isn't a lot of fun to watch cause it is too perfect. So to summarize, the theatrical cut is bad, the ultimate cut is Amazing and the other cut is meh. Please give it a second chance because it deserves it and save a good director from losing grace because of something he didn't do."
"I really liked it, don't know what all the hate is about. I'm actually a Marvel fan from when I was 7 or so, but Superman and Batman together in 1 movie? Just great. And personally I like Ben Affleck even better than Christian Bale as Batman. So just watch and enjoy, I know I did!"

"That's right. We have been waiting for these two heroes to finally meet and fight against each other. This movie is so good in both plot and special effects.Henry Cavill and Ben Affleck have performed well in their acting stages. They are the best superhero actors and they have filmed their fighting scenes very well. The movie starts to show the conflict between the lives of the heroes and now they have blamed each other for it. This movie is amazing and sets up a good plot for Dawn Justice."

"Actually...I didn't know what to expect. When you see Wonder Woman, you know it will be off of Wonder Woman and off of a Wonder Woman story, but with Batman V Superman, I was like, \"hmmmm, so who is this about?\" It was pretty obvious that it would feature many characters, but I thought the introduction to Batman was amazing. Ben Affleck nailed the part, not only as Batman but also as Bruce Wayne. He is my Batman. Henry Cavill continued to be super as the Man of Steel. And he is my Super - Man. A dark story? Yes, without a doubt. Could it have had a few more jokes? Sure. But not all movies or stories need to have jokes when certain events are serious. I really hope people can see this review and take another look at the movie, because, I loved it. I really hope the ratings can go up, eventually. And P.S, this movie is the perfect set up to Justice League."

"I'll start by making it clear I have only ever seen the Ultimate Edition. I'm aware of what was cut out for the theatrical release, so I will concede up front that most of the criticisms about pacing, editing, and missing bits of plot at release were merited.With that caveat out of the way, I must reiterate that this was bar-none the boldest superhero movie I have ever seen. To me, it was arguably the best as well, though \"best\" shouldn't be taken to mean \"most enjoyable.\" That honor easily goes to \"Thor: Ragnarok.\" What makes BvS stand out among other films in the genre is that it takes two characters who have been done to death since the 1970s and brings them up to date. I recently tried to watch \"Superman: The Movie\" for the first time in a number of years, and while it was still good and Reeves will always be iconic, I just couldn't take it seriously. I'll put it this way: If the story in BvS was \"stupid\" in your view but Superman turning back time by spinning the earth backward on its axis didn't seem like one of the dumbest things you have ever seen -in any movie from any genre- to the extent that it outright ruins the movie for you, then your opinion about BvS isn't worth much. Nostalgic bias was always going to be a problem for this movie, and the way people reacted to and reviewed \"Man of Steel\" was telling in this regard.That brings me to Zack Snyder's take on Superman. You know, that guy whose status as the first extraterrestrial ever encountered by humanity was a total non-issue in the old movies. Apparently, Snyder has a similar view to my own in that his take on the Man of Steel makes his being an alien a core piece of his identity. He may look like any other (absurdly attractive) person, but he knows what he is, and that makes him perpetually uncertain of where he fits in this world. He is essentially good and really does care about people, but he struggles to truly empathize with the likes of us. To be human is to be frail, and that is not something he can easily relate to. This is the root of his conflict with Batman.Just as Clark struggles to genuinely relate to most people, Snyder's Batman either refuses to or otherwise just can't relate to Superman. He doesn't see him as anything but a threat regardless of Superman's clear good intentions. Remember, a small group of Kryptonians were able to bring humanity to the brink of extinction in less than a day, and Bruce Wayne is nothing if not a realist. He didn't know the guy from Kansas. He only knew the god from another world.While Batman's anger toward and fear of Superman are readily apparent from the start, Superman's inability to imagine things from Bruce Wayne's perspective only becomes truly apparent during their first real interaction. This reminded me of the animated version of the \"world's finest\" storyline, where Superman judges Batman harshly for using fear tactics and threats of violence (also, actual violence) to get the job done. Superman wasn't willing to consider what it would take for a human man to fight criminals and save innocents, or what that life would do to him over time. Just as Batman didn't see the guy from Kansas, Superman didn't see the man who lives his life trapped in one brutal, unthinkably traumatic moment (this was beautifully conveyed during the film's opening moments), and had spent his whole adult life bearing witness to humanity at its absolute worst.The conflict between these two characters is as old as human history. They want the same things, but they can't understand one another. So they fight. And what a fight it was.Watching a fight between, say, Captain America and Iron Man was, to me, more frustrating than anything because each understood the other's perspective perfectly. The fight between Batman and Superman in BvS was genuinely gut-wrenching, as intended, because they would have understood one another if either had tried. The whole sequence hilighted Batman's tactical prowess and ability to control a situation. Maybe the most badass thing about the fight was that it ended exactly where Batman planned. That brings me to the big elephant in the room named \"Martha.\"I can't recall exactly which YouTuber put it this way, but if you thought the \"save Martha\" exchange was about their mothers having the same name, you had your brain turned off. The brain-on people have explained this to death, but it bears repeating. This was the moment when Superman became humanized to Batman. He was about to die, and his only concern was for his adoptive human mother. He still believed that the man about to take his life would do the right thing. Even with the cowl on, there was no mistaking the look on Batman's face. It was the look of shame, guilt, and sudden uncertainty that says \"What am I doing?\" Turns out even the most brutal, angry version of Bruce Wayne is better than Tony Stark at knowing right from wrong. At knowing that he had gone too far.From there, the third act was a series of truly impressive (albeit mostly CGI) fight sequences, beginning with what I regard as the undisputed champion of Batman fights. Nothing in the Nolan movies (and especially nothing in the Burton movies) even came close. Go ahead, try to convince yourself that Batman and Bane taking turns punching one another in the face until Bane's mask broke was a good fight sequence. No, this was a fight straight out of \"Arkham Knight,\" and it was glorious. The battle against Doomsday really was one for the books. From the moment Wonder Woman arrived accompanied by the intense sounds of Tina Guo's electric cello to Superman's tragic, heroic death at the hands of Doomsday, I was glued to the screen. Sure, the mere presence of Doomsday spoiled the end to a degree, but watching the Man of Steel laboring to carry that kryptonite spear towards certain death was no less impactful. A brief word on Jesse Eisenberg's take on Lex Luthor. At least one other reviewer on this site already said it best when they pointed out that this was his origin story. If you consider his scheme objectively, he is actually one of the more formidable incarnations of the character. If we're lucky, we'll eventually get to see a Snyder Cut of \"Justice League\" and find out where this story was actually meant to go. For the record, Joss Whedon and Danny Elfman both should have said \"no\" to taking a dump on someone else's art."
"BATMAN V SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE brings a fantastic surprise to a smash-hit team-up with one of the worlds most beloved DC Comics' icons of all time. The movie delivers spectacular casting, and fantastic acting with different characters having their shine in each scenes.The story follows Clark Kent/Superman who becomes a threat, after the destruction in Metropolis in Man Of Steel.(2013). Batman/Bruce Wayne sees him as a threat and begins his war on Superman.The movie brings spectacular storytelling, it tells the complications of human against alien who are on the same side, and the first meeting of Batman and Superman. The story of Bruce Wayne, with his many years of The Caped Crusader, sends him on a spiral of \"out of control\", sheer anger, and builds tension to wanting to defeat the Man of Steel. Snyder has fantastically gave this storytelling an exciting nod to the comics.Lex Luthor, played by Jesse Einsberg, delivers a very interesting performance, but very differently by him showing is his \"origin\" before he becomes a bald foe to the Man of Steel. He shows that his love of \"god vs man\" terrorises mankind when he ultimately creates Doomsday, and Batman realises Superman's inner heroism.It packs so many great \"out of nowhere\" excitement, including a first-look of the fearful Wonder Woman a.k.a. Diana Prince, played by Gal Gadot, and a fresh-new glimpse of the superhero DC canon: The Justice League.WATCH THIS MOVIE! The critics are out of their mind. It's a fun-packed action adventure which still keeps the movie enjoyable until it's final minutes of the movie. It's a FANTASTIC MOVIE! BEN AFFLECK AS BATMAN... is Incredible!A 10/10 overall!"
"I want to go on record as saying that this is a truly thrilling cinematic experience in so many ways. If pressed, I guess I could acknowledge that there were a couple ... let's say \"clumsy\" moments. And in a film that runs to three hours, that hardly seems like a significant issue, certainly not enough to rate it with fewer than 9 stars.This film has everything. There is dramatic tension right from the start. There is a magnificent story arc that picks up quite seamlessly from 'Man of Steel' and propels the viewer not only into the life of Clark Kent/Superman but also of Bruce Wayne/Batman.The villain is no mere cartoon of a villain; he is truly thoroughly (and apparently irrevocably) diabolical. He is a psychopath, and you wish for his death over and over and over. You want Superman to reduce him to ash with the power of his eyes.I have read a number of viewers' reviews, and it seems that the people who disliked the film / gave it a low rating had rather unfair and unrealistic expectations of it. That is, their own prejudices about how the plot could/should unfold or what the character development could/should be, etc. ruined the film for them. And that is a shame.My thought is: I settle into my seat, wait for the lights to dim, and then I wait to be transported by the film. I accept it, lock, stock, and barrel.As another reviewer remarked, I love how the film begins from the point of view of Bruce Wayne as he is among people on the ground who have fallen victim to the attack of Zod and the other Kryptonians.Why would Bruce Wayne not like Superman? Why would the good people of Earth hurl insults at Superman and burn him in effigy (on the news)? Because the good people of Earth just got catapulted into a new reality in which there are not only extraterrestrial beings (surprise!) but they are also superman! And a group of them are hell-bent on destroying humankind and taking the planet for themselves.It is difficult to see Superman as separate from the whole Kryptonian Krew.It seems that many moviegoers forgot that Bruce Wayne is also human. Sure, he's a hero, but he is flawed.. Just like the rest of us. He is a vigilante, after all.He has let his vigilantism get the better of him. HE is actually the one working outside the boundaries of the law, not Superman. It is the clear head of Alfred that shows us that he has gone into a rather dark place, that he has not seen what is really going on (in Luthor's scheme), and so he chooses to embark on his own scheme scheme to take out the alien invader. He is (allegedly) thinking of the future: if he wipes out the all-powerful alien, then it can't turn on humankind in the future. At least, he convinces himself of that.A philosophical question is raised in the film: should Clark Kent have remained a simple man from Kansas and never have become the Superman? Should he just let people die and let calamities happen? The question is answered for us in the character of Diana Prince/Wonder Woman. She withdrew from mankind (her exact words) and just sat around watching. Watching while people died horrible deaths all around her. So, should Superman have done the same? Do these special beings, these 'metahumans', have some kind of moral imperative to intervene, or should they be allowed to be regular people, too? It seems that humans want it both ways.It seems that humans are saying: \"Don't be a superalien ... except when I and my friends and family are in trouble. Then come save us.\""

"Batman v Superman: Ultimate Edition: If your looking for a quick, cheap thrill then you might not enjoy this film at the time. This movies theatrical version was butchered by WB and in doing so reshaped the story leaving numerous plot holes. So the Ultimate Edition is the full story and the one worth seeing. Watch 'Man of Steel' before seeing this movie. There is much to claw through here, so much so that the audience might easily find themselves exhausted from the overall aggression of the film. However, a lot of the story does work. The action is good, and the emotion feels real most of the time.This film is about Superman trying to become Superman. Trying to help the world, save people, find a place in this world not as an outcast, and yet is looked at has a threat by many. Superman is not from this world, yet He is trying to be human, find a place in this world, be excepted by earths people, and come into his destiny.This film is also about Batman being Batman for 20 years and losing faith in humanity, and fearing Superman, what Superman can do with his powers. Great film, great plot, great visuals. ---Yidioo"
"I didn't see the film in the theaters and just bought the \"Extended Edition \" on Amazon. I never properly saw Man of Steel- i think I rented it and watched it when already exhausted and fell asleep. I saw the mediocre user reviews and horrible reviews from critics of this film.They really have it wrong. This is the very best either Batman or Superman. It has a different take, on things. Much darker then earlier films even darker then the Christopher Nolan Batman films.First of all Christopher Nolan is an Executive Producer. So how bad could it be? I loved Sucker Punch and Zack Snyder was involved with that. So how bad could this be? Hans Zimmer did the music, so how bad could it be?I remember watching the old Superman TV shows and reading the Superman and Batman comics as a little kid and loved them, but i wouldn't call myself a \"fan boy\" of comic universes, like so many younger people today. As an older adult I will admit my favorite TV show of all time was Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but watched it on DVD only after it had finished. I saw the second of the Dark Knight series in the theater, but the other two, I watched on DVD. They were great, but not my favorite films like so many people. i also loved the first couple Superman and Batman films in the older series. Regardless, i was not waiting with baited breath to see Man of Steel or this one.I'm more of a serious film fan, who can watch Stanley Kubrick films over and over and my favorite films in the last twenty years, are Eyes Wide Shut and Intersteller, both of which i've watched multiple times.So, with that said, take it from me, the critics have this film very wrong, just as critics hated 2001: A Space Odyssey when it first came out. This film will have lasting appreciation.Surprised how much I liked Ben Afleck's Batman. it was hard to get into Henry Cavil's scrawnier looking Superman, but it grew on me. Amy Adams was great as Lois Lane, The Gal Gadol Wonder Women was amazing. Lex Luther was terrific, like Nolan's Joker. Jeremy Irons was the best Alfred ever. Holly Hunter and Diane Lane was good too. The movie had bad reviews but made a billion dollars. Hopefully everyone buys the Ultimate Edition and it breaks sales records and the film is re-appreciated. I have no idea what scenes this Ultimate Edition added, but it is pretty perfect. Now I can't wait for Wonder Woman and the Justice League and as soon as I finish writing this am going to watch Man of Steal. I'm into it now!I can only surmise that the bad reviews stem from too much expectations of the rigid fan boy types and the radical changes in tone, we see in this film.Total masterpiece of cinema, but I have a few criticisms. There are a few hollow scenes of typical Idiot cops and authorities getting everything wrong in a cliché type way and it has a few filler scenes of that type and a few moments here and there that felt rushed and cheesy. Maybe not everything restored into the Ultimate Edition should have been. I wish there had been more Kevin Costner scenes."

"The whole entire Batman V Superman movie was great and yes even though it felt slow to the majority of the people who watched it but to me I enjoyed every part and every scene of Batman V Superman and when it got to the fight scenes both batman VS Superman and the Doomsday fight it brought so much drama, intensity, and epic performances. So with that being said I give this movie a good 10/10 because it really did go to my expectations and it brought a powerful performance and a powerful yet epic introduction to the upcoming Justice League."

"When I first wrote a review for this movie a year ago exclaiming my excitement for the film, I had been high off a fresh dose of live-action DC superheroes playing out the beloved comic book stories that I had grown up on. It was all playing out before my eyes and coming to life. After a few months had passed, I began to notice things about the movie that I disliked: little gaps in the story, things that didn't add up, etc. My original rating of a 10 / 10 dropped to an 8 /10. But today it has gone back up to a 10. The extended version of the film not only rectifies the gaps but also silences critics.Many claimed that the movie was too dark or that it just didn't make sense. To those people, I say: \"Pick up a comic book!\" Many of the critics of this particular film were part of the superhero bandwagon that formed when Marvel began its spree of Avengers-related films. In fact, its estimated that over 60% of people who go to see 'superhero' genre films have never picked up a comic book in their life. I would argue that similar numbers could figure to those which view the CW televised DC Universe shows. People complain that DC comics is just too dark but the fact is that these movies are based upon actual comics which are meant to be dark (ex: The Dark Knight Returns, Injustice, etc.). Its like complaining that Game of Thrones (the TV series) sucks because they kill off too many characters. Read the books! Its frustrating to see such a beautiful work of art like Batman V Superman criticized by those ignorant to its universe and its meaning. This movie is in fact a catalyst that opens numerous doorways and leaves true fans in awe of the possibilities for future movies. But regardless of whether or not people choose to educate themselves, this film's DVD/Blu-ray extended version puts the theater release to shame. All of the plot holes and gaps are filled in 30 minutes of extended footage scattered throughout the film. The movie ultimately becomes more complete and people will wish that the movie had shown the full 3 hours of footage in its theatrical debut. As a major DC comics fan, I will of course pick up on things that a comics fan would not, but someone who does not read comics would learn to appreciate this film in its entirety with the extended version. Get your hands on a copy today or find it on Netflix or the internet somewhere!"

"I ignored the bad reviews and watched anyways. This film had a lot to live up to after Civil War was released and I went into this film expecting the worst. It ended up to be the best Superhero film of 2016 to me. One complaint was that this film was more concerned about universe building than telling a great story than Civil War but for me it was the other way around; Civil War felt like a build up to something else and to be honest, I felt that way when I saw the other MCU films. Batman vs Superman however not only had a great story, but it also felt a lot more consistent than Civil War. This film was way more diverse with the cast than the MCU but unlike the MCU, I felt like this film doesn't go overboard with the SJW stuff like the MCU films or The Star Wars Sequel films do. The Visuals were AMAZING, The Score by Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL was AMAZING as well, The Tone is just right as I actually felt for the characters emotionally, The Cinematography kept my eyes glued to the screen, and the script felt really Intelligent and Complex and despite people calling the writing confusing, I was able to piece it together with no problem whatsoever. This film is similar to Empire Strikes back in terms of popularity so over time after the other movies are released, this movie would probably be more popular.This film was way better than I Expected and deserves another chance.

"Its shame to see what critics and marvel fans did to this movie and targeted Zack Snyder for it. I have seen this movie more than 25 times till date. And i enjoy this movie as much as i enjoyed the first time. The fans who have read DC comics, wouldn't be disappointed in this movie. Its dark movie, yes it is. Because the title shows the intense situation at hand. Two superheroes about to rip each other apart for whatever reasons that brought them to this stage. Yes it had to be dark and intense.Only marvel can be stupid enough to show an alien invasion where humans are loosing the battle and the super heroes are cracking jokes while battles as if they are playing ping pong. a person playing Call of Duty game is more serious while playing than the marvel heroes fighting aliens."

"Last week some news came out from somebody online who had claimed to have seen a finished version of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. If you were like me, you've been leery of checking it out because you weren't sure how much might actually be true. Now Zack Snyder has spoken out about the spoiler-filled post, although his response doesn't really clear anything up.In a word, to MTV, he called the post \"hilarious,which might imply that he's saying that it's mostly, if not entirely, untrue. That might be the case, but then again he could have just said it was untrue and he didn't say that. What he did say, however, is that he doesn't like spoilers. While this may seem odd for the director who's most recent trailer appeared to give away the entire movie, Snyder says that's not the case. Even if you've seen the trailer, you can rest easy, as there is much more we have not seen in then finished film. Says Snyder I have the benefit of seeing the movie. It's cool that think it's too much, and I appreciate people not wanting to know, but there's plenty that they don't know. There's a lot of movie that's not in the trailer. In the process of calling the Batman v Superman Reddit review hilarious, Snyder goes on to talk about how he hates it when spoilers come out. The director would much rather that fans see the movie mostly blind. While he understands that some fans may wish to find the answers before hand, he wants his movies to be mysteries going in. If you're, as an audience member, exploring these articles, looking for answers to questions that you have, maybe you're okay with knowing before you go. It's like an individual taste. But like I said, I want people to see the movie without knowing.Spoilers are a topic that mean different things to different people. While most try to avoid them to some degree, the need to solve the mystery is a nearly universal human experience. We have an inclination to want to know the truth, even while also wanting to be surprised. For most of us getting some information is good, but getting all the information is bad, of course, only getting the details that you want can be difficult."
"The theatrical is choppy, poorly edited, hard to follow, with some really good moments mixed in their. The extended is much more fluent and is much easier to follow, it does have a long runtime, which might make it seem a bit dragging on, but if you like long films done right, like Lord of the Rings, you will like this movie as long as you get into the characters and story. Speaking of which, the story starts out perfectly showing Bruce Wayne as a character, and it is very powerful. There are several moments in this movie that are powerful, emotional, and shocking. Characters. Batman is my favorite fictional character of all time, and believe me when I say, Ben Affleck as Batman was perfect, he had the charisma, the anger, and the look of being through some bad stuff Gal Gadot also does perfect as Wonder Woman, but if you want to really see how good she does, go watch the Wonder Woman movie. Henry Call as Superman. I really don't like it when people say Christopher Reeves is better. Don't get me wrong, Reeves does great, but can you imagine him as Superman in this movie? I wouldn't like it. It would be like Adam West playing Batman in The Dark Knight. Henry Cavill does great in this role, I can say everything about him as I said with Ben Affleck. Jesse Eisenberg as Luthor. I thought it was different in a good way. I've heard a criticism for him as being too much like Joker, but is that a bad thing? Joker is my favorite villain, so to see Superman have an enemy that crazy, but still hold the values Luthor needs to be Luthor, I think it is great. The thing I thought this movie was lacking in the first and second acts was humor, at least good humor. If there was more humor, I would've given this movie a ten because it would give a more relaxing feel to the parts that needed it. All in all though, this movie was awesome, it had powerful moments, it was badass, and just plain fun. It had a great story arc and does its job very well."

"*I will be talking about the Ultimate Edition of the film* This was one of the most anticipated CBM of all time. Ever since the arrival and subsequent success of Marvel's The Avengers people have wondered when will DC launch its own cinematic universe, one of the main reasons being the opportunity to finally see titans such as Batman and Superman share the screen together: the ultimate nerd dream. On 2016, the moment finally came for BvS to be released AND.. it performed poorly. Not only did critical reception left a lot to be desired, but fan reactions where surprisingly split after its cinematic debut. People either loved it and called Zack a genius, or hated it and called him a hack. Me, personally, I found myself with middle of the road feelings, for sure, but more leaning towards the negative side with subsequent viewings. The theatrical cut of the film showcased amazing performances, incredible visuals, and action set pieces that seemed like comic book panels come to life, in a good way. However, when it comes to its narrative structure and more technical aspects like editing, the film was seriously flawed. More plot holes than Age of Ultron, questionable character decisions, random editing that lacked cohesion and focus, and forced dramatic moments that lacked any impact because the attempts at character development ranged from limited to nonexistent, especially when it comes to Superman's character. I thought it was a 5/10 movie at best. As such, I was kind of skeptical about the idea of a 30 minute longer version. I say kind of because I know how Zack works. I remember Watchmen being vastly improved with its director's cut, so in a way I was expecting BvS to perform in a similar manner, but I also feared those 30 minutes wold be just there to amplify action and discredit storytelling issues. Oh boy, I'm so glad I was proved wrong. The ultimate cut of the film was infuriating, but not because it was awful, but because it questions the sanity of WB executives and editors and makes you wonder what were they thinking during the editing process. What I got out of the Ultimate Edition was a thought-provoking deconstruction of two very iconic superheroes that gave spotlight to the struggles both of them face when they aren't fighting crime. What I got was an extremely well produced character study on both Batman and Superman in a cynical world, a world dangerously close to our own. We meet Batman as a ruthless, worn out hero that has seen the failure behind his ideals and witnessed some truly horrifying things in his life. Superman, on the other hand, is portrayed as a godlike figure that seeks to do good in the world, but finds himself emotionally conflicted once he realized that every good deed he does leaves behind a trail of destruction (most of it due to Luthor's antics). In my opinion, this is a hugely original approach, one that distances itself from the rest of the competition and delivers a dark, somber, yet relevant superhero movie that understands both characters and gives them real human struggles to deal with. I felt invested in both of them, and hoped that by the end of the film both could find a way to redeem themselves. Their character arcs were very well established during the first two acts of the movie, and by the time we get to the titular climactic battle the emotion behind the jaw-dropping action is intensified. Lex Luthor as a villain was also given more time to develop with this new edition. One of the main criticisms with the original version was the fact that his plan relied too much on conveniences, and the character's mannerisms and mad-scientist attitude was annoying, and that goes without saying his motivations were unclear. Not only do we spend more time understanding his hate for any godlike figure and thus his hatred for Superman, but the added scenes allowed us to witness his entire plan come to fruition. It sells the cold, manipulative, calculating attributes of his comic counterpart. The acting is spot on. Every actor owns his/her role, from Cavill's Superman, to Ben Affleck as Batman, Eisenberg as Luthor, and Gadot as Wonder Woman, whose scenes are brief, but are more than enough to sell the strong and ferocious warrior that she is. Cinematography is stunning, and miles above that of Man of Steel's. And the soundtrack by Zimmer and Junkie XL? Perfect, just perfect. When it comes to flaws, the film still has some of those. The Martha moment, while serving as a pivotal character moment for Batman, felt off in execution, and its understandable that many people got mad at it. If your main complaint about BvS the first time around was its bleak tone and subject matter, this film is still not for you. I understand most were expecting to see the heroes being the most iconic versions of themselves, clashing in an elongated battle and evoking the same feelings The Avengers gave audiences back in 2012. In that sense, the film will remain divisive, but at least I have the comfort of saying that, at the very least, the film is competently made."

"This film was amazing. Ben Affleck was easily the best part of this movie, he brought his a-game as Batman. The chemistry between Affleck & Irons was outstanding. Gal Gadot did a great job as Wonder Woman. The fight between Batman & Superman was awesome. The final fight with Doomsday was outstanding in every way possible. However, there is only one problem with this film and that's Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor. He was sadly missed cast in this role, but then again it's really the fault of Warner Bros. Studios. Overall, this film deliver on almost every level. I highly recommend that you watch the extended version of this film."

"I know I know. I saw it in theaters too, and felt like it could've been so much better. While the Batman element was good, the narrative felt fractured, and the third act was just one long stunt scene. Superman was relegated to a supporting character, and other characters didn't get a chance to shine. And then I chanced on the ultimate cut. Calling it 30 mins of \"extra\" footage is unfair to Zack Snyder because it's exactly these 30 mins that makes the movie a worthy one. What I can say about the theatrical cut is this - It had the blockbuster elements - music, visuals, stunts, CGI. But, it lacked the human elements. The first 20 mins of the movie had it, but not after that. The extended cut in comparison has a flow to the narrative. There are no disjointed scenes, everything flows smoothly, and there's connective tissue. Superman gets to spend some time with his father, and mother. Clark Kent does some investigative journalism. Superman helps the people after the blast. Lois Lane doesn't jump to conclusions, she gets to the bottom of the crime. Lex Luthor apparently had a coherent plan - everything is explained pretty well. Wonder Woman was already good, so there's no change there :) Also, the \"Martha\" scene seems better executed, because it is a few seconds longer, and there's time to breathe it in. So, here's my take on this movie - The theatrical cut was junk. Get the Bluray for ultimate edition, and you shall not be disappointed. I've seen it so many more times now, and it's the definitive cut. It is the movie we deserve. It's a unique take on Batman, and Superman. It's a gritty take on the superhero movie genre, and definitely the best DCEU movie, and the best DC movie since The Dark Knight.P.S. Yes it's dark. We're adults, and we should appreciate mature film making without intentionally silly moments. It attempts to be philosophical, and something deep instead of just trying to make you chuckle."

"This is one of the best superhero movies ever made. Zack Snyder is a magician behind the camera.The reason behind so many complaints is the fact that Warner Bros. marketed this movie as a fight between Batman and Superman. That's not what it is. It's a movie about the origins of the Justice League.The cinematography, the acting and the score are all second to none. This film is phenomenal.P.S: watch the 3 hour extended cut that Snyder intended you to see, not the 2 and a half hour movie that Warner Bros. decided would be better for theaters."

"I don't care what the critics say, this is a very well-done movie. I'll start my review by listing what I like about the movie.1.) Ben Affleck is the best batman to me and it is not close. He pulls off the role of an aging batman extremely well. Also, Zack Snyder's vision of batman is legit. I have always hated batman up until this adaptation of him. Instead of being a conflicted and idealistic batman, this batman is dark, gritty, and 100% a badass. His equipment is decked out with machine guns and he has no aversion to killing people. In fact, he probably kills about 50 criminal by the time this movie is over. The warehouse scene is the coolest batman scene in any movie.2.) The development of a grudge between batman and superman is pulled off flawlessly. It actually makes sense why batman dislikes superman. Then, when they do fight it is about the coolest thing you can expect to see from a superhero film. 3.) I disagree with a lot of people about Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor. In my opinion, he played his role to perfection. 4.) B v S sets up Wonder Woman and Justice League with Gal Gadot's cameo as Wonder Woman and short clips of Aquaman, the Flash, and Cyborg. B v S is one of my favorite superhero films and rewatching it never gets old."

"The theatrical cut of this film is garbage which is why I rated it eight stars instead of nine. The first time I watched this film I didn't like it (not straight out hate but didn't like). Character motivations didn't make any sense, Lex was annoying as s***, editing was sloppy, and it was overly dark and broody for an action superhero movie. A year + a half, five Marvel films, a ton of bad reviews and a Justice League later a thought popped into my head: \"what if I watched BVS again\". This time I didn't have trailers ruining the best moments, I only vaguely remembered the film, and I was conditioned to look at it negatively but something unexpected happened: I actually loved it. Superman was just a normal person that tried to make a difference cause he could that others imposed their own beliefs on. Lex Luthor was a genius that couldn't stand his powerlessness compared to Superman or more accurately a super being. As Alfred said \"The fever, the rage, the feeling of powerlessness that turns good men... cruel\" and you see the same thought process in Batman. Batman, just like Lex Luthor feels powerless in the midst of a god-being and just like Lex he attempts to destroy him so he can get his sense of power back but unlike Lex, Batman learns something. I what is one of the corniest lines of the movie Superman says, \"Martha\" when he knows he can't win against Batman in a late desperate attempt to save his mother. Not only does this name connect with Bruce Wayne but it also shows what really matters to a man of steel: it isn't power, it isn't fame or anything else, it is his Mother and on a broader scale it is people. Lex (who doesn't care about people at all) knows he doesn't have the power so he creates something from his blood and the remains of Zod: A Doomsday for Superman. Not only does this film have depth but it also doesn't always explain it to you which is rare in a blockbuster action superhero flick normally cater to semi-comic book fans and people that want to shove popcorn in their mouths. This film rewards you for really noticing the details while still having massive explosions. One of my favorites is how Lex has all of Batman's branded killed which is why he isn't afraid of the branding at the end or Grandma's Peach Tea as a way of scaring the s*** out of someone. Of course, this film isn't perfect and I do have personal dislikes. The Batman V Superman fight was slow and pretty boring especially after watching such an amazing fight in Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 2 (If you haven't watched the animated Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 1 and 2 you are sorely missing out on something fantastic). Also, the addition of Wonder Woman who pretty much steals a hacker thing, gives it back and then suits up and fights against a giant monster thing. Not to say I don't like Wonder Woman (She is one of my favorite Superheroes of all time who showed not only can woman kick a** but they also don't need to be ashamed of their sexuality or gender) but she wasn't really that helpful to the plot and just brought in to expand the universe which was well done through Lex's superhuman hunting files. Also, the post-apocalyptic scene that was just a dream could have been cut but nothing is perfect except movies like Citizen Kane which isn't a lot of fun to watch cause it is too perfect. So to summarize, the theatrical cut is bad, the ultimate cut is Amazing and the other cut is meh. Please give it a second chance because it deserves it and save a good director from losing grace because of something he didn't do."
"I really liked it, don't know what all the hate is about. I'm actually a Marvel fan from when I was 7 or so, but Superman and Batman together in 1 movie? Just great. And personally I like Ben Affleck even better than Christian Bale as Batman. So just watch and enjoy, I know I did!"

"That's right. We have been waiting for these two heroes to finally meet and fight against each other. This movie is so good in both plot and special effects.Henry Cavill and Ben Affleck have performed well in their acting stages. They are the best superhero actors and they have filmed their fighting scenes very well. The movie starts to show the conflict between the lives of the heroes and now they have blamed each other for it. This movie is amazing and sets up a good plot for Dawn Justice."

"Actually...I didn't know what to expect. When you see Wonder Woman, you know it will be off of Wonder Woman and off of a Wonder Woman story, but with Batman V Superman, I was like, \"hmmmm, so who is this about?\" It was pretty obvious that it would feature many characters, but I thought the introduction to Batman was amazing. Ben Affleck nailed the part, not only as Batman but also as Bruce Wayne. He is my Batman. Henry Cavill continued to be super as the Man of Steel. And he is my Super - Man. A dark story? Yes, without a doubt. Could it have had a few more jokes? Sure. But not all movies or stories need to have jokes when certain events are serious. I really hope people can see this review and take another look at the movie, because, I loved it. I really hope the ratings can go up, eventually. And P.S, this movie is the perfect set up to Justice League."

"I'll start by making it clear I have only ever seen the Ultimate Edition. I'm aware of what was cut out for the theatrical release, so I will concede up front that most of the criticisms about pacing, editing, and missing bits of plot at release were merited.With that caveat out of the way, I must reiterate that this was bar-none the boldest superhero movie I have ever seen. To me, it was arguably the best as well, though \"best\" shouldn't be taken to mean \"most enjoyable.\" That honor easily goes to \"Thor: Ragnarok.\" What makes BvS stand out among other films in the genre is that it takes two characters who have been done to death since the 1970s and brings them up to date. I recently tried to watch \"Superman: The Movie\" for the first time in a number of years, and while it was still good and Reeves will always be iconic, I just couldn't take it seriously. I'll put it this way: If the story in BvS was \"stupid\" in your view but Superman turning back time by spinning the earth backward on its axis didn't seem like one of the dumbest things you have ever seen -in any movie from any genre- to the extent that it outright ruins the movie for you, then your opinion about BvS isn't worth much. Nostalgic bias was always going to be a problem for this movie, and the way people reacted to and reviewed \"Man of Steel\" was telling in this regard.That brings me to Zack Snyder's take on Superman. You know, that guy whose status as the first extraterrestrial ever encountered by humanity was a total non-issue in the old movies. Apparently, Snyder has a similar view to my own in that his take on the Man of Steel makes his being an alien a core piece of his identity. He may look like any other (absurdly attractive) person, but he knows what he is, and that makes him perpetually uncertain of where he fits in this world. He is essentially good and really does care about people, but he struggles to truly empathize with the likes of us. To be human is to be frail, and that is not something he can easily relate to. This is the root of his conflict with Batman.Just as Clark struggles to genuinely relate to most people, Snyder's Batman either refuses to or otherwise just can't relate to Superman. He doesn't see him as anything but a threat regardless of Superman's clear good intentions. Remember, a small group of Kryptonians were able to bring humanity to the brink of extinction in less than a day, and Bruce Wayne is nothing if not a realist. He didn't know the guy from Kansas. He only knew the god from another world.While Batman's anger toward and fear of Superman are readily apparent from the start, Superman's inability to imagine things from Bruce Wayne's perspective only becomes truly apparent during their first real interaction. This reminded me of the animated version of the \"world's finest\" storyline, where Superman judges Batman harshly for using fear tactics and threats of violence (also, actual violence) to get the job done. Superman wasn't willing to consider what it would take for a human man to fight criminals and save innocents, or what that life would do to him over time. Just as Batman didn't see the guy from Kansas, Superman didn't see the man who lives his life trapped in one brutal, unthinkably traumatic moment (this was beautifully conveyed during the film's opening moments), and had spent his whole adult life bearing witness to humanity at its absolute worst.The conflict between these two characters is as old as human history. They want the same things, but they can't understand one another. So they fight. And what a fight it was.Watching a fight between, say, Captain America and Iron Man was, to me, more frustrating than anything because each understood the other's perspective perfectly. The fight between Batman and Superman in BvS was genuinely gut-wrenching, as intended, because they would have understood one another if either had tried. The whole sequence hilighted Batman's tactical prowess and ability to control a situation. Maybe the most badass thing about the fight was that it ended exactly where Batman planned. That brings me to the big elephant in the room named \"Martha.\"I can't recall exactly which YouTuber put it this way, but if you thought the \"save Martha\" exchange was about their mothers having the same name, you had your brain turned off. The brain-on people have explained this to death, but it bears repeating. This was the moment when Superman became humanized to Batman. He was about to die, and his only concern was for his adoptive human mother. He still believed that the man about to take his life would do the right thing. Even with the cowl on, there was no mistaking the look on Batman's face. It was the look of shame, guilt, and sudden uncertainty that says \"What am I doing?\" Turns out even the most brutal, angry version of Bruce Wayne is better than Tony Stark at knowing right from wrong. At knowing that he had gone too far.From there, the third act was a series of truly impressive (albeit mostly CGI) fight sequences, beginning with what I regard as the undisputed champion of Batman fights. Nothing in the Nolan movies (and especially nothing in the Burton movies) even came close. Go ahead, try to convince yourself that Batman and Bane taking turns punching one another in the face until Bane's mask broke was a good fight sequence. No, this was a fight straight out of \"Arkham Knight,\" and it was glorious. The battle against Doomsday really was one for the books. From the moment Wonder Woman arrived accompanied by the intense sounds of Tina Guo's electric cello to Superman's tragic, heroic death at the hands of Doomsday, I was glued to the screen. Sure, the mere presence of Doomsday spoiled the end to a degree, but watching the Man of Steel laboring to carry that kryptonite spear towards certain death was no less impactful. A brief word on Jesse Eisenberg's take on Lex Luthor. At least one other reviewer on this site already said it best when they pointed out that this was his origin story. If you consider his scheme objectively, he is actually one of the more formidable incarnations of the character. If we're lucky, we'll eventually get to see a Snyder Cut of \"Justice League\" and find out where this story was actually meant to go. For the record, Joss Whedon and Danny Elfman both should have said \"no\" to taking a dump on someone else's art."
"BATMAN V SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE brings a fantastic surprise to a smash-hit team-up with one of the worlds most beloved DC Comics' icons of all time. The movie delivers spectacular casting, and fantastic acting with different characters having their shine in each scenes.The story follows Clark Kent/Superman who becomes a threat, after the destruction in Metropolis in Man Of Steel.(2013). Batman/Bruce Wayne sees him as a threat and begins his war on Superman.The movie brings spectacular storytelling, it tells the complications of human against alien who are on the same side, and the first meeting of Batman and Superman. The story of Bruce Wayne, with his many years of The Caped Crusader, sends him on a spiral of \"out of control\", sheer anger, and builds tension to wanting to defeat the Man of Steel. Snyder has fantastically gave this storytelling an exciting nod to the comics.Lex Luthor, played by Jesse Einsberg, delivers a very interesting performance, but very differently by him showing is his \"origin\" before he becomes a bald foe to the Man of Steel. He shows that his love of \"god vs man\" terrorises mankind when he ultimately creates Doomsday, and Batman realises Superman's inner heroism.It packs so many great \"out of nowhere\" excitement, including a first-look of the fearful Wonder Woman a.k.a. Diana Prince, played by Gal Gadot, and a fresh-new glimpse of the superhero DC canon: The Justice League.WATCH THIS MOVIE! The critics are out of their mind. It's a fun-packed action adventure which still keeps the movie enjoyable until it's final minutes of the movie. It's a FANTASTIC MOVIE! BEN AFFLECK AS BATMAN... is Incredible!A 10/10 overall!"
"I want to go on record as saying that this is a truly thrilling cinematic experience in so many ways. If pressed, I guess I could acknowledge that there were a couple ... let's say \"clumsy\" moments. And in a film that runs to three hours, that hardly seems like a significant issue, certainly not enough to rate it with fewer than 9 stars.This film has everything. There is dramatic tension right from the start. There is a magnificent story arc that picks up quite seamlessly from 'Man of Steel' and propels the viewer not only into the life of Clark Kent/Superman but also of Bruce Wayne/Batman.The villain is no mere cartoon of a villain; he is truly thoroughly (and apparently irrevocably) diabolical. He is a psychopath, and you wish for his death over and over and over. You want Superman to reduce him to ash with the power of his eyes.I have read a number of viewers' reviews, and it seems that the people who disliked the film / gave it a low rating had rather unfair and unrealistic expectations of it. That is, their own prejudices about how the plot could/should unfold or what the character development could/should be, etc. ruined the film for them. And that is a shame.My thought is: I settle into my seat, wait for the lights to dim, and then I wait to be transported by the film. I accept it, lock, stock, and barrel.As another reviewer remarked, I love how the film begins from the point of view of Bruce Wayne as he is among people on the ground who have fallen victim to the attack of Zod and the other Kryptonians.Why would Bruce Wayne not like Superman? Why would the good people of Earth hurl insults at Superman and burn him in effigy (on the news)? Because the good people of Earth just got catapulted into a new reality in which there are not only extraterrestrial beings (surprise!) but they are also superman! And a group of them are hell-bent on destroying humankind and taking the planet for themselves.It is difficult to see Superman as separate from the whole Kryptonian Krew.It seems that many moviegoers forgot that Bruce Wayne is also human. Sure, he's a hero, but he is flawed.. Just like the rest of us. He is a vigilante, after all.He has let his vigilantism get the better of him. HE is actually the one working outside the boundaries of the law, not Superman. It is the clear head of Alfred that shows us that he has gone into a rather dark place, that he has not seen what is really going on (in Luthor's scheme), and so he chooses to embark on his own scheme scheme to take out the alien invader. He is (allegedly) thinking of the future: if he wipes out the all-powerful alien, then it can't turn on humankind in the future. At least, he convinces himself of that.A philosophical question is raised in the film: should Clark Kent have remained a simple man from Kansas and never have become the Superman? Should he just let people die and let calamities happen? The question is answered for us in the character of Diana Prince/Wonder Woman. She withdrew from mankind (her exact words) and just sat around watching. Watching while people died horrible deaths all around her. So, should Superman have done the same? Do these special beings, these 'metahumans', have some kind of moral imperative to intervene, or should they be allowed to be regular people, too? It seems that humans want it both ways.It seems that humans are saying: \"Don't be a superalien ... except when I and my friends and family are in trouble. Then come save us.\""

"Batman v Superman: Ultimate Edition: If your looking for a quick, cheap thrill then you might not enjoy this film at the time. This movies theatrical version was butchered by WB and in doing so reshaped the story leaving numerous plot holes. So the Ultimate Edition is the full story and the one worth seeing. Watch 'Man of Steel' before seeing this movie. There is much to claw through here, so much so that the audience might easily find themselves exhausted from the overall aggression of the film. However, a lot of the story does work. The action is good, and the emotion feels real most of the time.This film is about Superman trying to become Superman. Trying to help the world, save people, find a place in this world not as an outcast, and yet is looked at has a threat by many. Superman is not from this world, yet He is trying to be human, find a place in this world, be excepted by earths people, and come into his destiny.This film is also about Batman being Batman for 20 years and losing faith in humanity, and fearing Superman, what Superman can do with his powers. Great film, great plot, great visuals. ---Yidioo"
"I didn't see the film in the theaters and just bought the \"Extended Edition \" on Amazon. I never properly saw Man of Steel- i think I rented it and watched it when already exhausted and fell asleep. I saw the mediocre user reviews and horrible reviews from critics of this film.They really have it wrong. This is the very best either Batman or Superman. It has a different take, on things. Much darker then earlier films even darker then the Christopher Nolan Batman films.First of all Christopher Nolan is an Executive Producer. So how bad could it be? I loved Sucker Punch and Zack Snyder was involved with that. So how bad could this be? Hans Zimmer did the music, so how bad could it be?I remember watching the old Superman TV shows and reading the Superman and Batman comics as a little kid and loved them, but i wouldn't call myself a \"fan boy\" of comic universes, like so many younger people today. As an older adult I will admit my favorite TV show of all time was Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but watched it on DVD only after it had finished. I saw the second of the Dark Knight series in the theater, but the other two, I watched on DVD. They were great, but not my favorite films like so many people. i also loved the first couple Superman and Batman films in the older series. Regardless, i was not waiting with baited breath to see Man of Steel or this one.I'm more of a serious film fan, who can watch Stanley Kubrick films over and over and my favorite films in the last twenty years, are Eyes Wide Shut and Intersteller, both of which i've watched multiple times.So, with that said, take it from me, the critics have this film very wrong, just as critics hated 2001: A Space Odyssey when it first came out. This film will have lasting appreciation.Surprised how much I liked Ben Afleck's Batman. it was hard to get into Henry Cavil's scrawnier looking Superman, but it grew on me. Amy Adams was great as Lois Lane, The Gal Gadol Wonder Women was amazing. Lex Luther was terrific, like Nolan's Joker. Jeremy Irons was the best Alfred ever. Holly Hunter and Diane Lane was good too. The movie had bad reviews but made a billion dollars. Hopefully everyone buys the Ultimate Edition and it breaks sales records and the film is re-appreciated. I have no idea what scenes this Ultimate Edition added, but it is pretty perfect. Now I can't wait for Wonder Woman and the Justice League and as soon as I finish writing this am going to watch Man of Steal. I'm into it now!I can only surmise that the bad reviews stem from too much expectations of the rigid fan boy types and the radical changes in tone, we see in this film.Total masterpiece of cinema, but I have a few criticisms. There are a few hollow scenes of typical Idiot cops and authorities getting everything wrong in a cliché type way and it has a few filler scenes of that type and a few moments here and there that felt rushed and cheesy. Maybe not everything restored into the Ultimate Edition should have been. I wish there had been more Kevin Costner scenes."

"The whole entire Batman V Superman movie was great and yes even though it felt slow to the majority of the people who watched it but to me I enjoyed every part and every scene of Batman V Superman and when it got to the fight scenes both batman VS Superman and the Doomsday fight it brought so much drama, intensity, and epic performances. So with that being said I give this movie a good 10/10 because it really did go to my expectations and it brought a powerful performance and a powerful yet epic introduction to the upcoming Justice League."

"When I first wrote a review for this movie a year ago exclaiming my excitement for the film, I had been high off a fresh dose of live-action DC superheroes playing out the beloved comic book stories that I had grown up on. It was all playing out before my eyes and coming to life. After a few months had passed, I began to notice things about the movie that I disliked: little gaps in the story, things that didn't add up, etc. My original rating of a 10 / 10 dropped to an 8 /10. But today it has gone back up to a 10. The extended version of the film not only rectifies the gaps but also silences critics.Many claimed that the movie was too dark or that it just didn't make sense. To those people, I say: \"Pick up a comic book!\" Many of the critics of this particular film were part of the superhero bandwagon that formed when Marvel began its spree of Avengers-related films. In fact, its estimated that over 60% of people who go to see 'superhero' genre films have never picked up a comic book in their life. I would argue that similar numbers could figure to those which view the CW televised DC Universe shows. People complain that DC comics is just too dark but the fact is that these movies are based upon actual comics which are meant to be dark (ex: The Dark Knight Returns, Injustice, etc.). Its like complaining that Game of Thrones (the TV series) sucks because they kill off too many characters. Read the books! Its frustrating to see such a beautiful work of art like Batman V Superman criticized by those ignorant to its universe and its meaning. This movie is in fact a catalyst that opens numerous doorways and leaves true fans in awe of the possibilities for future movies. But regardless of whether or not people choose to educate themselves, this film's DVD/Blu-ray extended version puts the theater release to shame. All of the plot holes and gaps are filled in 30 minutes of extended footage scattered throughout the film. The movie ultimately becomes more complete and people will wish that the movie had shown the full 3 hours of footage in its theatrical debut. As a major DC comics fan, I will of course pick up on things that a comics fan would not, but someone who does not read comics would learn to appreciate this film in its entirety with the extended version. Get your hands on a copy today or find it on Netflix or the internet somewhere!"

"I ignored the bad reviews and watched anyways. This film had a lot to live up to after Civil War was released and I went into this film expecting the worst. It ended up to be the best Superhero film of 2016 to me. One complaint was that this film was more concerned about universe building than telling a great story than Civil War but for me it was the other way around; Civil War felt like a build up to something else and to be honest, I felt that way when I saw the other MCU films. Batman vs Superman however not only had a great story, but it also felt a lot more consistent than Civil War. This film was way more diverse with the cast than the MCU but unlike the MCU, I felt like this film doesn't go overboard with the SJW stuff like the MCU films or The Star Wars Sequel films do. The Visuals were AMAZING, The Score by Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL was AMAZING as well, The Tone is just right as I actually felt for the characters emotionally, The Cinematography kept my eyes glued to the screen, and the script felt really Intelligent and Complex and despite people calling the writing confusing, I was able to piece it together with no problem whatsoever. This film is similar to Empire Strikes back in terms of popularity so over time after the other movies are released, this movie would probably be more popular.This film was way better than I Expected and deserves another chance.

"Its shame to see what critics and marvel fans did to this movie and targeted Zack Snyder for it. I have seen this movie more than 25 times till date. And i enjoy this movie as much as i enjoyed the first time. The fans who have read DC comics, wouldn't be disappointed in this movie. Its dark movie, yes it is. Because the title shows the intense situation at hand. Two superheroes about to rip each other apart for whatever reasons that brought them to this stage. Yes it had to be dark and intense.Only marvel can be stupid enough to show an alien invasion where humans are loosing the battle and the super heroes are cracking jokes while battles as if they are playing ping pong. a person playing Call of Duty game is more serious while playing than the marvel heroes fighting aliens."

"Last week some news came out from somebody online who had claimed to have seen a finished version of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. If you were like me, you've been leery of checking it out because you weren't sure how much might actually be true. Now Zack Snyder has spoken out about the spoiler-filled post, although his response doesn't really clear anything up.In a word, to MTV, he called the post \"hilarious,which might imply that he's saying that it's mostly, if not entirely, untrue. That might be the case, but then again he could have just said it was untrue and he didn't say that. What he did say, however, is that he doesn't like spoilers. While this may seem odd for the director who's most recent trailer appeared to give away the entire movie, Snyder says that's not the case. Even if you've seen the trailer, you can rest easy, as there is much more we have not seen in then finished film. Says Snyder I have the benefit of seeing the movie. It's cool that think it's too much, and I appreciate people not wanting to know, but there's plenty that they don't know. There's a lot of movie that's not in the trailer. In the process of calling the Batman v Superman Reddit review hilarious, Snyder goes on to talk about how he hates it when spoilers come out. The director would much rather that fans see the movie mostly blind. While he understands that some fans may wish to find the answers before hand, he wants his movies to be mysteries going in. If you're, as an audience member, exploring these articles, looking for answers to questions that you have, maybe you're okay with knowing before you go. It's like an individual taste. But like I said, I want people to see the movie without knowing.Spoilers are a topic that mean different things to different people. While most try to avoid them to some degree, the need to solve the mystery is a nearly universal human experience. We have an inclination to want to know the truth, even while also wanting to be surprised. For most of us getting some information is good, but getting all the information is bad, of course, only getting the details that you want can be difficult."
"The theatrical is choppy, poorly edited, hard to follow, with some really good moments mixed in their. The extended is much more fluent and is much easier to follow, it does have a long runtime, which might make it seem a bit dragging on, but if you like long films done right, like Lord of the Rings, you will like this movie as long as you get into the characters and story. Speaking of which, the story starts out perfectly showing Bruce Wayne as a character, and it is very powerful. There are several moments in this movie that are powerful, emotional, and shocking. Characters. Batman is my favorite fictional character of all time, and believe me when I say, Ben Affleck as Batman was perfect, he had the charisma, the anger, and the look of being through some bad stuff Gal Gadot also does perfect as Wonder Woman, but if you want to really see how good she does, go watch the Wonder Woman movie. Henry Call as Superman. I really don't like it when people say Christopher Reeves is better. Don't get me wrong, Reeves does great, but can you imagine him as Superman in this movie? I wouldn't like it. It would be like Adam West playing Batman in The Dark Knight. Henry Cavill does great in this role, I can say everything about him as I said with Ben Affleck. Jesse Eisenberg as Luthor. I thought it was different in a good way. I've heard a criticism for him as being too much like Joker, but is that a bad thing? Joker is my favorite villain, so to see Superman have an enemy that crazy, but still hold the values Luthor needs to be Luthor, I think it is great. The thing I thought this movie was lacking in the first and second acts was humor, at least good humor. If there was more humor, I would've given this movie a ten because it would give a more relaxing feel to the parts that needed it. All in all though, this movie was awesome, it had powerful moments, it was badass, and just plain fun. It had a great story arc and does its job very well."

"*I will be talking about the Ultimate Edition of the film* This was one of the most anticipated CBM of all time. Ever since the arrival and subsequent success of Marvel's The Avengers people have wondered when will DC launch its own cinematic universe, one of the main reasons being the opportunity to finally see titans such as Batman and Superman share the screen together: the ultimate nerd dream. On 2016, the moment finally came for BvS to be released AND.. it performed poorly. Not only did critical reception left a lot to be desired, but fan reactions where surprisingly split after its cinematic debut. People either loved it and called Zack a genius, or hated it and called him a hack. Me, personally, I found myself with middle of the road feelings, for sure, but more leaning towards the negative side with subsequent viewings. The theatrical cut of the film showcased amazing performances, incredible visuals, and action set pieces that seemed like comic book panels come to life, in a good way. However, when it comes to its narrative structure and more technical aspects like editing, the film was seriously flawed. More plot holes than Age of Ultron, questionable character decisions, random editing that lacked cohesion and focus, and forced dramatic moments that lacked any impact because the attempts at character development ranged from limited to nonexistent, especially when it comes to Superman's character. I thought it was a 5/10 movie at best. As such, I was kind of skeptical about the idea of a 30 minute longer version. I say kind of because I know how Zack works. I remember Watchmen being vastly improved with its director's cut, so in a way I was expecting BvS to perform in a similar manner, but I also feared those 30 minutes wold be just there to amplify action and discredit storytelling issues. Oh boy, I'm so glad I was proved wrong. The ultimate cut of the film was infuriating, but not because it was awful, but because it questions the sanity of WB executives and editors and makes you wonder what were they thinking during the editing process. What I got out of the Ultimate Edition was a thought-provoking deconstruction of two very iconic superheroes that gave spotlight to the struggles both of them face when they aren't fighting crime. What I got was an extremely well produced character study on both Batman and Superman in a cynical world, a world dangerously close to our own. We meet Batman as a ruthless, worn out hero that has seen the failure behind his ideals and witnessed some truly horrifying things in his life. Superman, on the other hand, is portrayed as a godlike figure that seeks to do good in the world, but finds himself emotionally conflicted once he realized that every good deed he does leaves behind a trail of destruction (most of it due to Luthor's antics). In my opinion, this is a hugely original approach, one that distances itself from the rest of the competition and delivers a dark, somber, yet relevant superhero movie that understands both characters and gives them real human struggles to deal with. I felt invested in both of them, and hoped that by the end of the film both could find a way to redeem themselves. Their character arcs were very well established during the first two acts of the movie, and by the time we get to the titular climactic battle the emotion behind the jaw-dropping action is intensified. Lex Luthor as a villain was also given more time to develop with this new edition. One of the main criticisms with the original version was the fact that his plan relied too much on conveniences, and the character's mannerisms and mad-scientist attitude was annoying, and that goes without saying his motivations were unclear. Not only do we spend more time understanding his hate for any godlike figure and thus his hatred for Superman, but the added scenes allowed us to witness his entire plan come to fruition. It sells the cold, manipulative, calculating attributes of his comic counterpart. The acting is spot on. Every actor owns his/her role, from Cavill's Superman, to Ben Affleck as Batman, Eisenberg as Luthor, and Gadot as Wonder Woman, whose scenes are brief, but are more than enough to sell the strong and ferocious warrior that she is. Cinematography is stunning, and miles above that of Man of Steel's. And the soundtrack by Zimmer and Junkie XL? Perfect, just perfect. When it comes to flaws, the film still has some of those. The Martha moment, while serving as a pivotal character moment for Batman, felt off in execution, and its understandable that many people got mad at it. If your main complaint about BvS the first time around was its bleak tone and subject matter, this film is still not for you. I understand most were expecting to see the heroes being the most iconic versions of themselves, clashing in an elongated battle and evoking the same feelings The Avengers gave audiences back in 2012. In that sense, the film will remain divisive, but at least I have the comfort of saying that, at the very least, the film is competently made."

"This film was amazing. Ben Affleck was easily the best part of this movie, he brought his a-game as Batman. The chemistry between Affleck & Irons was outstanding. Gal Gadot did a great job as Wonder Woman. The fight between Batman & Superman was awesome. The final fight with Doomsday was outstanding in every way possible. However, there is only one problem with this film and that's Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor. He was sadly missed cast in this role, but then again it's really the fault of Warner Bros. Studios. Overall, this film deliver on almost every level. I highly recommend that you watch the extended version of this film."

"I know I know. I saw it in theaters too, and felt like it could've been so much better. While the Batman element was good, the narrative felt fractured, and the third act was just one long stunt scene. Superman was relegated to a supporting character, and other characters didn't get a chance to shine. And then I chanced on the ultimate cut. Calling it 30 mins of \"extra\" footage is unfair to Zack Snyder because it's exactly these 30 mins that makes the movie a worthy one. What I can say about the theatrical cut is this - It had the blockbuster elements - music, visuals, stunts, CGI. But, it lacked the human elements. The first 20 mins of the movie had it, but not after that. The extended cut in comparison has a flow to the narrative. There are no disjointed scenes, everything flows smoothly, and there's connective tissue. Superman gets to spend some time with his father, and mother. Clark Kent does some investigative journalism. Superman helps the people after the blast. Lois Lane doesn't jump to conclusions, she gets to the bottom of the crime. Lex Luthor apparently had a coherent plan - everything is explained pretty well. Wonder Woman was already good, so there's no change there :) Also, the \"Martha\" scene seems better executed, because it is a few seconds longer, and there's time to breathe it in. So, here's my take on this movie - The theatrical cut was junk. Get the Bluray for ultimate edition, and you shall not be disappointed. I've seen it so many more times now, and it's the definitive cut. It is the movie we deserve. It's a unique take on Batman, and Superman. It's a gritty take on the superhero movie genre, and definitely the best DCEU movie, and the best DC movie since The Dark Knight.P.S. Yes it's dark. We're adults, and we should appreciate mature film making without intentionally silly moments. It attempts to be philosophical, and something deep instead of just trying to make you chuckle."

"This is one of the best superhero movies ever made. Zack Snyder is a magician behind the camera.The reason behind so many complaints is the fact that Warner Bros. marketed this movie as a fight between Batman and Superman. That's not what it is. It's a movie about the origins of the Justice League.The cinematography, the acting and the score are all second to none. This film is phenomenal.P.S: watch the 3 hour extended cut that Snyder intended you to see, not the 2 and a half hour movie that Warner Bros. decided would be better for theaters."

"I don't care what the critics say, this is a very well-done movie. I'll start my review by listing what I like about the movie.1.) Ben Affleck is the best batman to me and it is not close. He pulls off the role of an aging batman extremely well. Also, Zack Snyder's vision of batman is legit. I have always hated batman up until this adaptation of him. Instead of being a conflicted and idealistic batman, this batman is dark, gritty, and 100% a badass. His equipment is decked out with machine guns and he has no aversion to killing people. In fact, he probably kills about 50 criminal by the time this movie is over. The warehouse scene is the coolest batman scene in any movie.2.) The development of a grudge between batman and superman is pulled off flawlessly. It actually makes sense why batman dislikes superman. Then, when they do fight it is about the coolest thing you can expect to see from a superhero film. 3.) I disagree with a lot of people about Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor. In my opinion, he played his role to perfection. 4.) B v S sets up Wonder Woman and Justice League with Gal Gadot's cameo as Wonder Woman and short clips of Aquaman, the Flash, and Cyborg. B v S is one of my favorite superhero films and rewatching it never gets old."

"The theatrical cut of this film is garbage which is why I rated it eight stars instead of nine. The first time I watched this film I didn't like it (not straight out hate but didn't like). Character motivations didn't make any sense, Lex was annoying as s***, editing was sloppy, and it was overly dark and broody for an action superhero movie. A year + a half, five Marvel films, a ton of bad reviews and a Justice League later a thought popped into my head: \"what if I watched BVS again\". This time I didn't have trailers ruining the best moments, I only vaguely remembered the film, and I was conditioned to look at it negatively but something unexpected happened: I actually loved it. Superman was just a normal person that tried to make a difference cause he could that others imposed their own beliefs on. Lex Luthor was a genius that couldn't stand his powerlessness compared to Superman or more accurately a super being. As Alfred said \"The fever, the rage, the feeling of powerlessness that turns good men... cruel\" and you see the same thought process in Batman. Batman, just like Lex Luthor feels powerless in the midst of a god-being and just like Lex he attempts to destroy him so he can get his sense of power back but unlike Lex, Batman learns something. I what is one of the corniest lines of the movie Superman says, \"Martha\" when he knows he can't win against Batman in a late desperate attempt to save his mother. Not only does this name connect with Bruce Wayne but it also shows what really matters to a man of steel: it isn't power, it isn't fame or anything else, it is his Mother and on a broader scale it is people. Lex (who doesn't care about people at all) knows he doesn't have the power so he creates something from his blood and the remains of Zod: A Doomsday for Superman. Not only does this film have depth but it also doesn't always explain it to you which is rare in a blockbuster action superhero flick normally cater to semi-comic book fans and people that want to shove popcorn in their mouths. This film rewards you for really noticing the details while still having massive explosions. One of my favorites is how Lex has all of Batman's branded killed which is why he isn't afraid of the branding at the end or Grandma's Peach Tea as a way of scaring the s*** out of someone. Of course, this film isn't perfect and I do have personal dislikes. The Batman V Superman fight was slow and pretty boring especially after watching such an amazing fight in Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 2 (If you haven't watched the animated Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 1 and 2 you are sorely missing out on something fantastic). Also, the addition of Wonder Woman who pretty much steals a hacker thing, gives it back and then suits up and fights against a giant monster thing. Not to say I don't like Wonder Woman (She is one of my favorite Superheroes of all time who showed not only can woman kick a** but they also don't need to be ashamed of their sexuality or gender) but she wasn't really that helpful to the plot and just brought in to expand the universe which was well done through Lex's superhuman hunting files. Also, the post-apocalyptic scene that was just a dream could have been cut but nothing is perfect except movies like Citizen Kane which isn't a lot of fun to watch cause it is too perfect. So to summarize, the theatrical cut is bad, the ultimate cut is Amazing and the other cut is meh. Please give it a second chance because it deserves it and save a good director from losing grace because of something he didn't do."
"I really liked it, don't know what all the hate is about. I'm actually a Marvel fan from when I was 7 or so, but Superman and Batman together in 1 movie? Just great. And personally I like Ben Affleck even better than Christian Bale as Batman. So just watch and enjoy, I know I did!"

"That's right. We have been waiting for these two heroes to finally meet and fight against each other. This movie is so good in both plot and special effects.Henry Cavill and Ben Affleck have performed well in their acting stages. They are the best superhero actors and they have filmed their fighting scenes very well. The movie starts to show the conflict between the lives of the heroes and now they have blamed each other for it. This movie is amazing and sets up a good plot for Dawn Justice."

"Actually...I didn't know what to expect. When you see Wonder Woman, you know it will be off of Wonder Woman and off of a Wonder Woman story, but with Batman V Superman, I was like, \"hmmmm, so who is this about?\" It was pretty obvious that it would feature many characters, but I thought the introduction to Batman was amazing. Ben Affleck nailed the part, not only as Batman but also as Bruce Wayne. He is my Batman. Henry Cavill continued to be super as the Man of Steel. And he is my Super - Man. A dark story? Yes, without a doubt. Could it have had a few more jokes? Sure. But not all movies or stories need to have jokes when certain events are serious. I really hope people can see this review and take another look at the movie, because, I loved it. I really hope the ratings can go up, eventually. And P.S, this movie is the perfect set up to Justice League."

"I'll start by making it clear I have only ever seen the Ultimate Edition. I'm aware of what was cut out for the theatrical release, so I will concede up front that most of the criticisms about pacing, editing, and missing bits of plot at release were merited.With that caveat out of the way, I must reiterate that this was bar-none the boldest superhero movie I have ever seen. To me, it was arguably the best as well, though \"best\" shouldn't be taken to mean \"most enjoyable.\" That honor easily goes to \"Thor: Ragnarok.\" What makes BvS stand out among other films in the genre is that it takes two characters who have been done to death since the 1970s and brings them up to date. I recently tried to watch \"Superman: The Movie\" for the first time in a number of years, and while it was still good and Reeves will always be iconic, I just couldn't take it seriously. I'll put it this way: If the story in BvS was \"stupid\" in your view but Superman turning back time by spinning the earth backward on its axis didn't seem like one of the dumbest things you have ever seen -in any movie from any genre- to the extent that it outright ruins the movie for you, then your opinion about BvS isn't worth much. Nostalgic bias was always going to be a problem for this movie, and the way people reacted to and reviewed \"Man of Steel\" was telling in this regard.That brings me to Zack Snyder's take on Superman. You know, that guy whose status as the first extraterrestrial ever encountered by humanity was a total non-issue in the old movies. Apparently, Snyder has a similar view to my own in that his take on the Man of Steel makes his being an alien a core piece of his identity. He may look like any other (absurdly attractive) person, but he knows what he is, and that makes him perpetually uncertain of where he fits in this world. He is essentially good and really does care about people, but he struggles to truly empathize with the likes of us. To be human is to be frail, and that is not something he can easily relate to. This is the root of his conflict with Batman.Just as Clark struggles to genuinely relate to most people, Snyder's Batman either refuses to or otherwise just can't relate to Superman. He doesn't see him as anything but a threat regardless of Superman's clear good intentions. Remember, a small group of Kryptonians were able to bring humanity to the brink of extinction in less than a day, and Bruce Wayne is nothing if not a realist. He didn't know the guy from Kansas. He only knew the god from another world.While Batman's anger toward and fear of Superman are readily apparent from the start, Superman's inability to imagine things from Bruce Wayne's perspective only becomes truly apparent during their first real interaction. This reminded me of the animated version of the \"world's finest\" storyline, where Superman judges Batman harshly for using fear tactics and threats of violence (also, actual violence) to get the job done. Superman wasn't willing to consider what it would take for a human man to fight criminals and save innocents, or what that life would do to him over time. Just as Batman didn't see the guy from Kansas, Superman didn't see the man who lives his life trapped in one brutal, unthinkably traumatic moment (this was beautifully conveyed during the film's opening moments), and had spent his whole adult life bearing witness to humanity at its absolute worst.The conflict between these two characters is as old as human history. They want the same things, but they can't understand one another. So they fight. And what a fight it was.Watching a fight between, say, Captain America and Iron Man was, to me, more frustrating than anything because each understood the other's perspective perfectly. The fight between Batman and Superman in BvS was genuinely gut-wrenching, as intended, because they would have understood one another if either had tried. The whole sequence hilighted Batman's tactical prowess and ability to control a situation. Maybe the most badass thing about the fight was that it ended exactly where Batman planned. That brings me to the big elephant in the room named \"Martha.\"I can't recall exactly which YouTuber put it this way, but if you thought the \"save Martha\" exchange was about their mothers having the same name, you had your brain turned off. The brain-on people have explained this to death, but it bears repeating. This was the moment when Superman became humanized to Batman. He was about to die, and his only concern was for his adoptive human mother. He still believed that the man about to take his life would do the right thing. Even with the cowl on, there was no mistaking the look on Batman's face. It was the look of shame, guilt, and sudden uncertainty that says \"What am I doing?\" Turns out even the most brutal, angry version of Bruce Wayne is better than Tony Stark at knowing right from wrong. At knowing that he had gone too far.From there, the third act was a series of truly impressive (albeit mostly CGI) fight sequences, beginning with what I regard as the undisputed champion of Batman fights. Nothing in the Nolan movies (and especially nothing in the Burton movies) even came close. Go ahead, try to convince yourself that Batman and Bane taking turns punching one another in the face until Bane's mask broke was a good fight sequence. No, this was a fight straight out of \"Arkham Knight,\" and it was glorious. The battle against Doomsday really was one for the books. From the moment Wonder Woman arrived accompanied by the intense sounds of Tina Guo's electric cello to Superman's tragic, heroic death at the hands of Doomsday, I was glued to the screen. Sure, the mere presence of Doomsday spoiled the end to a degree, but watching the Man of Steel laboring to carry that kryptonite spear towards certain death was no less impactful. A brief word on Jesse Eisenberg's take on Lex Luthor. At least one other reviewer on this site already said it best when they pointed out that this was his origin story. If you consider his scheme objectively, he is actually one of the more formidable incarnations of the character. If we're lucky, we'll eventually get to see a Snyder Cut of \"Justice League\" and find out where this story was actually meant to go. For the record, Joss Whedon and Danny Elfman both should have said \"no\" to taking a dump on someone else's art."
"BATMAN V SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE brings a fantastic surprise to a smash-hit team-up with one of the worlds most beloved DC Comics' icons of all time. The movie delivers spectacular casting, and fantastic acting with different characters having their shine in each scenes.The story follows Clark Kent/Superman who becomes a threat, after the destruction in Metropolis in Man Of Steel.(2013). Batman/Bruce Wayne sees him as a threat and begins his war on Superman.The movie brings spectacular storytelling, it tells the complications of human against alien who are on the same side, and the first meeting of Batman and Superman. The story of Bruce Wayne, with his many years of The Caped Crusader, sends him on a spiral of \"out of control\", sheer anger, and builds tension to wanting to defeat the Man of Steel. Snyder has fantastically gave this storytelling an exciting nod to the comics.Lex Luthor, played by Jesse Einsberg, delivers a very interesting performance, but very differently by him showing is his \"origin\" before he becomes a bald foe to the Man of Steel. He shows that his love of \"god vs man\" terrorises mankind when he ultimately creates Doomsday, and Batman realises Superman's inner heroism.It packs so many great \"out of nowhere\" excitement, including a first-look of the fearful Wonder Woman a.k.a. Diana Prince, played by Gal Gadot, and a fresh-new glimpse of the superhero DC canon: The Justice League.WATCH THIS MOVIE! The critics are out of their mind. It's a fun-packed action adventure which still keeps the movie enjoyable until it's final minutes of the movie. It's a FANTASTIC MOVIE! BEN AFFLECK AS BATMAN... is Incredible!A 10/10 overall!"
"I want to go on record as saying that this is a truly thrilling cinematic experience in so many ways. If pressed, I guess I could acknowledge that there were a couple ... let's say \"clumsy\" moments. And in a film that runs to three hours, that hardly seems like a significant issue, certainly not enough to rate it with fewer than 9 stars.This film has everything. There is dramatic tension right from the start. There is a magnificent story arc that picks up quite seamlessly from 'Man of Steel' and propels the viewer not only into the life of Clark Kent/Superman but also of Bruce Wayne/Batman.The villain is no mere cartoon of a villain; he is truly thoroughly (and apparently irrevocably) diabolical. He is a psychopath, and you wish for his death over and over and over. You want Superman to reduce him to ash with the power of his eyes.I have read a number of viewers' reviews, and it seems that the people who disliked the film / gave it a low rating had rather unfair and unrealistic expectations of it. That is, their own prejudices about how the plot could/should unfold or what the character development could/should be, etc. ruined the film for them. And that is a shame.My thought is: I settle into my seat, wait for the lights to dim, and then I wait to be transported by the film. I accept it, lock, stock, and barrel.As another reviewer remarked, I love how the film begins from the point of view of Bruce Wayne as he is among people on the ground who have fallen victim to the attack of Zod and the other Kryptonians.Why would Bruce Wayne not like Superman? Why would the good people of Earth hurl insults at Superman and burn him in effigy (on the news)? Because the good people of Earth just got catapulted into a new reality in which there are not only extraterrestrial beings (surprise!) but they are also superman! And a group of them are hell-bent on destroying humankind and taking the planet for themselves.It is difficult to see Superman as separate from the whole Kryptonian Krew.It seems that many moviegoers forgot that Bruce Wayne is also human. Sure, he's a hero, but he is flawed.. Just like the rest of us. He is a vigilante, after all.He has let his vigilantism get the better of him. HE is actually the one working outside the boundaries of the law, not Superman. It is the clear head of Alfred that shows us that he has gone into a rather dark place, that he has not seen what is really going on (in Luthor's scheme), and so he chooses to embark on his own scheme scheme to take out the alien invader. He is (allegedly) thinking of the future: if he wipes out the all-powerful alien, then it can't turn on humankind in the future. At least, he convinces himself of that.A philosophical question is raised in the film: should Clark Kent have remained a simple man from Kansas and never have become the Superman? Should he just let people die and let calamities happen? The question is answered for us in the character of Diana Prince/Wonder Woman. She withdrew from mankind (her exact words) and just sat around watching. Watching while people died horrible deaths all around her. So, should Superman have done the same? Do these special beings, these 'metahumans', have some kind of moral imperative to intervene, or should they be allowed to be regular people, too? It seems that humans want it both ways.It seems that humans are saying: \"Don't be a superalien ... except when I and my friends and family are in trouble. Then come save us.\""

"Batman v Superman: Ultimate Edition: If your looking for a quick, cheap thrill then you might not enjoy this film at the time. This movies theatrical version was butchered by WB and in doing so reshaped the story leaving numerous plot holes. So the Ultimate Edition is the full story and the one worth seeing. Watch 'Man of Steel' before seeing this movie. There is much to claw through here, so much so that the audience might easily find themselves exhausted from the overall aggression of the film. However, a lot of the story does work. The action is good, and the emotion feels real most of the time.This film is about Superman trying to become Superman. Trying to help the world, save people, find a place in this world not as an outcast, and yet is looked at has a threat by many. Superman is not from this world, yet He is trying to be human, find a place in this world, be excepted by earths people, and come into his destiny.This film is also about Batman being Batman for 20 years and losing faith in humanity, and fearing Superman, what Superman can do with his powers. Great film, great plot, great visuals. ---Yidioo"
"I didn't see the film in the theaters and just bought the \"Extended Edition \" on Amazon. I never properly saw Man of Steel- i think I rented it and watched it when already exhausted and fell asleep. I saw the mediocre user reviews and horrible reviews from critics of this film.They really have it wrong. This is the very best either Batman or Superman. It has a different take, on things. Much darker then earlier films even darker then the Christopher Nolan Batman films.First of all Christopher Nolan is an Executive Producer. So how bad could it be? I loved Sucker Punch and Zack Snyder was involved with that. So how bad could this be? Hans Zimmer did the music, so how bad could it be?I remember watching the old Superman TV shows and reading the Superman and Batman comics as a little kid and loved them, but i wouldn't call myself a \"fan boy\" of comic universes, like so many younger people today. As an older adult I will admit my favorite TV show of all time was Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but watched it on DVD only after it had finished. I saw the second of the Dark Knight series in the theater, but the other two, I watched on DVD. They were great, but not my favorite films like so many people. i also loved the first couple Superman and Batman films in the older series. Regardless, i was not waiting with baited breath to see Man of Steel or this one.I'm more of a serious film fan, who can watch Stanley Kubrick films over and over and my favorite films in the last twenty years, are Eyes Wide Shut and Intersteller, both of which i've watched multiple times.So, with that said, take it from me, the critics have this film very wrong, just as critics hated 2001: A Space Odyssey when it first came out. This film will have lasting appreciation.Surprised how much I liked Ben Afleck's Batman. it was hard to get into Henry Cavil's scrawnier looking Superman, but it grew on me. Amy Adams was great as Lois Lane, The Gal Gadol Wonder Women was amazing. Lex Luther was terrific, like Nolan's Joker. Jeremy Irons was the best Alfred ever. Holly Hunter and Diane Lane was good too. The movie had bad reviews but made a billion dollars. Hopefully everyone buys the Ultimate Edition and it breaks sales records and the film is re-appreciated. I have no idea what scenes this Ultimate Edition added, but it is pretty perfect. Now I can't wait for Wonder Woman and the Justice League and as soon as I finish writing this am going to watch Man of Steal. I'm into it now!I can only surmise that the bad reviews stem from too much expectations of the rigid fan boy types and the radical changes in tone, we see in this film.Total masterpiece of cinema, but I have a few criticisms. There are a few hollow scenes of typical Idiot cops and authorities getting everything wrong in a cliché type way and it has a few filler scenes of that type and a few moments here and there that felt rushed and cheesy. Maybe not everything restored into the Ultimate Edition should have been. I wish there had been more Kevin Costner scenes."

"The whole entire Batman V Superman movie was great and yes even though it felt slow to the majority of the people who watched it but to me I enjoyed every part and every scene of Batman V Superman and when it got to the fight scenes both batman VS Superman and the Doomsday fight it brought so much drama, intensity, and epic performances. So with that being said I give this movie a good 10/10 because it really did go to my expectations and it brought a powerful performance and a powerful yet epic introduction to the upcoming Justice League."

"When I first wrote a review for this movie a year ago exclaiming my excitement for the film, I had been high off a fresh dose of live-action DC superheroes playing out the beloved comic book stories that I had grown up on. It was all playing out before my eyes and coming to life. After a few months had passed, I began to notice things about the movie that I disliked: little gaps in the story, things that didn't add up, etc. My original rating of a 10 / 10 dropped to an 8 /10. But today it has gone back up to a 10. The extended version of the film not only rectifies the gaps but also silences critics.Many claimed that the movie was too dark or that it just didn't make sense. To those people, I say: \"Pick up a comic book!\" Many of the critics of this particular film were part of the superhero bandwagon that formed when Marvel began its spree of Avengers-related films. In fact, its estimated that over 60% of people who go to see 'superhero' genre films have never picked up a comic book in their life. I would argue that similar numbers could figure to those which view the CW televised DC Universe shows. People complain that DC comics is just too dark but the fact is that these movies are based upon actual comics which are meant to be dark (ex: The Dark Knight Returns, Injustice, etc.). Its like complaining that Game of Thrones (the TV series) sucks because they kill off too many characters. Read the books! Its frustrating to see such a beautiful work of art like Batman V Superman criticized by those ignorant to its universe and its meaning. This movie is in fact a catalyst that opens numerous doorways and leaves true fans in awe of the possibilities for future movies. But regardless of whether or not people choose to educate themselves, this film's DVD/Blu-ray extended version puts the theater release to shame. All of the plot holes and gaps are filled in 30 minutes of extended footage scattered throughout the film. The movie ultimately becomes more complete and people will wish that the movie had shown the full 3 hours of footage in its theatrical debut. As a major DC comics fan, I will of course pick up on things that a comics fan would not, but someone who does not read comics would learn to appreciate this film in its entirety with the extended version. Get your hands on a copy today or find it on Netflix or the internet somewhere!"

"I ignored the bad reviews and watched anyways. This film had a lot to live up to after Civil War was released and I went into this film expecting the worst. It ended up to be the best Superhero film of 2016 to me. One complaint was that this film was more concerned about universe building than telling a great story than Civil War but for me it was the other way around; Civil War felt like a build up to something else and to be honest, I felt that way when I saw the other MCU films. Batman vs Superman however not only had a great story, but it also felt a lot more consistent than Civil War. This film was way more diverse with the cast than the MCU but unlike the MCU, I felt like this film doesn't go overboard with the SJW stuff like the MCU films or The Star Wars Sequel films do. The Visuals were AMAZING, The Score by Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL was AMAZING as well, The Tone is just right as I actually felt for the characters emotionally, The Cinematography kept my eyes glued to the screen, and the script felt really Intelligent and Complex and despite people calling the writing confusing, I was able to piece it together with no problem whatsoever. This film is similar to Empire Strikes back in terms of popularity so over time after the other movies are released, this movie would probably be more popular.This film was way better than I Expected and deserves another chance.

"Its shame to see what critics and marvel fans did to this movie and targeted Zack Snyder for it. I have seen this movie more than 25 times till date. And i enjoy this movie as much as i enjoyed the first time. The fans who have read DC comics, wouldn't be disappointed in this movie. Its dark movie, yes it is. Because the title shows the intense situation at hand. Two superheroes about to rip each other apart for whatever reasons that brought them to this stage. Yes it had to be dark and intense.Only marvel can be stupid enough to show an alien invasion where humans are loosing the battle and the super heroes are cracking jokes while battles as if they are playing ping pong. a person playing Call of Duty game is more serious while playing than the marvel heroes fighting aliens."

"Last week some news came out from somebody online who had claimed to have seen a finished version of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. If you were like me, you've been leery of checking it out because you weren't sure how much might actually be true. Now Zack Snyder has spoken out about the spoiler-filled post, although his response doesn't really clear anything up.In a word, to MTV, he called the post \"hilarious,which might imply that he's saying that it's mostly, if not entirely, untrue. That might be the case, but then again he could have just said it was untrue and he didn't say that. What he did say, however, is that he doesn't like spoilers. While this may seem odd for the director who's most recent trailer appeared to give away the entire movie, Snyder says that's not the case. Even if you've seen the trailer, you can rest easy, as there is much more we have not seen in then finished film. Says Snyder I have the benefit of seeing the movie. It's cool that think it's too much, and I appreciate people not wanting to know, but there's plenty that they don't know. There's a lot of movie that's not in the trailer. In the process of calling the Batman v Superman Reddit review hilarious, Snyder goes on to talk about how he hates it when spoilers come out. The director would much rather that fans see the movie mostly blind. While he understands that some fans may wish to find the answers before hand, he wants his movies to be mysteries going in. If you're, as an audience member, exploring these articles, looking for answers to questions that you have, maybe you're okay with knowing before you go. It's like an individual taste. But like I said, I want people to see the movie without knowing.Spoilers are a topic that mean different things to different people. While most try to avoid them to some degree, the need to solve the mystery is a nearly universal human experience. We have an inclination to want to know the truth, even while also wanting to be surprised. For most of us getting some information is good, but getting all the information is bad, of course, only getting the details that you want can be difficult."
"The theatrical is choppy, poorly edited, hard to follow, with some really good moments mixed in their. The extended is much more fluent and is much easier to follow, it does have a long runtime, which might make it seem a bit dragging on, but if you like long films done right, like Lord of the Rings, you will like this movie as long as you get into the characters and story. Speaking of which, the story starts out perfectly showing Bruce Wayne as a character, and it is very powerful. There are several moments in this movie that are powerful, emotional, and shocking. Characters. Batman is my favorite fictional character of all time, and believe me when I say, Ben Affleck as Batman was perfect, he had the charisma, the anger, and the look of being through some bad stuff Gal Gadot also does perfect as Wonder Woman, but if you want to really see how good she does, go watch the Wonder Woman movie. Henry Call as Superman. I really don't like it when people say Christopher Reeves is better. Don't get me wrong, Reeves does great, but can you imagine him as Superman in this movie? I wouldn't like it. It would be like Adam West playing Batman in The Dark Knight. Henry Cavill does great in this role, I can say everything about him as I said with Ben Affleck. Jesse Eisenberg as Luthor. I thought it was different in a good way. I've heard a criticism for him as being too much like Joker, but is that a bad thing? Joker is my favorite villain, so to see Superman have an enemy that crazy, but still hold the values Luthor needs to be Luthor, I think it is great. The thing I thought this movie was lacking in the first and second acts was humor, at least good humor. If there was more humor, I would've given this movie a ten because it would give a more relaxing feel to the parts that needed it. All in all though, this movie was awesome, it had powerful moments, it was badass, and just plain fun. It had a great story arc and does its job very well."

"*I will be talking about the Ultimate Edition of the film* This was one of the most anticipated CBM of all time. Ever since the arrival and subsequent success of Marvel's The Avengers people have wondered when will DC launch its own cinematic universe, one of the main reasons being the opportunity to finally see titans such as Batman and Superman share the screen together: the ultimate nerd dream. On 2016, the moment finally came for BvS to be released AND.. it performed poorly. Not only did critical reception left a lot to be desired, but fan reactions where surprisingly split after its cinematic debut. People either loved it and called Zack a genius, or hated it and called him a hack. Me, personally, I found myself with middle of the road feelings, for sure, but more leaning towards the negative side with subsequent viewings. The theatrical cut of the film showcased amazing performances, incredible visuals, and action set pieces that seemed like comic book panels come to life, in a good way. However, when it comes to its narrative structure and more technical aspects like editing, the film was seriously flawed. More plot holes than Age of Ultron, questionable character decisions, random editing that lacked cohesion and focus, and forced dramatic moments that lacked any impact because the attempts at character development ranged from limited to nonexistent, especially when it comes to Superman's character. I thought it was a 5/10 movie at best. As such, I was kind of skeptical about the idea of a 30 minute longer version. I say kind of because I know how Zack works. I remember Watchmen being vastly improved with its director's cut, so in a way I was expecting BvS to perform in a similar manner, but I also feared those 30 minutes wold be just there to amplify action and discredit storytelling issues. Oh boy, I'm so glad I was proved wrong. The ultimate cut of the film was infuriating, but not because it was awful, but because it questions the sanity of WB executives and editors and makes you wonder what were they thinking during the editing process. What I got out of the Ultimate Edition was a thought-provoking deconstruction of two very iconic superheroes that gave spotlight to the struggles both of them face when they aren't fighting crime. What I got was an extremely well produced character study on both Batman and Superman in a cynical world, a world dangerously close to our own. We meet Batman as a ruthless, worn out hero that has seen the failure behind his ideals and witnessed some truly horrifying things in his life. Superman, on the other hand, is portrayed as a godlike figure that seeks to do good in the world, but finds himself emotionally conflicted once he realized that every good deed he does leaves behind a trail of destruction (most of it due to Luthor's antics). In my opinion, this is a hugely original approach, one that distances itself from the rest of the competition and delivers a dark, somber, yet relevant superhero movie that understands both characters and gives them real human struggles to deal with. I felt invested in both of them, and hoped that by the end of the film both could find a way to redeem themselves. Their character arcs were very well established during the first two acts of the movie, and by the time we get to the titular climactic battle the emotion behind the jaw-dropping action is intensified. Lex Luthor as a villain was also given more time to develop with this new edition. One of the main criticisms with the original version was the fact that his plan relied too much on conveniences, and the character's mannerisms and mad-scientist attitude was annoying, and that goes without saying his motivations were unclear. Not only do we spend more time understanding his hate for any godlike figure and thus his hatred for Superman, but the added scenes allowed us to witness his entire plan come to fruition. It sells the cold, manipulative, calculating attributes of his comic counterpart. The acting is spot on. Every actor owns his/her role, from Cavill's Superman, to Ben Affleck as Batman, Eisenberg as Luthor, and Gadot as Wonder Woman, whose scenes are brief, but are more than enough to sell the strong and ferocious warrior that she is. Cinematography is stunning, and miles above that of Man of Steel's. And the soundtrack by Zimmer and Junkie XL? Perfect, just perfect. When it comes to flaws, the film still has some of those. The Martha moment, while serving as a pivotal character moment for Batman, felt off in execution, and its understandable that many people got mad at it. If your main complaint about BvS the first time around was its bleak tone and subject matter, this film is still not for you. I understand most were expecting to see the heroes being the most iconic versions of themselves, clashing in an elongated battle and evoking the same feelings The Avengers gave audiences back in 2012. In that sense, the film will remain divisive, but at least I have the comfort of saying that, at the very least, the film is competently made."

"This film was amazing. Ben Affleck was easily the best part of this movie, he brought his a-game as Batman. The chemistry between Affleck & Irons was outstanding. Gal Gadot did a great job as Wonder Woman. The fight between Batman & Superman was awesome. The final fight with Doomsday was outstanding in every way possible. However, there is only one problem with this film and that's Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor. He was sadly missed cast in this role, but then again it's really the fault of Warner Bros. Studios. Overall, this film deliver on almost every level. I highly recommend that you watch the extended version of this film."

"I know I know. I saw it in theaters too, and felt like it could've been so much better. While the Batman element was good, the narrative felt fractured, and the third act was just one long stunt scene. Superman was relegated to a supporting character, and other characters didn't get a chance to shine. And then I chanced on the ultimate cut. Calling it 30 mins of \"extra\" footage is unfair to Zack Snyder because it's exactly these 30 mins that makes the movie a worthy one. What I can say about the theatrical cut is this - It had the blockbuster elements - music, visuals, stunts, CGI. But, it lacked the human elements. The first 20 mins of the movie had it, but not after that. The extended cut in comparison has a flow to the narrative. There are no disjointed scenes, everything flows smoothly, and there's connective tissue. Superman gets to spend some time with his father, and mother. Clark Kent does some investigative journalism. Superman helps the people after the blast. Lois Lane doesn't jump to conclusions, she gets to the bottom of the crime. Lex Luthor apparently had a coherent plan - everything is explained pretty well. Wonder Woman was already good, so there's no change there :) Also, the \"Martha\" scene seems better executed, because it is a few seconds longer, and there's time to breathe it in. So, here's my take on this movie - The theatrical cut was junk. Get the Bluray for ultimate edition, and you shall not be disappointed. I've seen it so many more times now, and it's the definitive cut. It is the movie we deserve. It's a unique take on Batman, and Superman. It's a gritty take on the superhero movie genre, and definitely the best DCEU movie, and the best DC movie since The Dark Knight.P.S. Yes it's dark. We're adults, and we should appreciate mature film making without intentionally silly moments. It attempts to be philosophical, and something deep instead of just trying to make you chuckle."

"This is one of the best superhero movies ever made. Zack Snyder is a magician behind the camera.The reason behind so many complaints is the fact that Warner Bros. marketed this movie as a fight between Batman and Superman. That's not what it is. It's a movie about the origins of the Justice League.The cinematography, the acting and the score are all second to none. This film is phenomenal.P.S: watch the 3 hour extended cut that Snyder intended you to see, not the 2 and a half hour movie that Warner Bros. decided would be better for theaters."

"I don't care what the critics say, this is a very well-done movie. I'll start my review by listing what I like about the movie.1.) Ben Affleck is the best batman to me and it is not close. He pulls off the role of an aging batman extremely well. Also, Zack Snyder's vision of batman is legit. I have always hated batman up until this adaptation of him. Instead of being a conflicted and idealistic batman, this batman is dark, gritty, and 100% a badass. His equipment is decked out with machine guns and he has no aversion to killing people. In fact, he probably kills about 50 criminal by the time this movie is over. The warehouse scene is the coolest batman scene in any movie.2.) The development of a grudge between batman and superman is pulled off flawlessly. It actually makes sense why batman dislikes superman. Then, when they do fight it is about the coolest thing you can expect to see from a superhero film. 3.) I disagree with a lot of people about Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor. In my opinion, he played his role to perfection. 4.) B v S sets up Wonder Woman and Justice League with Gal Gadot's cameo as Wonder Woman and short clips of Aquaman, the Flash, and Cyborg. B v S is one of my favorite superhero films and rewatching it never gets old."

"The theatrical cut of this film is garbage which is why I rated it eight stars instead of nine. The first time I watched this film I didn't like it (not straight out hate but didn't like). Character motivations didn't make any sense, Lex was annoying as s***, editing was sloppy, and it was overly dark and broody for an action superhero movie. A year + a half, five Marvel films, a ton of bad reviews and a Justice League later a thought popped into my head: \"what if I watched BVS again\". This time I didn't have trailers ruining the best moments, I only vaguely remembered the film, and I was conditioned to look at it negatively but something unexpected happened: I actually loved it. Superman was just a normal person that tried to make a difference cause he could that others imposed their own beliefs on. Lex Luthor was a genius that couldn't stand his powerlessness compared to Superman or more accurately a super being. As Alfred said \"The fever, the rage, the feeling of powerlessness that turns good men... cruel\" and you see the same thought process in Batman. Batman, just like Lex Luthor feels powerless in the midst of a god-being and just like Lex he attempts to destroy him so he can get his sense of power back but unlike Lex, Batman learns something. I what is one of the corniest lines of the movie Superman says, \"Martha\" when he knows he can't win against Batman in a late desperate attempt to save his mother. Not only does this name connect with Bruce Wayne but it also shows what really matters to a man of steel: it isn't power, it isn't fame or anything else, it is his Mother and on a broader scale it is people. Lex (who doesn't care about people at all) knows he doesn't have the power so he creates something from his blood and the remains of Zod: A Doomsday for Superman. Not only does this film have depth but it also doesn't always explain it to you which is rare in a blockbuster action superhero flick normally cater to semi-comic book fans and people that want to shove popcorn in their mouths. This film rewards you for really noticing the details while still having massive explosions. One of my favorites is how Lex has all of Batman's branded killed which is why he isn't afraid of the branding at the end or Grandma's Peach Tea as a way of scaring the s*** out of someone. Of course, this film isn't perfect and I do have personal dislikes. The Batman V Superman fight was slow and pretty boring especially after watching such an amazing fight in Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 2 (If you haven't watched the animated Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 1 and 2 you are sorely missing out on something fantastic). Also, the addition of Wonder Woman who pretty much steals a hacker thing, gives it back and then suits up and fights against a giant monster thing. Not to say I don't like Wonder Woman (She is one of my favorite Superheroes of all time who showed not only can woman kick a** but they also don't need to be ashamed of their sexuality or gender) but she wasn't really that helpful to the plot and just brought in to expand the universe which was well done through Lex's superhuman hunting files. Also, the post-apocalyptic scene that was just a dream could have been cut but nothing is perfect except movies like Citizen Kane which isn't a lot of fun to watch cause it is too perfect. So to summarize, the theatrical cut is bad, the ultimate cut is Amazing and the other cut is meh. Please give it a second chance because it deserves it and save a good director from losing grace because of something he didn't do."
"I really liked it, don't know what all the hate is about. I'm actually a Marvel fan from when I was 7 or so, but Superman and Batman together in 1 movie? Just great. And personally I like Ben Affleck even better than Christian Bale as Batman. So just watch and enjoy, I know I did!"

"That's right. We have been waiting for these two heroes to finally meet and fight against each other. This movie is so good in both plot and special effects.Henry Cavill and Ben Affleck have performed well in their acting stages. They are the best superhero actors and they have filmed their fighting scenes very well. The movie starts to show the conflict between the lives of the heroes and now they have blamed each other for it. This movie is amazing and sets up a good plot for Dawn Justice."

"Actually...I didn't know what to expect. When you see Wonder Woman, you know it will be off of Wonder Woman and off of a Wonder Woman story, but with Batman V Superman, I was like, \"hmmmm, so who is this about?\" It was pretty obvious that it would feature many characters, but I thought the introduction to Batman was amazing. Ben Affleck nailed the part, not only as Batman but also as Bruce Wayne. He is my Batman. Henry Cavill continued to be super as the Man of Steel. And he is my Super - Man. A dark story? Yes, without a doubt. Could it have had a few more jokes? Sure. But not all movies or stories need to have jokes when certain events are serious. I really hope people can see this review and take another look at the movie, because, I loved it. I really hope the ratings can go up, eventually. And P.S, this movie is the perfect set up to Justice League."

"I'll start by making it clear I have only ever seen the Ultimate Edition. I'm aware of what was cut out for the theatrical release, so I will concede up front that most of the criticisms about pacing, editing, and missing bits of plot at release were merited.With that caveat out of the way, I must reiterate that this was bar-none the boldest superhero movie I have ever seen. To me, it was arguably the best as well, though \"best\" shouldn't be taken to mean \"most enjoyable.\" That honor easily goes to \"Thor: Ragnarok.\" What makes BvS stand out among other films in the genre is that it takes two characters who have been done to death since the 1970s and brings them up to date. I recently tried to watch \"Superman: The Movie\" for the first time in a number of years, and while it was still good and Reeves will always be iconic, I just couldn't take it seriously. I'll put it this way: If the story in BvS was \"stupid\" in your view but Superman turning back time by spinning the earth backward on its axis didn't seem like one of the dumbest things you have ever seen -in any movie from any genre- to the extent that it outright ruins the movie for you, then your opinion about BvS isn't worth much. Nostalgic bias was always going to be a problem for this movie, and the way people reacted to and reviewed \"Man of Steel\" was telling in this regard.That brings me to Zack Snyder's take on Superman. You know, that guy whose status as the first extraterrestrial ever encountered by humanity was a total non-issue in the old movies. Apparently, Snyder has a similar view to my own in that his take on the Man of Steel makes his being an alien a core piece of his identity. He may look like any other (absurdly attractive) person, but he knows what he is, and that makes him perpetually uncertain of where he fits in this world. He is essentially good and really does care about people, but he struggles to truly empathize with the likes of us. To be human is to be frail, and that is not something he can easily relate to. This is the root of his conflict with Batman.Just as Clark struggles to genuinely relate to most people, Snyder's Batman either refuses to or otherwise just can't relate to Superman. He doesn't see him as anything but a threat regardless of Superman's clear good intentions. Remember, a small group of Kryptonians were able to bring humanity to the brink of extinction in less than a day, and Bruce Wayne is nothing if not a realist. He didn't know the guy from Kansas. He only knew the god from another world.While Batman's anger toward and fear of Superman are readily apparent from the start, Superman's inability to imagine things from Bruce Wayne's perspective only becomes truly apparent during their first real interaction. This reminded me of the animated version of the \"world's finest\" storyline, where Superman judges Batman harshly for using fear tactics and threats of violence (also, actual violence) to get the job done. Superman wasn't willing to consider what it would take for a human man to fight criminals and save innocents, or what that life would do to him over time. Just as Batman didn't see the guy from Kansas, Superman didn't see the man who lives his life trapped in one brutal, unthinkably traumatic moment (this was beautifully conveyed during the film's opening moments), and had spent his whole adult life bearing witness to humanity at its absolute worst.The conflict between these two characters is as old as human history. They want the same things, but they can't understand one another. So they fight. And what a fight it was.Watching a fight between, say, Captain America and Iron Man was, to me, more frustrating than anything because each understood the other's perspective perfectly. The fight between Batman and Superman in BvS was genuinely gut-wrenching, as intended, because they would have understood one another if either had tried. The whole sequence hilighted Batman's tactical prowess and ability to control a situation. Maybe the most badass thing about the fight was that it ended exactly where Batman planned. That brings me to the big elephant in the room named \"Martha.\"I can't recall exactly which YouTuber put it this way, but if you thought the \"save Martha\" exchange was about their mothers having the same name, you had your brain turned off. The brain-on people have explained this to death, but it bears repeating. This was the moment when Superman became humanized to Batman. He was about to die, and his only concern was for his adoptive human mother. He still believed that the man about to take his life would do the right thing. Even with the cowl on, there was no mistaking the look on Batman's face. It was the look of shame, guilt, and sudden uncertainty that says \"What am I doing?\" Turns out even the most brutal, angry version of Bruce Wayne is better than Tony Stark at knowing right from wrong. At knowing that he had gone too far.From there, the third act was a series of truly impressive (albeit mostly CGI) fight sequences, beginning with what I regard as the undisputed champion of Batman fights. Nothing in the Nolan movies (and especially nothing in the Burton movies) even came close. Go ahead, try to convince yourself that Batman and Bane taking turns punching one another in the face until Bane's mask broke was a good fight sequence. No, this was a fight straight out of \"Arkham Knight,\" and it was glorious. The battle against Doomsday really was one for the books. From the moment Wonder Woman arrived accompanied by the intense sounds of Tina Guo's electric cello to Superman's tragic, heroic death at the hands of Doomsday, I was glued to the screen. Sure, the mere presence of Doomsday spoiled the end to a degree, but watching the Man of Steel laboring to carry that kryptonite spear towards certain death was no less impactful. A brief word on Jesse Eisenberg's take on Lex Luthor. At least one other reviewer on this site already said it best when they pointed out that this was his origin story. If you consider his scheme objectively, he is actually one of the more formidable incarnations of the character. If we're lucky, we'll eventually get to see a Snyder Cut of \"Justice League\" and find out where this story was actually meant to go. For the record, Joss Whedon and Danny Elfman both should have said \"no\" to taking a dump on someone else's art."
"BATMAN V SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE brings a fantastic surprise to a smash-hit team-up with one of the worlds most beloved DC Comics' icons of all time. The movie delivers spectacular casting, and fantastic acting with different characters having their shine in each scenes.The story follows Clark Kent/Superman who becomes a threat, after the destruction in Metropolis in Man Of Steel.(2013). Batman/Bruce Wayne sees him as a threat and begins his war on Superman.The movie brings spectacular storytelling, it tells the complications of human against alien who are on the same side, and the first meeting of Batman and Superman. The story of Bruce Wayne, with his many years of The Caped Crusader, sends him on a spiral of \"out of control\", sheer anger, and builds tension to wanting to defeat the Man of Steel. Snyder has fantastically gave this storytelling an exciting nod to the comics.Lex Luthor, played by Jesse Einsberg, delivers a very interesting performance, but very differently by him showing is his \"origin\" before he becomes a bald foe to the Man of Steel. He shows that his love of \"god vs man\" terrorises mankind when he ultimately creates Doomsday, and Batman realises Superman's inner heroism.It packs so many great \"out of nowhere\" excitement, including a first-look of the fearful Wonder Woman a.k.a. Diana Prince, played by Gal Gadot, and a fresh-new glimpse of the superhero DC canon: The Justice League.WATCH THIS MOVIE! The critics are out of their mind. It's a fun-packed action adventure which still keeps the movie enjoyable until it's final minutes of the movie. It's a FANTASTIC MOVIE! BEN AFFLECK AS BATMAN... is Incredible!A 10/10 overall!"
"I want to go on record as saying that this is a truly thrilling cinematic experience in so many ways. If pressed, I guess I could acknowledge that there were a couple ... let's say \"clumsy\" moments. And in a film that runs to three hours, that hardly seems like a significant issue, certainly not enough to rate it with fewer than 9 stars.This film has everything. There is dramatic tension right from the start. There is a magnificent story arc that picks up quite seamlessly from 'Man of Steel' and propels the viewer not only into the life of Clark Kent/Superman but also of Bruce Wayne/Batman.The villain is no mere cartoon of a villain; he is truly thoroughly (and apparently irrevocably) diabolical. He is a psychopath, and you wish for his death over and over and over. You want Superman to reduce him to ash with the power of his eyes.I have read a number of viewers' reviews, and it seems that the people who disliked the film / gave it a low rating had rather unfair and unrealistic expectations of it. That is, their own prejudices about how the plot could/should unfold or what the character development could/should be, etc. ruined the film for them. And that is a shame.My thought is: I settle into my seat, wait for the lights to dim, and then I wait to be transported by the film. I accept it, lock, stock, and barrel.As another reviewer remarked, I love how the film begins from the point of view of Bruce Wayne as he is among people on the ground who have fallen victim to the attack of Zod and the other Kryptonians.Why would Bruce Wayne not like Superman? Why would the good people of Earth hurl insults at Superman and burn him in effigy (on the news)? Because the good people of Earth just got catapulted into a new reality in which there are not only extraterrestrial beings (surprise!) but they are also superman! And a group of them are hell-bent on destroying humankind and taking the planet for themselves.It is difficult to see Superman as separate from the whole Kryptonian Krew.It seems that many moviegoers forgot that Bruce Wayne is also human. Sure, he's a hero, but he is flawed.. Just like the rest of us. He is a vigilante, after all.He has let his vigilantism get the better of him. HE is actually the one working outside the boundaries of the law, not Superman. It is the clear head of Alfred that shows us that he has gone into a rather dark place, that he has not seen what is really going on (in Luthor's scheme), and so he chooses to embark on his own scheme scheme to take out the alien invader. He is (allegedly) thinking of the future: if he wipes out the all-powerful alien, then it can't turn on humankind in the future. At least, he convinces himself of that.A philosophical question is raised in the film: should Clark Kent have remained a simple man from Kansas and never have become the Superman? Should he just let people die and let calamities happen? The question is answered for us in the character of Diana Prince/Wonder Woman. She withdrew from mankind (her exact words) and just sat around watching. Watching while people died horrible deaths all around her. So, should Superman have done the same? Do these special beings, these 'metahumans', have some kind of moral imperative to intervene, or should they be allowed to be regular people, too? It seems that humans want it both ways.It seems that humans are saying: \"Don't be a superalien ... except when I and my friends and family are in trouble. Then come save us.\""

"Batman v Superman: Ultimate Edition: If your looking for a quick, cheap thrill then you might not enjoy this film at the time. This movies theatrical version was butchered by WB and in doing so reshaped the story leaving numerous plot holes. So the Ultimate Edition is the full story and the one worth seeing. Watch 'Man of Steel' before seeing this movie. There is much to claw through here, so much so that the audience might easily find themselves exhausted from the overall aggression of the film. However, a lot of the story does work. The action is good, and the emotion feels real most of the time.This film is about Superman trying to become Superman. Trying to help the world, save people, find a place in this world not as an outcast, and yet is looked at has a threat by many. Superman is not from this world, yet He is trying to be human, find a place in this world, be excepted by earths people, and come into his destiny.This film is also about Batman being Batman for 20 years and losing faith in humanity, and fearing Superman, what Superman can do with his powers. Great film, great plot, great visuals. ---Yidioo"
"I didn't see the film in the theaters and just bought the \"Extended Edition \" on Amazon. I never properly saw Man of Steel- i think I rented it and watched it when already exhausted and fell asleep. I saw the mediocre user reviews and horrible reviews from critics of this film.They really have it wrong. This is the very best either Batman or Superman. It has a different take, on things. Much darker then earlier films even darker then the Christopher Nolan Batman films.First of all Christopher Nolan is an Executive Producer. So how bad could it be? I loved Sucker Punch and Zack Snyder was involved with that. So how bad could this be? Hans Zimmer did the music, so how bad could it be?I remember watching the old Superman TV shows and reading the Superman and Batman comics as a little kid and loved them, but i wouldn't call myself a \"fan boy\" of comic universes, like so many younger people today. As an older adult I will admit my favorite TV show of all time was Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but watched it on DVD only after it had finished. I saw the second of the Dark Knight series in the theater, but the other two, I watched on DVD. They were great, but not my favorite films like so many people. i also loved the first couple Superman and Batman films in the older series. Regardless, i was not waiting with baited breath to see Man of Steel or this one.I'm more of a serious film fan, who can watch Stanley Kubrick films over and over and my favorite films in the last twenty years, are Eyes Wide Shut and Intersteller, both of which i've watched multiple times.So, with that said, take it from me, the critics have this film very wrong, just as critics hated 2001: A Space Odyssey when it first came out. This film will have lasting appreciation.Surprised how much I liked Ben Afleck's Batman. it was hard to get into Henry Cavil's scrawnier looking Superman, but it grew on me. Amy Adams was great as Lois Lane, The Gal Gadol Wonder Women was amazing. Lex Luther was terrific, like Nolan's Joker. Jeremy Irons was the best Alfred ever. Holly Hunter and Diane Lane was good too. The movie had bad reviews but made a billion dollars. Hopefully everyone buys the Ultimate Edition and it breaks sales records and the film is re-appreciated. I have no idea what scenes this Ultimate Edition added, but it is pretty perfect. Now I can't wait for Wonder Woman and the Justice League and as soon as I finish writing this am going to watch Man of Steal. I'm into it now!I can only surmise that the bad reviews stem from too much expectations of the rigid fan boy types and the radical changes in tone, we see in this film.Total masterpiece of cinema, but I have a few criticisms. There are a few hollow scenes of typical Idiot cops and authorities getting everything wrong in a cliché type way and it has a few filler scenes of that type and a few moments here and there that felt rushed and cheesy. Maybe not everything restored into the Ultimate Edition should have been. I wish there had been more Kevin Costner scenes."

"The whole entire Batman V Superman movie was great and yes even though it felt slow to the majority of the people who watched it but to me I enjoyed every part and every scene of Batman V Superman and when it got to the fight scenes both batman VS Superman and the Doomsday fight it brought so much drama, intensity, and epic performances. So with that being said I give this movie a good 10/10 because it really did go to my expectations and it brought a powerful performance and a powerful yet epic introduction to the upcoming Justice League."

"When I first wrote a review for this movie a year ago exclaiming my excitement for the film, I had been high off a fresh dose of live-action DC superheroes playing out the beloved comic book stories that I had grown up on. It was all playing out before my eyes and coming to life. After a few months had passed, I began to notice things about the movie that I disliked: little gaps in the story, things that didn't add up, etc. My original rating of a 10 / 10 dropped to an 8 /10. But today it has gone back up to a 10. The extended version of the film not only rectifies the gaps but also silences critics.Many claimed that the movie was too dark or that it just didn't make sense. To those people, I say: \"Pick up a comic book!\" Many of the critics of this particular film were part of the superhero bandwagon that formed when Marvel began its spree of Avengers-related films. In fact, its estimated that over 60% of people who go to see 'superhero' genre films have never picked up a comic book in their life. I would argue that similar numbers could figure to those which view the CW televised DC Universe shows. People complain that DC comics is just too dark but the fact is that these movies are based upon actual comics which are meant to be dark (ex: The Dark Knight Returns, Injustice, etc.). Its like complaining that Game of Thrones (the TV series) sucks because they kill off too many characters. Read the books! Its frustrating to see such a beautiful work of art like Batman V Superman criticized by those ignorant to its universe and its meaning. This movie is in fact a catalyst that opens numerous doorways and leaves true fans in awe of the possibilities for future movies. But regardless of whether or not people choose to educate themselves, this film's DVD/Blu-ray extended version puts the theater release to shame. All of the plot holes and gaps are filled in 30 minutes of extended footage scattered throughout the film. The movie ultimately becomes more complete and people will wish that the movie had shown the full 3 hours of footage in its theatrical debut. As a major DC comics fan, I will of course pick up on things that a comics fan would not, but someone who does not read comics would learn to appreciate this film in its entirety with the extended version. Get your hands on a copy today or find it on Netflix or the internet somewhere!"

"I ignored the bad reviews and watched anyways. This film had a lot to live up to after Civil War was released and I went into this film expecting the worst. It ended up to be the best Superhero film of 2016 to me. One complaint was that this film was more concerned about universe building than telling a great story than Civil War but for me it was the other way around; Civil War felt like a build up to something else and to be honest, I felt that way when I saw the other MCU films. Batman vs Superman however not only had a great story, but it also felt a lot more consistent than Civil War. This film was way more diverse with the cast than the MCU but unlike the MCU, I felt like this film doesn't go overboard with the SJW stuff like the MCU films or The Star Wars Sequel films do. The Visuals were AMAZING, The Score by Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL was AMAZING as well, The Tone is just right as I actually felt for the characters emotionally, The Cinematography kept my eyes glued to the screen, and the script felt really Intelligent and Complex and despite people calling the writing confusing, I was able to piece it together with no problem whatsoever. This film is similar to Empire Strikes back in terms of popularity so over time after the other movies are released, this movie would probably be more popular.This film was way better than I Expected and deserves another chance.

"Its shame to see what critics and marvel fans did to this movie and targeted Zack Snyder for it. I have seen this movie more than 25 times till date. And i enjoy this movie as much as i enjoyed the first time. The fans who have read DC comics, wouldn't be disappointed in this movie. Its dark movie, yes it is. Because the title shows the intense situation at hand. Two superheroes about to rip each other apart for whatever reasons that brought them to this stage. Yes it had to be dark and intense.Only marvel can be stupid enough to show an alien invasion where humans are loosing the battle and the super heroes are cracking jokes while battles as if they are playing ping pong. a person playing Call of Duty game is more serious while playing than the marvel heroes fighting aliens."

"Last week some news came out from somebody online who had claimed to have seen a finished version of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. If you were like me, you've been leery of checking it out because you weren't sure how much might actually be true. Now Zack Snyder has spoken out about the spoiler-filled post, although his response doesn't really clear anything up.In a word, to MTV, he called the post \"hilarious,which might imply that he's saying that it's mostly, if not entirely, untrue. That might be the case, but then again he could have just said it was untrue and he didn't say that. What he did say, however, is that he doesn't like spoilers. While this may seem odd for the director who's most recent trailer appeared to give away the entire movie, Snyder says that's not the case. Even if you've seen the trailer, you can rest easy, as there is much more we have not seen in then finished film. Says Snyder I have the benefit of seeing the movie. It's cool that think it's too much, and I appreciate people not wanting to know, but there's plenty that they don't know. There's a lot of movie that's not in the trailer. In the process of calling the Batman v Superman Reddit review hilarious, Snyder goes on to talk about how he hates it when spoilers come out. The director would much rather that fans see the movie mostly blind. While he understands that some fans may wish to find the answers before hand, he wants his movies to be mysteries going in. If you're, as an audience member, exploring these articles, looking for answers to questions that you have, maybe you're okay with knowing before you go. It's like an individual taste. But like I said, I want people to see the movie without knowing.Spoilers are a topic that mean different things to different people. While most try to avoid them to some degree, the need to solve the mystery is a nearly universal human experience. We have an inclination to want to know the truth, even while also wanting to be surprised. For most of us getting some information is good, but getting all the information is bad, of course, only getting the details that you want can be difficult."
"The theatrical is choppy, poorly edited, hard to follow, with some really good moments mixed in their. The extended is much more fluent and is much easier to follow, it does have a long runtime, which might make it seem a bit dragging on, but if you like long films done right, like Lord of the Rings, you will like this movie as long as you get into the characters and story. Speaking of which, the story starts out perfectly showing Bruce Wayne as a character, and it is very powerful. There are several moments in this movie that are powerful, emotional, and shocking. Characters. Batman is my favorite fictional character of all time, and believe me when I say, Ben Affleck as Batman was perfect, he had the charisma, the anger, and the look of being through some bad stuff Gal Gadot also does perfect as Wonder Woman, but if you want to really see how good she does, go watch the Wonder Woman movie. Henry Call as Superman. I really don't like it when people say Christopher Reeves is better. Don't get me wrong, Reeves does great, but can you imagine him as Superman in this movie? I wouldn't like it. It would be like Adam West playing Batman in The Dark Knight. Henry Cavill does great in this role, I can say everything about him as I said with Ben Affleck. Jesse Eisenberg as Luthor. I thought it was different in a good way. I've heard a criticism for him as being too much like Joker, but is that a bad thing? Joker is my favorite villain, so to see Superman have an enemy that crazy, but still hold the values Luthor needs to be Luthor, I think it is great. The thing I thought this movie was lacking in the first and second acts was humor, at least good humor. If there was more humor, I would've given this movie a ten because it would give a more relaxing feel to the parts that needed it. All in all though, this movie was awesome, it had powerful moments, it was badass, and just plain fun. It had a great story arc and does its job very well."

"*I will be talking about the Ultimate Edition of the film* This was one of the most anticipated CBM of all time. Ever since the arrival and subsequent success of Marvel's The Avengers people have wondered when will DC launch its own cinematic universe, one of the main reasons being the opportunity to finally see titans such as Batman and Superman share the screen together: the ultimate nerd dream. On 2016, the moment finally came for BvS to be released AND.. it performed poorly. Not only did critical reception left a lot to be desired, but fan reactions where surprisingly split after its cinematic debut. People either loved it and called Zack a genius, or hated it and called him a hack. Me, personally, I found myself with middle of the road feelings, for sure, but more leaning towards the negative side with subsequent viewings. The theatrical cut of the film showcased amazing performances, incredible visuals, and action set pieces that seemed like comic book panels come to life, in a good way. However, when it comes to its narrative structure and more technical aspects like editing, the film was seriously flawed. More plot holes than Age of Ultron, questionable character decisions, random editing that lacked cohesion and focus, and forced dramatic moments that lacked any impact because the attempts at character development ranged from limited to nonexistent, especially when it comes to Superman's character. I thought it was a 5/10 movie at best. As such, I was kind of skeptical about the idea of a 30 minute longer version. I say kind of because I know how Zack works. I remember Watchmen being vastly improved with its director's cut, so in a way I was expecting BvS to perform in a similar manner, but I also feared those 30 minutes wold be just there to amplify action and discredit storytelling issues. Oh boy, I'm so glad I was proved wrong. The ultimate cut of the film was infuriating, but not because it was awful, but because it questions the sanity of WB executives and editors and makes you wonder what were they thinking during the editing process. What I got out of the Ultimate Edition was a thought-provoking deconstruction of two very iconic superheroes that gave spotlight to the struggles both of them face when they aren't fighting crime. What I got was an extremely well produced character study on both Batman and Superman in a cynical world, a world dangerously close to our own. We meet Batman as a ruthless, worn out hero that has seen the failure behind his ideals and witnessed some truly horrifying things in his life. Superman, on the other hand, is portrayed as a godlike figure that seeks to do good in the world, but finds himself emotionally conflicted once he realized that every good deed he does leaves behind a trail of destruction (most of it due to Luthor's antics). In my opinion, this is a hugely original approach, one that distances itself from the rest of the competition and delivers a dark, somber, yet relevant superhero movie that understands both characters and gives them real human struggles to deal with. I felt invested in both of them, and hoped that by the end of the film both could find a way to redeem themselves. Their character arcs were very well established during the first two acts of the movie, and by the time we get to the titular climactic battle the emotion behind the jaw-dropping action is intensified. Lex Luthor as a villain was also given more time to develop with this new edition. One of the main criticisms with the original version was the fact that his plan relied too much on conveniences, and the character's mannerisms and mad-scientist attitude was annoying, and that goes without saying his motivations were unclear. Not only do we spend more time understanding his hate for any godlike figure and thus his hatred for Superman, but the added scenes allowed us to witness his entire plan come to fruition. It sells the cold, manipulative, calculating attributes of his comic counterpart. The acting is spot on. Every actor owns his/her role, from Cavill's Superman, to Ben Affleck as Batman, Eisenberg as Luthor, and Gadot as Wonder Woman, whose scenes are brief, but are more than enough to sell the strong and ferocious warrior that she is. Cinematography is stunning, and miles above that of Man of Steel's. And the soundtrack by Zimmer and Junkie XL? Perfect, just perfect. When it comes to flaws, the film still has some of those. The Martha moment, while serving as a pivotal character moment for Batman, felt off in execution, and its understandable that many people got mad at it. If your main complaint about BvS the first time around was its bleak tone and subject matter, this film is still not for you. I understand most were expecting to see the heroes being the most iconic versions of themselves, clashing in an elongated battle and evoking the same feelings The Avengers gave audiences back in 2012. In that sense, the film will remain divisive, but at least I have the comfort of saying that, at the very least, the film is competently made."

"This film was amazing. Ben Affleck was easily the best part of this movie, he brought his a-game as Batman. The chemistry between Affleck & Irons was outstanding. Gal Gadot did a great job as Wonder Woman. The fight between Batman & Superman was awesome. The final fight with Doomsday was outstanding in every way possible. However, there is only one problem with this film and that's Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor. He was sadly missed cast in this role, but then again it's really the fault of Warner Bros. Studios. Overall, this film deliver on almost every level. I highly recommend that you watch the extended version of this film."

"I know I know. I saw it in theaters too, and felt like it could've been so much better. While the Batman element was good, the narrative felt fractured, and the third act was just one long stunt scene. Superman was relegated to a supporting character, and other characters didn't get a chance to shine. And then I chanced on the ultimate cut. Calling it 30 mins of \"extra\" footage is unfair to Zack Snyder because it's exactly these 30 mins that makes the movie a worthy one. What I can say about the theatrical cut is this - It had the blockbuster elements - music, visuals, stunts, CGI. But, it lacked the human elements. The first 20 mins of the movie had it, but not after that. The extended cut in comparison has a flow to the narrative. There are no disjointed scenes, everything flows smoothly, and there's connective tissue. Superman gets to spend some time with his father, and mother. Clark Kent does some investigative journalism. Superman helps the people after the blast. Lois Lane doesn't jump to conclusions, she gets to the bottom of the crime. Lex Luthor apparently had a coherent plan - everything is explained pretty well. Wonder Woman was already good, so there's no change there :) Also, the \"Martha\" scene seems better executed, because it is a few seconds longer, and there's time to breathe it in. So, here's my take on this movie - The theatrical cut was junk. Get the Bluray for ultimate edition, and you shall not be disappointed. I've seen it so many more times now, and it's the definitive cut. It is the movie we deserve. It's a unique take on Batman, and Superman. It's a gritty take on the superhero movie genre, and definitely the best DCEU movie, and the best DC movie since The Dark Knight.P.S. Yes it's dark. We're adults, and we should appreciate mature film making without intentionally silly moments. It attempts to be philosophical, and something deep instead of just trying to make you chuckle."

"This is one of the best superhero movies ever made. Zack Snyder is a magician behind the camera.The reason behind so many complaints is the fact that Warner Bros. marketed this movie as a fight between Batman and Superman. That's not what it is. It's a movie about the origins of the Justice League.The cinematography, the acting and the score are all second to none. This film is phenomenal.P.S: watch the 3 hour extended cut that Snyder intended you to see, not the 2 and a half hour movie that Warner Bros. decided would be better for theaters."

"I don't care what the critics say, this is a very well-done movie. I'll start my review by listing what I like about the movie.1.) Ben Affleck is the best batman to me and it is not close. He pulls off the role of an aging batman extremely well. Also, Zack Snyder's vision of batman is legit. I have always hated batman up until this adaptation of him. Instead of being a conflicted and idealistic batman, this batman is dark, gritty, and 100% a badass. His equipment is decked out with machine guns and he has no aversion to killing people. In fact, he probably kills about 50 criminal by the time this movie is over. The warehouse scene is the coolest batman scene in any movie.2.) The development of a grudge between batman and superman is pulled off flawlessly. It actually makes sense why batman dislikes superman. Then, when they do fight it is about the coolest thing you can expect to see from a superhero film. 3.) I disagree with a lot of people about Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor. In my opinion, he played his role to perfection. 4.) B v S sets up Wonder Woman and Justice League with Gal Gadot's cameo as Wonder Woman and short clips of Aquaman, the Flash, and Cyborg. B v S is one of my favorite superhero films and rewatching it never gets old."

"The theatrical cut of this film is garbage which is why I rated it eight stars instead of nine. The first time I watched this film I didn't like it (not straight out hate but didn't like). Character motivations didn't make any sense, Lex was annoying as s***, editing was sloppy, and it was overly dark and broody for an action superhero movie. A year + a half, five Marvel films, a ton of bad reviews and a Justice League later a thought popped into my head: \"what if I watched BVS again\". This time I didn't have trailers ruining the best moments, I only vaguely remembered the film, and I was conditioned to look at it negatively but something unexpected happened: I actually loved it. Superman was just a normal person that tried to make a difference cause he could that others imposed their own beliefs on. Lex Luthor was a genius that couldn't stand his powerlessness compared to Superman or more accurately a super being. As Alfred said \"The fever, the rage, the feeling of powerlessness that turns good men... cruel\" and you see the same thought process in Batman. Batman, just like Lex Luthor feels powerless in the midst of a god-being and just like Lex he attempts to destroy him so he can get his sense of power back but unlike Lex, Batman learns something. I what is one of the corniest lines of the movie Superman says, \"Martha\" when he knows he can't win against Batman in a late desperate attempt to save his mother. Not only does this name connect with Bruce Wayne but it also shows what really matters to a man of steel: it isn't power, it isn't fame or anything else, it is his Mother and on a broader scale it is people. Lex (who doesn't care about people at all) knows he doesn't have the power so he creates something from his blood and the remains of Zod: A Doomsday for Superman. Not only does this film have depth but it also doesn't always explain it to you which is rare in a blockbuster action superhero flick normally cater to semi-comic book fans and people that want to shove popcorn in their mouths. This film rewards you for really noticing the details while still having massive explosions. One of my favorites is how Lex has all of Batman's branded killed which is why he isn't afraid of the branding at the end or Grandma's Peach Tea as a way of scaring the s*** out of someone. Of course, this film isn't perfect and I do have personal dislikes. The Batman V Superman fight was slow and pretty boring especially after watching such an amazing fight in Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 2 (If you haven't watched the animated Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 1 and 2 you are sorely missing out on something fantastic). Also, the addition of Wonder Woman who pretty much steals a hacker thing, gives it back and then suits up and fights against a giant monster thing. Not to say I don't like Wonder Woman (She is one of my favorite Superheroes of all time who showed not only can woman kick a** but they also don't need to be ashamed of their sexuality or gender) but she wasn't really that helpful to the plot and just brought in to expand the universe which was well done through Lex's superhuman hunting files. Also, the post-apocalyptic scene that was just a dream could have been cut but nothing is perfect except movies like Citizen Kane which isn't a lot of fun to watch cause it is too perfect. So to summarize, the theatrical cut is bad, the ultimate cut is Amazing and the other cut is meh. Please give it a second chance because it deserves it and save a good director from losing grace because of something he didn't do."
"I really liked it, don't know what all the hate is about. I'm actually a Marvel fan from when I was 7 or so, but Superman and Batman together in 1 movie? Just great. And personally I like Ben Affleck even better than Christian Bale as Batman. So just watch and enjoy, I know I did!"

"That's right. We have been waiting for these two heroes to finally meet and fight against each other. This movie is so good in both plot and special effects.Henry Cavill and Ben Affleck have performed well in their acting stages. They are the best superhero actors and they have filmed their fighting scenes very well. The movie starts to show the conflict between the lives of the heroes and now they have blamed each other for it. This movie is amazing and sets up a good plot for Dawn Justice."

"Actually...I didn't know what to expect. When you see Wonder Woman, you know it will be off of Wonder Woman and off of a Wonder Woman story, but with Batman V Superman, I was like, \"hmmmm, so who is this about?\" It was pretty obvious that it would feature many characters, but I thought the introduction to Batman was amazing. Ben Affleck nailed the part, not only as Batman but also as Bruce Wayne. He is my Batman. Henry Cavill continued to be super as the Man of Steel. And he is my Super - Man. A dark story? Yes, without a doubt. Could it have had a few more jokes? Sure. But not all movies or stories need to have jokes when certain events are serious. I really hope people can see this review and take another look at the movie, because, I loved it. I really hope the ratings can go up, eventually. And P.S, this movie is the perfect set up to Justice League."

"I'll start by making it clear I have only ever seen the Ultimate Edition. I'm aware of what was cut out for the theatrical release, so I will concede up front that most of the criticisms about pacing, editing, and missing bits of plot at release were merited.With that caveat out of the way, I must reiterate that this was bar-none the boldest superhero movie I have ever seen. To me, it was arguably the best as well, though \"best\" shouldn't be taken to mean \"most enjoyable.\" That honor easily goes to \"Thor: Ragnarok.\" What makes BvS stand out among other films in the genre is that it takes two characters who have been done to death since the 1970s and brings them up to date. I recently tried to watch \"Superman: The Movie\" for the first time in a number of years, and while it was still good and Reeves will always be iconic, I just couldn't take it seriously. I'll put it this way: If the story in BvS was \"stupid\" in your view but Superman turning back time by spinning the earth backward on its axis didn't seem like one of the dumbest things you have ever seen -in any movie from any genre- to the extent that it outright ruins the movie for you, then your opinion about BvS isn't worth much. Nostalgic bias was always going to be a problem for this movie, and the way people reacted to and reviewed \"Man of Steel\" was telling in this regard.That brings me to Zack Snyder's take on Superman. You know, that guy whose status as the first extraterrestrial ever encountered by humanity was a total non-issue in the old movies. Apparently, Snyder has a similar view to my own in that his take on the Man of Steel makes his being an alien a core piece of his identity. He may look like any other (absurdly attractive) person, but he knows what he is, and that makes him perpetually uncertain of where he fits in this world. He is essentially good and really does care about people, but he struggles to truly empathize with the likes of us. To be human is to be frail, and that is not something he can easily relate to. This is the root of his conflict with Batman.Just as Clark struggles to genuinely relate to most people, Snyder's Batman either refuses to or otherwise just can't relate to Superman. He doesn't see him as anything but a threat regardless of Superman's clear good intentions. Remember, a small group of Kryptonians were able to bring humanity to the brink of extinction in less than a day, and Bruce Wayne is nothing if not a realist. He didn't know the guy from Kansas. He only knew the god from another world.While Batman's anger toward and fear of Superman are readily apparent from the start, Superman's inability to imagine things from Bruce Wayne's perspective only becomes truly apparent during their first real interaction. This reminded me of the animated version of the \"world's finest\" storyline, where Superman judges Batman harshly for using fear tactics and threats of violence (also, actual violence) to get the job done. Superman wasn't willing to consider what it would take for a human man to fight criminals and save innocents, or what that life would do to him over time. Just as Batman didn't see the guy from Kansas, Superman didn't see the man who lives his life trapped in one brutal, unthinkably traumatic moment (this was beautifully conveyed during the film's opening moments), and had spent his whole adult life bearing witness to humanity at its absolute worst.The conflict between these two characters is as old as human history. They want the same things, but they can't understand one another. So they fight. And what a fight it was.Watching a fight between, say, Captain America and Iron Man was, to me, more frustrating than anything because each understood the other's perspective perfectly. The fight between Batman and Superman in BvS was genuinely gut-wrenching, as intended, because they would have understood one another if either had tried. The whole sequence hilighted Batman's tactical prowess and ability to control a situation. Maybe the most badass thing about the fight was that it ended exactly where Batman planned. That brings me to the big elephant in the room named \"Martha.\"I can't recall exactly which YouTuber put it this way, but if you thought the \"save Martha\" exchange was about their mothers having the same name, you had your brain turned off. The brain-on people have explained this to death, but it bears repeating. This was the moment when Superman became humanized to Batman. He was about to die, and his only concern was for his adoptive human mother. He still believed that the man about to take his life would do the right thing. Even with the cowl on, there was no mistaking the look on Batman's face. It was the look of shame, guilt, and sudden uncertainty that says \"What am I doing?\" Turns out even the most brutal, angry version of Bruce Wayne is better than Tony Stark at knowing right from wrong. At knowing that he had gone too far.From there, the third act was a series of truly impressive (albeit mostly CGI) fight sequences, beginning with what I regard as the undisputed champion of Batman fights. Nothing in the Nolan movies (and especially nothing in the Burton movies) even came close. Go ahead, try to convince yourself that Batman and Bane taking turns punching one another in the face until Bane's mask broke was a good fight sequence. No, this was a fight straight out of \"Arkham Knight,\" and it was glorious. The battle against Doomsday really was one for the books. From the moment Wonder Woman arrived accompanied by the intense sounds of Tina Guo's electric cello to Superman's tragic, heroic death at the hands of Doomsday, I was glued to the screen. Sure, the mere presence of Doomsday spoiled the end to a degree, but watching the Man of Steel laboring to carry that kryptonite spear towards certain death was no less impactful. A brief word on Jesse Eisenberg's take on Lex Luthor. At least one other reviewer on this site already said it best when they pointed out that this was his origin story. If you consider his scheme objectively, he is actually one of the more formidable incarnations of the character. If we're lucky, we'll eventually get to see a Snyder Cut of \"Justice League\" and find out where this story was actually meant to go. For the record, Joss Whedon and Danny Elfman both should have said \"no\" to taking a dump on someone else's art."
"BATMAN V SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE brings a fantastic surprise to a smash-hit team-up with one of the worlds most beloved DC Comics' icons of all time. The movie delivers spectacular casting, and fantastic acting with different characters having their shine in each scenes.The story follows Clark Kent/Superman who becomes a threat, after the destruction in Metropolis in Man Of Steel.(2013). Batman/Bruce Wayne sees him as a threat and begins his war on Superman.The movie brings spectacular storytelling, it tells the complications of human against alien who are on the same side, and the first meeting of Batman and Superman. The story of Bruce Wayne, with his many years of The Caped Crusader, sends him on a spiral of \"out of control\", sheer anger, and builds tension to wanting to defeat the Man of Steel. Snyder has fantastically gave this storytelling an exciting nod to the comics.Lex Luthor, played by Jesse Einsberg, delivers a very interesting performance, but very differently by him showing is his \"origin\" before he becomes a bald foe to the Man of Steel. He shows that his love of \"god vs man\" terrorises mankind when he ultimately creates Doomsday, and Batman realises Superman's inner heroism.It packs so many great \"out of nowhere\" excitement, including a first-look of the fearful Wonder Woman a.k.a. Diana Prince, played by Gal Gadot, and a fresh-new glimpse of the superhero DC canon: The Justice League.WATCH THIS MOVIE! The critics are out of their mind. It's a fun-packed action adventure which still keeps the movie enjoyable until it's final minutes of the movie. It's a FANTASTIC MOVIE! BEN AFFLECK AS BATMAN... is Incredible!A 10/10 overall!"
"I want to go on record as saying that this is a truly thrilling cinematic experience in so many ways. If pressed, I guess I could acknowledge that there were a couple ... let's say \"clumsy\" moments. And in a film that runs to three hours, that hardly seems like a significant issue, certainly not enough to rate it with fewer than 9 stars.This film has everything. There is dramatic tension right from the start. There is a magnificent story arc that picks up quite seamlessly from 'Man of Steel' and propels the viewer not only into the life of Clark Kent/Superman but also of Bruce Wayne/Batman.The villain is no mere cartoon of a villain; he is truly thoroughly (and apparently irrevocably) diabolical. He is a psychopath, and you wish for his death over and over and over. You want Superman to reduce him to ash with the power of his eyes.I have read a number of viewers' reviews, and it seems that the people who disliked the film / gave it a low rating had rather unfair and unrealistic expectations of it. That is, their own prejudices about how the plot could/should unfold or what the character development could/should be, etc. ruined the film for them. And that is a shame.My thought is: I settle into my seat, wait for the lights to dim, and then I wait to be transported by the film. I accept it, lock, stock, and barrel.As another reviewer remarked, I love how the film begins from the point of view of Bruce Wayne as he is among people on the ground who have fallen victim to the attack of Zod and the other Kryptonians.Why would Bruce Wayne not like Superman? Why would the good people of Earth hurl insults at Superman and burn him in effigy (on the news)? Because the good people of Earth just got catapulted into a new reality in which there are not only extraterrestrial beings (surprise!) but they are also superman! And a group of them are hell-bent on destroying humankind and taking the planet for themselves.It is difficult to see Superman as separate from the whole Kryptonian Krew.It seems that many moviegoers forgot that Bruce Wayne is also human. Sure, he's a hero, but he is flawed.. Just like the rest of us. He is a vigilante, after all.He has let his vigilantism get the better of him. HE is actually the one working outside the boundaries of the law, not Superman. It is the clear head of Alfred that shows us that he has gone into a rather dark place, that he has not seen what is really going on (in Luthor's scheme), and so he chooses to embark on his own scheme scheme to take out the alien invader. He is (allegedly) thinking of the future: if he wipes out the all-powerful alien, then it can't turn on humankind in the future. At least, he convinces himself of that.A philosophical question is raised in the film: should Clark Kent have remained a simple man from Kansas and never have become the Superman? Should he just let people die and let calamities happen? The question is answered for us in the character of Diana Prince/Wonder Woman. She withdrew from mankind (her exact words) and just sat around watching. Watching while people died horrible deaths all around her. So, should Superman have done the same? Do these special beings, these 'metahumans', have some kind of moral imperative to intervene, or should they be allowed to be regular people, too? It seems that humans want it both ways.It seems that humans are saying: \"Don't be a superalien ... except when I and my friends and family are in trouble. Then come save us.\""

"Batman v Superman: Ultimate Edition: If your looking for a quick, cheap thrill then you might not enjoy this film at the time. This movies theatrical version was butchered by WB and in doing so reshaped the story leaving numerous plot holes. So the Ultimate Edition is the full story and the one worth seeing. Watch 'Man of Steel' before seeing this movie. There is much to claw through here, so much so that the audience might easily find themselves exhausted from the overall aggression of the film. However, a lot of the story does work. The action is good, and the emotion feels real most of the time.This film is about Superman trying to become Superman. Trying to help the world, save people, find a place in this world not as an outcast, and yet is looked at has a threat by many. Superman is not from this world, yet He is trying to be human, find a place in this world, be excepted by earths people, and come into his destiny.This film is also about Batman being Batman for 20 years and losing faith in humanity, and fearing Superman, what Superman can do with his powers. Great film, great plot, great visuals. ---Yidioo"
"I didn't see the film in the theaters and just bought the \"Extended Edition \" on Amazon. I never properly saw Man of Steel- i think I rented it and watched it when already exhausted and fell asleep. I saw the mediocre user reviews and horrible reviews from critics of this film.They really have it wrong. This is the very best either Batman or Superman. It has a different take, on things. Much darker then earlier films even darker then the Christopher Nolan Batman films.First of all Christopher Nolan is an Executive Producer. So how bad could it be? I loved Sucker Punch and Zack Snyder was involved with that. So how bad could this be? Hans Zimmer did the music, so how bad could it be?I remember watching the old Superman TV shows and reading the Superman and Batman comics as a little kid and loved them, but i wouldn't call myself a \"fan boy\" of comic universes, like so many younger people today. As an older adult I will admit my favorite TV show of all time was Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but watched it on DVD only after it had finished. I saw the second of the Dark Knight series in the theater, but the other two, I watched on DVD. They were great, but not my favorite films like so many people. i also loved the first couple Superman and Batman films in the older series. Regardless, i was not waiting with baited breath to see Man of Steel or this one.I'm more of a serious film fan, who can watch Stanley Kubrick films over and over and my favorite films in the last twenty years, are Eyes Wide Shut and Intersteller, both of which i've watched multiple times.So, with that said, take it from me, the critics have this film very wrong, just as critics hated 2001: A Space Odyssey when it first came out. This film will have lasting appreciation.Surprised how much I liked Ben Afleck's Batman. it was hard to get into Henry Cavil's scrawnier looking Superman, but it grew on me. Amy Adams was great as Lois Lane, The Gal Gadol Wonder Women was amazing. Lex Luther was terrific, like Nolan's Joker. Jeremy Irons was the best Alfred ever. Holly Hunter and Diane Lane was good too. The movie had bad reviews but made a billion dollars. Hopefully everyone buys the Ultimate Edition and it breaks sales records and the film is re-appreciated. I have no idea what scenes this Ultimate Edition added, but it is pretty perfect. Now I can't wait for Wonder Woman and the Justice League and as soon as I finish writing this am going to watch Man of Steal. I'm into it now!I can only surmise that the bad reviews stem from too much expectations of the rigid fan boy types and the radical changes in tone, we see in this film.Total masterpiece of cinema, but I have a few criticisms. There are a few hollow scenes of typical Idiot cops and authorities getting everything wrong in a cliché type way and it has a few filler scenes of that type and a few moments here and there that felt rushed and cheesy. Maybe not everything restored into the Ultimate Edition should have been. I wish there had been more Kevin Costner scenes."

"The whole entire Batman V Superman movie was great and yes even though it felt slow to the majority of the people who watched it but to me I enjoyed every part and every scene of Batman V Superman and when it got to the fight scenes both batman VS Superman and the Doomsday fight it brought so much drama, intensity, and epic performances. So with that being said I give this movie a good 10/10 because it really did go to my expectations and it brought a powerful performance and a powerful yet epic introduction to the upcoming Justice League."

"When I first wrote a review for this movie a year ago exclaiming my excitement for the film, I had been high off a fresh dose of live-action DC superheroes playing out the beloved comic book stories that I had grown up on. It was all playing out before my eyes and coming to life. After a few months had passed, I began to notice things about the movie that I disliked: little gaps in the story, things that didn't add up, etc. My original rating of a 10 / 10 dropped to an 8 /10. But today it has gone back up to a 10. The extended version of the film not only rectifies the gaps but also silences critics.Many claimed that the movie was too dark or that it just didn't make sense. To those people, I say: \"Pick up a comic book!\" Many of the critics of this particular film were part of the superhero bandwagon that formed when Marvel began its spree of Avengers-related films. In fact, its estimated that over 60% of people who go to see 'superhero' genre films have never picked up a comic book in their life. I would argue that similar numbers could figure to those which view the CW televised DC Universe shows. People complain that DC comics is just too dark but the fact is that these movies are based upon actual comics which are meant to be dark (ex: The Dark Knight Returns, Injustice, etc.). Its like complaining that Game of Thrones (the TV series) sucks because they kill off too many characters. Read the books! Its frustrating to see such a beautiful work of art like Batman V Superman criticized by those ignorant to its universe and its meaning. This movie is in fact a catalyst that opens numerous doorways and leaves true fans in awe of the possibilities for future movies. But regardless of whether or not people choose to educate themselves, this film's DVD/Blu-ray extended version puts the theater release to shame. All of the plot holes and gaps are filled in 30 minutes of extended footage scattered throughout the film. The movie ultimately becomes more complete and people will wish that the movie had shown the full 3 hours of footage in its theatrical debut. As a major DC comics fan, I will of course pick up on things that a comics fan would not, but someone who does not read comics would learn to appreciate this film in its entirety with the extended version. Get your hands on a copy today or find it on Netflix or the internet somewhere!"

"I ignored the bad reviews and watched anyways. This film had a lot to live up to after Civil War was released and I went into this film expecting the worst. It ended up to be the best Superhero film of 2016 to me. One complaint was that this film was more concerned about universe building than telling a great story than Civil War but for me it was the other way around; Civil War felt like a build up to something else and to be honest, I felt that way when I saw the other MCU films. Batman vs Superman however not only had a great story, but it also felt a lot more consistent than Civil War. This film was way more diverse with the cast than the MCU but unlike the MCU, I felt like this film doesn't go overboard with the SJW stuff like the MCU films or The Star Wars Sequel films do. The Visuals were AMAZING, The Score by Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL was AMAZING as well, The Tone is just right as I actually felt for the characters emotionally, The Cinematography kept my eyes glued to the screen, and the script felt really Intelligent and Complex and despite people calling the writing confusing, I was able to piece it together with no problem whatsoever. This film is similar to Empire Strikes back in terms of popularity so over time after the other movies are released, this movie would probably be more popular.This film was way better than I Expected and deserves another chance.

"Its shame to see what critics and marvel fans did to this movie and targeted Zack Snyder for it. I have seen this movie more than 25 times till date. And i enjoy this movie as much as i enjoyed the first time. The fans who have read DC comics, wouldn't be disappointed in this movie. Its dark movie, yes it is. Because the title shows the intense situation at hand. Two superheroes about to rip each other apart for whatever reasons that brought them to this stage. Yes it had to be dark and intense.Only marvel can be stupid enough to show an alien invasion where humans are loosing the battle and the super heroes are cracking jokes while battles as if they are playing ping pong. a person playing Call of Duty game is more serious while playing than the marvel heroes fighting aliens."

"Last week some news came out from somebody online who had claimed to have seen a finished version of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. If you were like me, you've been leery of checking it out because you weren't sure how much might actually be true. Now Zack Snyder has spoken out about the spoiler-filled post, although his response doesn't really clear anything up.In a word, to MTV, he called the post \"hilarious,which might imply that he's saying that it's mostly, if not entirely, untrue. That might be the case, but then again he could have just said it was untrue and he didn't say that. What he did say, however, is that he doesn't like spoilers. While this may seem odd for the director who's most recent trailer appeared to give away the entire movie, Snyder says that's not the case. Even if you've seen the trailer, you can rest easy, as there is much more we have not seen in then finished film. Says Snyder I have the benefit of seeing the movie. It's cool that think it's too much, and I appreciate people not wanting to know, but there's plenty that they don't know. There's a lot of movie that's not in the trailer. In the process of calling the Batman v Superman Reddit review hilarious, Snyder goes on to talk about how he hates it when spoilers come out. The director would much rather that fans see the movie mostly blind. While he understands that some fans may wish to find the answers before hand, he wants his movies to be mysteries going in. If you're, as an audience member, exploring these articles, looking for answers to questions that you have, maybe you're okay with knowing before you go. It's like an individual taste. But like I said, I want people to see the movie without knowing.Spoilers are a topic that mean different things to different people. While most try to avoid them to some degree, the need to solve the mystery is a nearly universal human experience. We have an inclination to want to know the truth, even while also wanting to be surprised. For most of us getting some information is good, but getting all the information is bad, of course, only getting the details that you want can be difficult."
"The theatrical is choppy, poorly edited, hard to follow, with some really good moments mixed in their. The extended is much more fluent and is much easier to follow, it does have a long runtime, which might make it seem a bit dragging on, but if you like long films done right, like Lord of the Rings, you will like this movie as long as you get into the characters and story. Speaking of which, the story starts out perfectly showing Bruce Wayne as a character, and it is very powerful. There are several moments in this movie that are powerful, emotional, and shocking. Characters. Batman is my favorite fictional character of all time, and believe me when I say, Ben Affleck as Batman was perfect, he had the charisma, the anger, and the look of being through some bad stuff Gal Gadot also does perfect as Wonder Woman, but if you want to really see how good she does, go watch the Wonder Woman movie. Henry Call as Superman. I really don't like it when people say Christopher Reeves is better. Don't get me wrong, Reeves does great, but can you imagine him as Superman in this movie? I wouldn't like it. It would be like Adam West playing Batman in The Dark Knight. Henry Cavill does great in this role, I can say everything about him as I said with Ben Affleck. Jesse Eisenberg as Luthor. I thought it was different in a good way. I've heard a criticism for him as being too much like Joker, but is that a bad thing? Joker is my favorite villain, so to see Superman have an enemy that crazy, but still hold the values Luthor needs to be Luthor, I think it is great. The thing I thought this movie was lacking in the first and second acts was humor, at least good humor. If there was more humor, I would've given this movie a ten because it would give a more relaxing feel to the parts that needed it. All in all though, this movie was awesome, it had powerful moments, it was badass, and just plain fun. It had a great story arc and does its job very well."

"*I will be talking about the Ultimate Edition of the film* This was one of the most anticipated CBM of all time. Ever since the arrival and subsequent success of Marvel's The Avengers people have wondered when will DC launch its own cinematic universe, one of the main reasons being the opportunity to finally see titans such as Batman and Superman share the screen together: the ultimate nerd dream. On 2016, the moment finally came for BvS to be released AND.. it performed poorly. Not only did critical reception left a lot to be desired, but fan reactions where surprisingly split after its cinematic debut. People either loved it and called Zack a genius, or hated it and called him a hack. Me, personally, I found myself with middle of the road feelings, for sure, but more leaning towards the negative side with subsequent viewings. The theatrical cut of the film showcased amazing performances, incredible visuals, and action set pieces that seemed like comic book panels come to life, in a good way. However, when it comes to its narrative structure and more technical aspects like editing, the film was seriously flawed. More plot holes than Age of Ultron, questionable character decisions, random editing that lacked cohesion and focus, and forced dramatic moments that lacked any impact because the attempts at character development ranged from limited to nonexistent, especially when it comes to Superman's character. I thought it was a 5/10 movie at best. As such, I was kind of skeptical about the idea of a 30 minute longer version. I say kind of because I know how Zack works. I remember Watchmen being vastly improved with its director's cut, so in a way I was expecting BvS to perform in a similar manner, but I also feared those 30 minutes wold be just there to amplify action and discredit storytelling issues. Oh boy, I'm so glad I was proved wrong. The ultimate cut of the film was infuriating, but not because it was awful, but because it questions the sanity of WB executives and editors and makes you wonder what were they thinking during the editing process. What I got out of the Ultimate Edition was a thought-provoking deconstruction of two very iconic superheroes that gave spotlight to the struggles both of them face when they aren't fighting crime. What I got was an extremely well produced character study on both Batman and Superman in a cynical world, a world dangerously close to our own. We meet Batman as a ruthless, worn out hero that has seen the failure behind his ideals and witnessed some truly horrifying things in his life. Superman, on the other hand, is portrayed as a godlike figure that seeks to do good in the world, but finds himself emotionally conflicted once he realized that every good deed he does leaves behind a trail of destruction (most of it due to Luthor's antics). In my opinion, this is a hugely original approach, one that distances itself from the rest of the competition and delivers a dark, somber, yet relevant superhero movie that understands both characters and gives them real human struggles to deal with. I felt invested in both of them, and hoped that by the end of the film both could find a way to redeem themselves. Their character arcs were very well established during the first two acts of the movie, and by the time we get to the titular climactic battle the emotion behind the jaw-dropping action is intensified. Lex Luthor as a villain was also given more time to develop with this new edition. One of the main criticisms with the original version was the fact that his plan relied too much on conveniences, and the character's mannerisms and mad-scientist attitude was annoying, and that goes without saying his motivations were unclear. Not only do we spend more time understanding his hate for any godlike figure and thus his hatred for Superman, but the added scenes allowed us to witness his entire plan come to fruition. It sells the cold, manipulative, calculating attributes of his comic counterpart. The acting is spot on. Every actor owns his/her role, from Cavill's Superman, to Ben Affleck as Batman, Eisenberg as Luthor, and Gadot as Wonder Woman, whose scenes are brief, but are more than enough to sell the strong and ferocious warrior that she is. Cinematography is stunning, and miles above that of Man of Steel's. And the soundtrack by Zimmer and Junkie XL? Perfect, just perfect. When it comes to flaws, the film still has some of those. The Martha moment, while serving as a pivotal character moment for Batman, felt off in execution, and its understandable that many people got mad at it. If your main complaint about BvS the first time around was its bleak tone and subject matter, this film is still not for you. I understand most were expecting to see the heroes being the most iconic versions of themselves, clashing in an elongated battle and evoking the same feelings The Avengers gave audiences back in 2012. In that sense, the film will remain divisive, but at least I have the comfort of saying that, at the very least, the film is competently made."

"This film was amazing. Ben Affleck was easily the best part of this movie, he brought his a-game as Batman. The chemistry between Affleck & Irons was outstanding. Gal Gadot did a great job as Wonder Woman. The fight between Batman & Superman was awesome. The final fight with Doomsday was outstanding in every way possible. However, there is only one problem with this film and that's Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor. He was sadly missed cast in this role, but then again it's really the fault of Warner Bros. Studios. Overall, this film deliver on almost every level. I highly recommend that you watch the extended version of this film."

"I know I know. I saw it in theaters too, and felt like it could've been so much better. While the Batman element was good, the narrative felt fractured, and the third act was just one long stunt scene. Superman was relegated to a supporting character, and other characters didn't get a chance to shine. And then I chanced on the ultimate cut. Calling it 30 mins of \"extra\" footage is unfair to Zack Snyder because it's exactly these 30 mins that makes the movie a worthy one. What I can say about the theatrical cut is this - It had the blockbuster elements - music, visuals, stunts, CGI. But, it lacked the human elements. The first 20 mins of the movie had it, but not after that. The extended cut in comparison has a flow to the narrative. There are no disjointed scenes, everything flows smoothly, and there's connective tissue. Superman gets to spend some time with his father, and mother. Clark Kent does some investigative journalism. Superman helps the people after the blast. Lois Lane doesn't jump to conclusions, she gets to the bottom of the crime. Lex Luthor apparently had a coherent plan - everything is explained pretty well. Wonder Woman was already good, so there's no change there :) Also, the \"Martha\" scene seems better executed, because it is a few seconds longer, and there's time to breathe it in. So, here's my take on this movie - The theatrical cut was junk. Get the Bluray for ultimate edition, and you shall not be disappointed. I've seen it so many more times now, and it's the definitive cut. It is the movie we deserve. It's a unique take on Batman, and Superman. It's a gritty take on the superhero movie genre, and definitely the best DCEU movie, and the best DC movie since The Dark Knight.P.S. Yes it's dark. We're adults, and we should appreciate mature film making without intentionally silly moments. It attempts to be philosophical, and something deep instead of just trying to make you chuckle."

"This is one of the best superhero movies ever made. Zack Snyder is a magician behind the camera.The reason behind so many complaints is the fact that Warner Bros. marketed this movie as a fight between Batman and Superman. That's not what it is. It's a movie about the origins of the Justice League.The cinematography, the acting and the score are all second to none. This film is phenomenal.P.S: watch the 3 hour extended cut that Snyder intended you to see, not the 2 and a half hour movie that Warner Bros. decided would be better for theaters."

"I don't care what the critics say, this is a very well-done movie. I'll start my review by listing what I like about the movie.1.) Ben Affleck is the best batman to me and it is not close. He pulls off the role of an aging batman extremely well. Also, Zack Snyder's vision of batman is legit. I have always hated batman up until this adaptation of him. Instead of being a conflicted and idealistic batman, this batman is dark, gritty, and 100% a badass. His equipment is decked out with machine guns and he has no aversion to killing people. In fact, he probably kills about 50 criminal by the time this movie is over. The warehouse scene is the coolest batman scene in any movie.2.) The development of a grudge between batman and superman is pulled off flawlessly. It actually makes sense why batman dislikes superman. Then, when they do fight it is about the coolest thing you can expect to see from a superhero film. 3.) I disagree with a lot of people about Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor. In my opinion, he played his role to perfection. 4.) B v S sets up Wonder Woman and Justice League with Gal Gadot's cameo as Wonder Woman and short clips of Aquaman, the Flash, and Cyborg. B v S is one of my favorite superhero films and rewatching it never gets old."

"The theatrical cut of this film is garbage which is why I rated it eight stars instead of nine. The first time I watched this film I didn't like it (not straight out hate but didn't like). Character motivations didn't make any sense, Lex was annoying as s***, editing was sloppy, and it was overly dark and broody for an action superhero movie. A year + a half, five Marvel films, a ton of bad reviews and a Justice League later a thought popped into my head: \"what if I watched BVS again\". This time I didn't have trailers ruining the best moments, I only vaguely remembered the film, and I was conditioned to look at it negatively but something unexpected happened: I actually loved it. Superman was just a normal person that tried to make a difference cause he could that others imposed their own beliefs on. Lex Luthor was a genius that couldn't stand his powerlessness compared to Superman or more accurately a super being. As Alfred said \"The fever, the rage, the feeling of powerlessness that turns good men... cruel\" and you see the same thought process in Batman. Batman, just like Lex Luthor feels powerless in the midst of a god-being and just like Lex he attempts to destroy him so he can get his sense of power back but unlike Lex, Batman learns something. I what is one of the corniest lines of the movie Superman says, \"Martha\" when he knows he can't win against Batman in a late desperate attempt to save his mother. Not only does this name connect with Bruce Wayne but it also shows what really matters to a man of steel: it isn't power, it isn't fame or anything else, it is his Mother and on a broader scale it is people. Lex (who doesn't care about people at all) knows he doesn't have the power so he creates something from his blood and the remains of Zod: A Doomsday for Superman. Not only does this film have depth but it also doesn't always explain it to you which is rare in a blockbuster action superhero flick normally cater to semi-comic book fans and people that want to shove popcorn in their mouths. This film rewards you for really noticing the details while still having massive explosions. One of my favorites is how Lex has all of Batman's branded killed which is why he isn't afraid of the branding at the end or Grandma's Peach Tea as a way of scaring the s*** out of someone. Of course, this film isn't perfect and I do have personal dislikes. The Batman V Superman fight was slow and pretty boring especially after watching such an amazing fight in Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 2 (If you haven't watched the animated Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 1 and 2 you are sorely missing out on something fantastic). Also, the addition of Wonder Woman who pretty much steals a hacker thing, gives it back and then suits up and fights against a giant monster thing. Not to say I don't like Wonder Woman (She is one of my favorite Superheroes of all time who showed not only can woman kick a** but they also don't need to be ashamed of their sexuality or gender) but she wasn't really that helpful to the plot and just brought in to expand the universe which was well done through Lex's superhuman hunting files. Also, the post-apocalyptic scene that was just a dream could have been cut but nothing is perfect except movies like Citizen Kane which isn't a lot of fun to watch cause it is too perfect. So to summarize, the theatrical cut is bad, the ultimate cut is Amazing and the other cut is meh. Please give it a second chance because it deserves it and save a good director from losing grace because of something he didn't do."
"I really liked it, don't know what all the hate is about. I'm actually a Marvel fan from when I was 7 or so, but Superman and Batman together in 1 movie? Just great. And personally I like Ben Affleck even better than Christian Bale as Batman. So just watch and enjoy, I know I did!"

"That's right. We have been waiting for these two heroes to finally meet and fight against each other. This movie is so good in both plot and special effects.Henry Cavill and Ben Affleck have performed well in their acting stages. They are the best superhero actors and they have filmed their fighting scenes very well. The movie starts to show the conflict between the lives of the heroes and now they have blamed each other for it. This movie is amazing and sets up a good plot for Dawn Justice."

"Actually...I didn't know what to expect. When you see Wonder Woman, you know it will be off of Wonder Woman and off of a Wonder Woman story, but with Batman V Superman, I was like, \"hmmmm, so who is this about?\" It was pretty obvious that it would feature many characters, but I thought the introduction to Batman was amazing. Ben Affleck nailed the part, not only as Batman but also as Bruce Wayne. He is my Batman. Henry Cavill continued to be super as the Man of Steel. And he is my Super - Man. A dark story? Yes, without a doubt. Could it have had a few more jokes? Sure. But not all movies or stories need to have jokes when certain events are serious. I really hope people can see this review and take another look at the movie, because, I loved it. I really hope the ratings can go up, eventually. And P.S, this movie is the perfect set up to Justice League."

"I'll start by making it clear I have only ever seen the Ultimate Edition. I'm aware of what was cut out for the theatrical release, so I will concede up front that most of the criticisms about pacing, editing, and missing bits of plot at release were merited.With that caveat out of the way, I must reiterate that this was bar-none the boldest superhero movie I have ever seen. To me, it was arguably the best as well, though \"best\" shouldn't be taken to mean \"most enjoyable.\" That honor easily goes to \"Thor: Ragnarok.\" What makes BvS stand out among other films in the genre is that it takes two characters who have been done to death since the 1970s and brings them up to date. I recently tried to watch \"Superman: The Movie\" for the first time in a number of years, and while it was still good and Reeves will always be iconic, I just couldn't take it seriously. I'll put it this way: If the story in BvS was \"stupid\" in your view but Superman turning back time by spinning the earth backward on its axis didn't seem like one of the dumbest things you have ever seen -in any movie from any genre- to the extent that it outright ruins the movie for you, then your opinion about BvS isn't worth much. Nostalgic bias was always going to be a problem for this movie, and the way people reacted to and reviewed \"Man of Steel\" was telling in this regard.That brings me to Zack Snyder's take on Superman. You know, that guy whose status as the first extraterrestrial ever encountered by humanity was a total non-issue in the old movies. Apparently, Snyder has a similar view to my own in that his take on the Man of Steel makes his being an alien a core piece of his identity. He may look like any other (absurdly attractive) person, but he knows what he is, and that makes him perpetually uncertain of where he fits in this world. He is essentially good and really does care about people, but he struggles to truly empathize with the likes of us. To be human is to be frail, and that is not something he can easily relate to. This is the root of his conflict with Batman.Just as Clark struggles to genuinely relate to most people, Snyder's Batman either refuses to or otherwise just can't relate to Superman. He doesn't see him as anything but a threat regardless of Superman's clear good intentions. Remember, a small group of Kryptonians were able to bring humanity to the brink of extinction in less than a day, and Bruce Wayne is nothing if not a realist. He didn't know the guy from Kansas. He only knew the god from another world.While Batman's anger toward and fear of Superman are readily apparent from the start, Superman's inability to imagine things from Bruce Wayne's perspective only becomes truly apparent during their first real interaction. This reminded me of the animated version of the \"world's finest\" storyline, where Superman judges Batman harshly for using fear tactics and threats of violence (also, actual violence) to get the job done. Superman wasn't willing to consider what it would take for a human man to fight criminals and save innocents, or what that life would do to him over time. Just as Batman didn't see the guy from Kansas, Superman didn't see the man who lives his life trapped in one brutal, unthinkably traumatic moment (this was beautifully conveyed during the film's opening moments), and had spent his whole adult life bearing witness to humanity at its absolute worst.The conflict between these two characters is as old as human history. They want the same things, but they can't understand one another. So they fight. And what a fight it was.Watching a fight between, say, Captain America and Iron Man was, to me, more frustrating than anything because each understood the other's perspective perfectly. The fight between Batman and Superman in BvS was genuinely gut-wrenching, as intended, because they would have understood one another if either had tried. The whole sequence hilighted Batman's tactical prowess and ability to control a situation. Maybe the most badass thing about the fight was that it ended exactly where Batman planned. That brings me to the big elephant in the room named \"Martha.\"I can't recall exactly which YouTuber put it this way, but if you thought the \"save Martha\" exchange was about their mothers having the same name, you had your brain turned off. The brain-on people have explained this to death, but it bears repeating. This was the moment when Superman became humanized to Batman. He was about to die, and his only concern was for his adoptive human mother. He still believed that the man about to take his life would do the right thing. Even with the cowl on, there was no mistaking the look on Batman's face. It was the look of shame, guilt, and sudden uncertainty that says \"What am I doing?\" Turns out even the most brutal, angry version of Bruce Wayne is better than Tony Stark at knowing right from wrong. At knowing that he had gone too far.From there, the third act was a series of truly impressive (albeit mostly CGI) fight sequences, beginning with what I regard as the undisputed champion of Batman fights. Nothing in the Nolan movies (and especially nothing in the Burton movies) even came close. Go ahead, try to convince yourself that Batman and Bane taking turns punching one another in the face until Bane's mask broke was a good fight sequence. No, this was a fight straight out of \"Arkham Knight,\" and it was glorious. The battle against Doomsday really was one for the books. From the moment Wonder Woman arrived accompanied by the intense sounds of Tina Guo's electric cello to Superman's tragic, heroic death at the hands of Doomsday, I was glued to the screen. Sure, the mere presence of Doomsday spoiled the end to a degree, but watching the Man of Steel laboring to carry that kryptonite spear towards certain death was no less impactful. A brief word on Jesse Eisenberg's take on Lex Luthor. At least one other reviewer on this site already said it best when they pointed out that this was his origin story. If you consider his scheme objectively, he is actually one of the more formidable incarnations of the character. If we're lucky, we'll eventually get to see a Snyder Cut of \"Justice League\" and find out where this story was actually meant to go. For the record, Joss Whedon and Danny Elfman both should have said \"no\" to taking a dump on someone else's art."
"BATMAN V SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE brings a fantastic surprise to a smash-hit team-up with one of the worlds most beloved DC Comics' icons of all time. The movie delivers spectacular casting, and fantastic acting with different characters having their shine in each scenes.The story follows Clark Kent/Superman who becomes a threat, after the destruction in Metropolis in Man Of Steel.(2013). Batman/Bruce Wayne sees him as a threat and begins his war on Superman.The movie brings spectacular storytelling, it tells the complications of human against alien who are on the same side, and the first meeting of Batman and Superman. The story of Bruce Wayne, with his many years of The Caped Crusader, sends him on a spiral of \"out of control\", sheer anger, and builds tension to wanting to defeat the Man of Steel. Snyder has fantastically gave this storytelling an exciting nod to the comics.Lex Luthor, played by Jesse Einsberg, delivers a very interesting performance, but very differently by him showing is his \"origin\" before he becomes a bald foe to the Man of Steel. He shows that his love of \"god vs man\" terrorises mankind when he ultimately creates Doomsday, and Batman realises Superman's inner heroism.It packs so many great \"out of nowhere\" excitement, including a first-look of the fearful Wonder Woman a.k.a. Diana Prince, played by Gal Gadot, and a fresh-new glimpse of the superhero DC canon: The Justice League.WATCH THIS MOVIE! The critics are out of their mind. It's a fun-packed action adventure which still keeps the movie enjoyable until it's final minutes of the movie. It's a FANTASTIC MOVIE! BEN AFFLECK AS BATMAN... is Incredible!A 10/10 overall!"
"I want to go on record as saying that this is a truly thrilling cinematic experience in so many ways. If pressed, I guess I could acknowledge that there were a couple ... let's say \"clumsy\" moments. And in a film that runs to three hours, that hardly seems like a significant issue, certainly not enough to rate it with fewer than 9 stars.This film has everything. There is dramatic tension right from the start. There is a magnificent story arc that picks up quite seamlessly from 'Man of Steel' and propels the viewer not only into the life of Clark Kent/Superman but also of Bruce Wayne/Batman.The villain is no mere cartoon of a villain; he is truly thoroughly (and apparently irrevocably) diabolical. He is a psychopath, and you wish for his death over and over and over. You want Superman to reduce him to ash with the power of his eyes.I have read a number of viewers' reviews, and it seems that the people who disliked the film / gave it a low rating had rather unfair and unrealistic expectations of it. That is, their own prejudices about how the plot could/should unfold or what the character development could/should be, etc. ruined the film for them. And that is a shame.My thought is: I settle into my seat, wait for the lights to dim, and then I wait to be transported by the film. I accept it, lock, stock, and barrel.As another reviewer remarked, I love how the film begins from the point of view of Bruce Wayne as he is among people on the ground who have fallen victim to the attack of Zod and the other Kryptonians.Why would Bruce Wayne not like Superman? Why would the good people of Earth hurl insults at Superman and burn him in effigy (on the news)? Because the good people of Earth just got catapulted into a new reality in which there are not only extraterrestrial beings (surprise!) but they are also superman! And a group of them are hell-bent on destroying humankind and taking the planet for themselves.It is difficult to see Superman as separate from the whole Kryptonian Krew.It seems that many moviegoers forgot that Bruce Wayne is also human. Sure, he's a hero, but he is flawed.. Just like the rest of us. He is a vigilante, after all.He has let his vigilantism get the better of him. HE is actually the one working outside the boundaries of the law, not Superman. It is the clear head of Alfred that shows us that he has gone into a rather dark place, that he has not seen what is really going on (in Luthor's scheme), and so he chooses to embark on his own scheme scheme to take out the alien invader. He is (allegedly) thinking of the future: if he wipes out the all-powerful alien, then it can't turn on humankind in the future. At least, he convinces himself of that.A philosophical question is raised in the film: should Clark Kent have remained a simple man from Kansas and never have become the Superman? Should he just let people die and let calamities happen? The question is answered for us in the character of Diana Prince/Wonder Woman. She withdrew from mankind (her exact words) and just sat around watching. Watching while people died horrible deaths all around her. So, should Superman have done the same? Do these special beings, these 'metahumans', have some kind of moral imperative to intervene, or should they be allowed to be regular people, too? It seems that humans want it both ways.It seems that humans are saying: \"Don't be a superalien ... except when I and my friends and family are in trouble. Then come save us.\""

"Batman v Superman: Ultimate Edition: If your looking for a quick, cheap thrill then you might not enjoy this film at the time. This movies theatrical version was butchered by WB and in doing so reshaped the story leaving numerous plot holes. So the Ultimate Edition is the full story and the one worth seeing. Watch 'Man of Steel' before seeing this movie. There is much to claw through here, so much so that the audience might easily find themselves exhausted from the overall aggression of the film. However, a lot of the story does work. The action is good, and the emotion feels real most of the time.This film is about Superman trying to become Superman. Trying to help the world, save people, find a place in this world not as an outcast, and yet is looked at has a threat by many. Superman is not from this world, yet He is trying to be human, find a place in this world, be excepted by earths people, and come into his destiny.This film is also about Batman being Batman for 20 years and losing faith in humanity, and fearing Superman, what Superman can do with his powers. Great film, great plot, great visuals. ---Yidioo"
"I didn't see the film in the theaters and just bought the \"Extended Edition \" on Amazon. I never properly saw Man of Steel- i think I rented it and watched it when already exhausted and fell asleep. I saw the mediocre user reviews and horrible reviews from critics of this film.They really have it wrong. This is the very best either Batman or Superman. It has a different take, on things. Much darker then earlier films even darker then the Christopher Nolan Batman films.First of all Christopher Nolan is an Executive Producer. So how bad could it be? I loved Sucker Punch and Zack Snyder was involved with that. So how bad could this be? Hans Zimmer did the music, so how bad could it be?I remember watching the old Superman TV shows and reading the Superman and Batman comics as a little kid and loved them, but i wouldn't call myself a \"fan boy\" of comic universes, like so many younger people today. As an older adult I will admit my favorite TV show of all time was Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but watched it on DVD only after it had finished. I saw the second of the Dark Knight series in the theater, but the other two, I watched on DVD. They were great, but not my favorite films like so many people. i also loved the first couple Superman and Batman films in the older series. Regardless, i was not waiting with baited breath to see Man of Steel or this one.I'm more of a serious film fan, who can watch Stanley Kubrick films over and over and my favorite films in the last twenty years, are Eyes Wide Shut and Intersteller, both of which i've watched multiple times.So, with that said, take it from me, the critics have this film very wrong, just as critics hated 2001: A Space Odyssey when it first came out. This film will have lasting appreciation.Surprised how much I liked Ben Afleck's Batman. it was hard to get into Henry Cavil's scrawnier looking Superman, but it grew on me. Amy Adams was great as Lois Lane, The Gal Gadol Wonder Women was amazing. Lex Luther was terrific, like Nolan's Joker. Jeremy Irons was the best Alfred ever. Holly Hunter and Diane Lane was good too. The movie had bad reviews but made a billion dollars. Hopefully everyone buys the Ultimate Edition and it breaks sales records and the film is re-appreciated. I have no idea what scenes this Ultimate Edition added, but it is pretty perfect. Now I can't wait for Wonder Woman and the Justice League and as soon as I finish writing this am going to watch Man of Steal. I'm into it now!I can only surmise that the bad reviews stem from too much expectations of the rigid fan boy types and the radical changes in tone, we see in this film.Total masterpiece of cinema, but I have a few criticisms. There are a few hollow scenes of typical Idiot cops and authorities getting everything wrong in a cliché type way and it has a few filler scenes of that type and a few moments here and there that felt rushed and cheesy. Maybe not everything restored into the Ultimate Edition should have been. I wish there had been more Kevin Costner scenes."

"The whole entire Batman V Superman movie was great and yes even though it felt slow to the majority of the people who watched it but to me I enjoyed every part and every scene of Batman V Superman and when it got to the fight scenes both batman VS Superman and the Doomsday fight it brought so much drama, intensity, and epic performances. So with that being said I give this movie a good 10/10 because it really did go to my expectations and it brought a powerful performance and a powerful yet epic introduction to the upcoming Justice League."

"When I first wrote a review for this movie a year ago exclaiming my excitement for the film, I had been high off a fresh dose of live-action DC superheroes playing out the beloved comic book stories that I had grown up on. It was all playing out before my eyes and coming to life. After a few months had passed, I began to notice things about the movie that I disliked: little gaps in the story, things that didn't add up, etc. My original rating of a 10 / 10 dropped to an 8 /10. But today it has gone back up to a 10. The extended version of the film not only rectifies the gaps but also silences critics.Many claimed that the movie was too dark or that it just didn't make sense. To those people, I say: \"Pick up a comic book!\" Many of the critics of this particular film were part of the superhero bandwagon that formed when Marvel began its spree of Avengers-related films. In fact, its estimated that over 60% of people who go to see 'superhero' genre films have never picked up a comic book in their life. I would argue that similar numbers could figure to those which view the CW televised DC Universe shows. People complain that DC comics is just too dark but the fact is that these movies are based upon actual comics which are meant to be dark (ex: The Dark Knight Returns, Injustice, etc.). Its like complaining that Game of Thrones (the TV series) sucks because they kill off too many characters. Read the books! Its frustrating to see such a beautiful work of art like Batman V Superman criticized by those ignorant to its universe and its meaning. This movie is in fact a catalyst that opens numerous doorways and leaves true fans in awe of the possibilities for future movies. But regardless of whether or not people choose to educate themselves, this film's DVD/Blu-ray extended version puts the theater release to shame. All of the plot holes and gaps are filled in 30 minutes of extended footage scattered throughout the film. The movie ultimately becomes more complete and people will wish that the movie had shown the full 3 hours of footage in its theatrical debut. As a major DC comics fan, I will of course pick up on things that a comics fan would not, but someone who does not read comics would learn to appreciate this film in its entirety with the extended version. Get your hands on a copy today or find it on Netflix or the internet somewhere!"

"I ignored the bad reviews and watched anyways. This film had a lot to live up to after Civil War was released and I went into this film expecting the worst. It ended up to be the best Superhero film of 2016 to me. One complaint was that this film was more concerned about universe building than telling a great story than Civil War but for me it was the other way around; Civil War felt like a build up to something else and to be honest, I felt that way when I saw the other MCU films. Batman vs Superman however not only had a great story, but it also felt a lot more consistent than Civil War. This film was way more diverse with the cast than the MCU but unlike the MCU, I felt like this film doesn't go overboard with the SJW stuff like the MCU films or The Star Wars Sequel films do. The Visuals were AMAZING, The Score by Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL was AMAZING as well, The Tone is just right as I actually felt for the characters emotionally, The Cinematography kept my eyes glued to the screen, and the script felt really Intelligent and Complex and despite people calling the writing confusing, I was able to piece it together with no problem whatsoever. This film is similar to Empire Strikes back in terms of popularity so over time after the other movies are released, this movie would probably be more popular.This film was way better than I Expected and deserves another chance.

"Its shame to see what critics and marvel fans did to this movie and targeted Zack Snyder for it. I have seen this movie more than 25 times till date. And i enjoy this movie as much as i enjoyed the first time. The fans who have read DC comics, wouldn't be disappointed in this movie. Its dark movie, yes it is. Because the title shows the intense situation at hand. Two superheroes about to rip each other apart for whatever reasons that brought them to this stage. Yes it had to be dark and intense.Only marvel can be stupid enough to show an alien invasion where humans are loosing the battle and the super heroes are cracking jokes while battles as if they are playing ping pong. a person playing Call of Duty game is more serious while playing than the marvel heroes fighting aliens."

"Last week some news came out from somebody online who had claimed to have seen a finished version of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. If you were like me, you've been leery of checking it out because you weren't sure how much might actually be true. Now Zack Snyder has spoken out about the spoiler-filled post, although his response doesn't really clear anything up.In a word, to MTV, he called the post \"hilarious,which might imply that he's saying that it's mostly, if not entirely, untrue. That might be the case, but then again he could have just said it was untrue and he didn't say that. What he did say, however, is that he doesn't like spoilers. While this may seem odd for the director who's most recent trailer appeared to give away the entire movie, Snyder says that's not the case. Even if you've seen the trailer, you can rest easy, as there is much more we have not seen in then finished film. Says Snyder I have the benefit of seeing the movie. It's cool that think it's too much, and I appreciate people not wanting to know, but there's plenty that they don't know. There's a lot of movie that's not in the trailer. In the process of calling the Batman v Superman Reddit review hilarious, Snyder goes on to talk about how he hates it when spoilers come out. The director would much rather that fans see the movie mostly blind. While he understands that some fans may wish to find the answers before hand, he wants his movies to be mysteries going in. If you're, as an audience member, exploring these articles, looking for answers to questions that you have, maybe you're okay with knowing before you go. It's like an individual taste. But like I said, I want people to see the movie without knowing.Spoilers are a topic that mean different things to different people. While most try to avoid them to some degree, the need to solve the mystery is a nearly universal human experience. We have an inclination to want to know the truth, even while also wanting to be surprised. For most of us getting some information is good, but getting all the information is bad, of course, only getting the details that you want can be difficult."
"The theatrical is choppy, poorly edited, hard to follow, with some really good moments mixed in their. The extended is much more fluent and is much easier to follow, it does have a long runtime, which might make it seem a bit dragging on, but if you like long films done right, like Lord of the Rings, you will like this movie as long as you get into the characters and story. Speaking of which, the story starts out perfectly showing Bruce Wayne as a character, and it is very powerful. There are several moments in this movie that are powerful, emotional, and shocking. Characters. Batman is my favorite fictional character of all time, and believe me when I say, Ben Affleck as Batman was perfect, he had the charisma, the anger, and the look of being through some bad stuff Gal Gadot also does perfect as Wonder Woman, but if you want to really see how good she does, go watch the Wonder Woman movie. Henry Call as Superman. I really don't like it when people say Christopher Reeves is better. Don't get me wrong, Reeves does great, but can you imagine him as Superman in this movie? I wouldn't like it. It would be like Adam West playing Batman in The Dark Knight. Henry Cavill does great in this role, I can say everything about him as I said with Ben Affleck. Jesse Eisenberg as Luthor. I thought it was different in a good way. I've heard a criticism for him as being too much like Joker, but is that a bad thing? Joker is my favorite villain, so to see Superman have an enemy that crazy, but still hold the values Luthor needs to be Luthor, I think it is great. The thing I thought this movie was lacking in the first and second acts was humor, at least good humor. If there was more humor, I would've given this movie a ten because it would give a more relaxing feel to the parts that needed it. All in all though, this movie was awesome, it had powerful moments, it was badass, and just plain fun. It had a great story arc and does its job very well."

"*I will be talking about the Ultimate Edition of the film* This was one of the most anticipated CBM of all time. Ever since the arrival and subsequent success of Marvel's The Avengers people have wondered when will DC launch its own cinematic universe, one of the main reasons being the opportunity to finally see titans such as Batman and Superman share the screen together: the ultimate nerd dream. On 2016, the moment finally came for BvS to be released AND.. it performed poorly. Not only did critical reception left a lot to be desired, but fan reactions where surprisingly split after its cinematic debut. People either loved it and called Zack a genius, or hated it and called him a hack. Me, personally, I found myself with middle of the road feelings, for sure, but more leaning towards the negative side with subsequent viewings. The theatrical cut of the film showcased amazing performances, incredible visuals, and action set pieces that seemed like comic book panels come to life, in a good way. However, when it comes to its narrative structure and more technical aspects like editing, the film was seriously flawed. More plot holes than Age of Ultron, questionable character decisions, random editing that lacked cohesion and focus, and forced dramatic moments that lacked any impact because the attempts at character development ranged from limited to nonexistent, especially when it comes to Superman's character. I thought it was a 5/10 movie at best. As such, I was kind of skeptical about the idea of a 30 minute longer version. I say kind of because I know how Zack works. I remember Watchmen being vastly improved with its director's cut, so in a way I was expecting BvS to perform in a similar manner, but I also feared those 30 minutes wold be just there to amplify action and discredit storytelling issues. Oh boy, I'm so glad I was proved wrong. The ultimate cut of the film was infuriating, but not because it was awful, but because it questions the sanity of WB executives and editors and makes you wonder what were they thinking during the editing process. What I got out of the Ultimate Edition was a thought-provoking deconstruction of two very iconic superheroes that gave spotlight to the struggles both of them face when they aren't fighting crime. What I got was an extremely well produced character study on both Batman and Superman in a cynical world, a world dangerously close to our own. We meet Batman as a ruthless, worn out hero that has seen the failure behind his ideals and witnessed some truly horrifying things in his life. Superman, on the other hand, is portrayed as a godlike figure that seeks to do good in the world, but finds himself emotionally conflicted once he realized that every good deed he does leaves behind a trail of destruction (most of it due to Luthor's antics). In my opinion, this is a hugely original approach, one that distances itself from the rest of the competition and delivers a dark, somber, yet relevant superhero movie that understands both characters and gives them real human struggles to deal with. I felt invested in both of them, and hoped that by the end of the film both could find a way to redeem themselves. Their character arcs were very well established during the first two acts of the movie, and by the time we get to the titular climactic battle the emotion behind the jaw-dropping action is intensified. Lex Luthor as a villain was also given more time to develop with this new edition. One of the main criticisms with the original version was the fact that his plan relied too much on conveniences, and the character's mannerisms and mad-scientist attitude was annoying, and that goes without saying his motivations were unclear. Not only do we spend more time understanding his hate for any godlike figure and thus his hatred for Superman, but the added scenes allowed us to witness his entire plan come to fruition. It sells the cold, manipulative, calculating attributes of his comic counterpart. The acting is spot on. Every actor owns his/her role, from Cavill's Superman, to Ben Affleck as Batman, Eisenberg as Luthor, and Gadot as Wonder Woman, whose scenes are brief, but are more than enough to sell the strong and ferocious warrior that she is. Cinematography is stunning, and miles above that of Man of Steel's. And the soundtrack by Zimmer and Junkie XL? Perfect, just perfect. When it comes to flaws, the film still has some of those. The Martha moment, while serving as a pivotal character moment for Batman, felt off in execution, and its understandable that many people got mad at it. If your main complaint about BvS the first time around was its bleak tone and subject matter, this film is still not for you. I understand most were expecting to see the heroes being the most iconic versions of themselves, clashing in an elongated battle and evoking the same feelings The Avengers gave audiences back in 2012. In that sense, the film will remain divisive, but at least I have the comfort of saying that, at the very least, the film is competently made."

"This film was amazing. Ben Affleck was easily the best part of this movie, he brought his a-game as Batman. The chemistry between Affleck & Irons was outstanding. Gal Gadot did a great job as Wonder Woman. The fight between Batman & Superman was awesome. The final fight with Doomsday was outstanding in every way possible. However, there is only one problem with this film and that's Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor. He was sadly missed cast in this role, but then again it's really the fault of Warner Bros. Studios. Overall, this film deliver on almost every level. I highly recommend that you watch the extended version of this film."

"I know I know. I saw it in theaters too, and felt like it could've been so much better. While the Batman element was good, the narrative felt fractured, and the third act was just one long stunt scene. Superman was relegated to a supporting character, and other characters didn't get a chance to shine. And then I chanced on the ultimate cut. Calling it 30 mins of \"extra\" footage is unfair to Zack Snyder because it's exactly these 30 mins that makes the movie a worthy one. What I can say about the theatrical cut is this - It had the blockbuster elements - music, visuals, stunts, CGI. But, it lacked the human elements. The first 20 mins of the movie had it, but not after that. The extended cut in comparison has a flow to the narrative. There are no disjointed scenes, everything flows smoothly, and there's connective tissue. Superman gets to spend some time with his father, and mother. Clark Kent does some investigative journalism. Superman helps the people after the blast. Lois Lane doesn't jump to conclusions, she gets to the bottom of the crime. Lex Luthor apparently had a coherent plan - everything is explained pretty well. Wonder Woman was already good, so there's no change there :) Also, the \"Martha\" scene seems better executed, because it is a few seconds longer, and there's time to breathe it in. So, here's my take on this movie - The theatrical cut was junk. Get the Bluray for ultimate edition, and you shall not be disappointed. I've seen it so many more times now, and it's the definitive cut. It is the movie we deserve. It's a unique take on Batman, and Superman. It's a gritty take on the superhero movie genre, and definitely the best DCEU movie, and the best DC movie since The Dark Knight.P.S. Yes it's dark. We're adults, and we should appreciate mature film making without intentionally silly moments. It attempts to be philosophical, and something deep instead of just trying to make you chuckle."

"This is one of the best superhero movies ever made. Zack Snyder is a magician behind the camera.The reason behind so many complaints is the fact that Warner Bros. marketed this movie as a fight between Batman and Superman. That's not what it is. It's a movie about the origins of the Justice League.The cinematography, the acting and the score are all second to none. This film is phenomenal.P.S: watch the 3 hour extended cut that Snyder intended you to see, not the 2 and a half hour movie that Warner Bros. decided would be better for theaters."

"I don't care what the critics say, this is a very well-done movie. I'll start my review by listing what I like about the movie.1.) Ben Affleck is the best batman to me and it is not close. He pulls off the role of an aging batman extremely well. Also, Zack Snyder's vision of batman is legit. I have always hated batman up until this adaptation of him. Instead of being a conflicted and idealistic batman, this batman is dark, gritty, and 100% a badass. His equipment is decked out with machine guns and he has no aversion to killing people. In fact, he probably kills about 50 criminal by the time this movie is over. The warehouse scene is the coolest batman scene in any movie.2.) The development of a grudge between batman and superman is pulled off flawlessly. It actually makes sense why batman dislikes superman. Then, when they do fight it is about the coolest thing you can expect to see from a superhero film. 3.) I disagree with a lot of people about Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor. In my opinion, he played his role to perfection. 4.) B v S sets up Wonder Woman and Justice League with Gal Gadot's cameo as Wonder Woman and short clips of Aquaman, the Flash, and Cyborg. B v S is one of my favorite superhero films and rewatching it never gets old."

"The theatrical cut of this film is garbage which is why I rated it eight stars instead of nine. The first time I watched this film I didn't like it (not straight out hate but didn't like). Character motivations didn't make any sense, Lex was annoying as s***, editing was sloppy, and it was overly dark and broody for an action superhero movie. A year + a half, five Marvel films, a ton of bad reviews and a Justice League later a thought popped into my head: \"what if I watched BVS again\". This time I didn't have trailers ruining the best moments, I only vaguely remembered the film, and I was conditioned to look at it negatively but something unexpected happened: I actually loved it. Superman was just a normal person that tried to make a difference cause he could that others imposed their own beliefs on. Lex Luthor was a genius that couldn't stand his powerlessness compared to Superman or more accurately a super being. As Alfred said \"The fever, the rage, the feeling of powerlessness that turns good men... cruel\" and you see the same thought process in Batman. Batman, just like Lex Luthor feels powerless in the midst of a god-being and just like Lex he attempts to destroy him so he can get his sense of power back but unlike Lex, Batman learns something. I what is one of the corniest lines of the movie Superman says, \"Martha\" when he knows he can't win against Batman in a late desperate attempt to save his mother. Not only does this name connect with Bruce Wayne but it also shows what really matters to a man of steel: it isn't power, it isn't fame or anything else, it is his Mother and on a broader scale it is people. Lex (who doesn't care about people at all) knows he doesn't have the power so he creates something from his blood and the remains of Zod: A Doomsday for Superman. Not only does this film have depth but it also doesn't always explain it to you which is rare in a blockbuster action superhero flick normally cater to semi-comic book fans and people that want to shove popcorn in their mouths. This film rewards you for really noticing the details while still having massive explosions. One of my favorites is how Lex has all of Batman's branded killed which is why he isn't afraid of the branding at the end or Grandma's Peach Tea as a way of scaring the s*** out of someone. Of course, this film isn't perfect and I do have personal dislikes. The Batman V Superman fight was slow and pretty boring especially after watching such an amazing fight in Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 2 (If you haven't watched the animated Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 1 and 2 you are sorely missing out on something fantastic). Also, the addition of Wonder Woman who pretty much steals a hacker thing, gives it back and then suits up and fights against a giant monster thing. Not to say I don't like Wonder Woman (She is one of my favorite Superheroes of all time who showed not only can woman kick a** but they also don't need to be ashamed of their sexuality or gender) but she wasn't really that helpful to the plot and just brought in to expand the universe which was well done through Lex's superhuman hunting files. Also, the post-apocalyptic scene that was just a dream could have been cut but nothing is perfect except movies like Citizen Kane which isn't a lot of fun to watch cause it is too perfect. So to summarize, the theatrical cut is bad, the ultimate cut is Amazing and the other cut is meh. Please give it a second chance because it deserves it and save a good director from losing grace because of something he didn't do."
"I really liked it, don't know what all the hate is about. I'm actually a Marvel fan from when I was 7 or so, but Superman and Batman together in 1 movie? Just great. And personally I like Ben Affleck even better than Christian Bale as Batman. So just watch and enjoy, I know I did!"

"That's right. We have been waiting for these two heroes to finally meet and fight against each other. This movie is so good in both plot and special effects.Henry Cavill and Ben Affleck have performed well in their acting stages. They are the best superhero actors and they have filmed their fighting scenes very well. The movie starts to show the conflict between the lives of the heroes and now they have blamed each other for it. This movie is amazing and sets up a good plot for Dawn Justice."

"Actually...I didn't know what to expect. When you see Wonder Woman, you know it will be off of Wonder Woman and off of a Wonder Woman story, but with Batman V Superman, I was like, \"hmmmm, so who is this about?\" It was pretty obvious that it would feature many characters, but I thought the introduction to Batman was amazing. Ben Affleck nailed the part, not only as Batman but also as Bruce Wayne. He is my Batman. Henry Cavill continued to be super as the Man of Steel. And he is my Super - Man. A dark story? Yes, without a doubt. Could it have had a few more jokes? Sure. But not all movies or stories need to have jokes when certain events are serious. I really hope people can see this review and take another look at the movie, because, I loved it. I really hope the ratings can go up, eventually. And P.S, this movie is the perfect set up to Justice League."

"I'll start by making it clear I have only ever seen the Ultimate Edition. I'm aware of what was cut out for the theatrical release, so I will concede up front that most of the criticisms about pacing, editing, and missing bits of plot at release were merited.With that caveat out of the way, I must reiterate that this was bar-none the boldest superhero movie I have ever seen. To me, it was arguably the best as well, though \"best\" shouldn't be taken to mean \"most enjoyable.\" That honor easily goes to \"Thor: Ragnarok.\" What makes BvS stand out among other films in the genre is that it takes two characters who have been done to death since the 1970s and brings them up to date. I recently tried to watch \"Superman: The Movie\" for the first time in a number of years, and while it was still good and Reeves will always be iconic, I just couldn't take it seriously. I'll put it this way: If the story in BvS was \"stupid\" in your view but Superman turning back time by spinning the earth backward on its axis didn't seem like one of the dumbest things you have ever seen -in any movie from any genre- to the extent that it outright ruins the movie for you, then your opinion about BvS isn't worth much. Nostalgic bias was always going to be a problem for this movie, and the way people reacted to and reviewed \"Man of Steel\" was telling in this regard.That brings me to Zack Snyder's take on Superman. You know, that guy whose status as the first extraterrestrial ever encountered by humanity was a total non-issue in the old movies. Apparently, Snyder has a similar view to my own in that his take on the Man of Steel makes his being an alien a core piece of his identity. He may look like any other (absurdly attractive) person, but he knows what he is, and that makes him perpetually uncertain of where he fits in this world. He is essentially good and really does care about people, but he struggles to truly empathize with the likes of us. To be human is to be frail, and that is not something he can easily relate to. This is the root of his conflict with Batman.Just as Clark struggles to genuinely relate to most people, Snyder's Batman either refuses to or otherwise just can't relate to Superman. He doesn't see him as anything but a threat regardless of Superman's clear good intentions. Remember, a small group of Kryptonians were able to bring humanity to the brink of extinction in less than a day, and Bruce Wayne is nothing if not a realist. He didn't know the guy from Kansas. He only knew the god from another world.While Batman's anger toward and fear of Superman are readily apparent from the start, Superman's inability to imagine things from Bruce Wayne's perspective only becomes truly apparent during their first real interaction. This reminded me of the animated version of the \"world's finest\" storyline, where Superman judges Batman harshly for using fear tactics and threats of violence (also, actual violence) to get the job done. Superman wasn't willing to consider what it would take for a human man to fight criminals and save innocents, or what that life would do to him over time. Just as Batman didn't see the guy from Kansas, Superman didn't see the man who lives his life trapped in one brutal, unthinkably traumatic moment (this was beautifully conveyed during the film's opening moments), and had spent his whole adult life bearing witness to humanity at its absolute worst.The conflict between these two characters is as old as human history. They want the same things, but they can't understand one another. So they fight. And what a fight it was.Watching a fight between, say, Captain America and Iron Man was, to me, more frustrating than anything because each understood the other's perspective perfectly. The fight between Batman and Superman in BvS was genuinely gut-wrenching, as intended, because they would have understood one another if either had tried. The whole sequence hilighted Batman's tactical prowess and ability to control a situation. Maybe the most badass thing about the fight was that it ended exactly where Batman planned. That brings me to the big elephant in the room named \"Martha.\"I can't recall exactly which YouTuber put it this way, but if you thought the \"save Martha\" exchange was about their mothers having the same name, you had your brain turned off. The brain-on people have explained this to death, but it bears repeating. This was the moment when Superman became humanized to Batman. He was about to die, and his only concern was for his adoptive human mother. He still believed that the man about to take his life would do the right thing. Even with the cowl on, there was no mistaking the look on Batman's face. It was the look of shame, guilt, and sudden uncertainty that says \"What am I doing?\" Turns out even the most brutal, angry version of Bruce Wayne is better than Tony Stark at knowing right from wrong. At knowing that he had gone too far.From there, the third act was a series of truly impressive (albeit mostly CGI) fight sequences, beginning with what I regard as the undisputed champion of Batman fights. Nothing in the Nolan movies (and especially nothing in the Burton movies) even came close. Go ahead, try to convince yourself that Batman and Bane taking turns punching one another in the face until Bane's mask broke was a good fight sequence. No, this was a fight straight out of \"Arkham Knight,\" and it was glorious. The battle against Doomsday really was one for the books. From the moment Wonder Woman arrived accompanied by the intense sounds of Tina Guo's electric cello to Superman's tragic, heroic death at the hands of Doomsday, I was glued to the screen. Sure, the mere presence of Doomsday spoiled the end to a degree, but watching the Man of Steel laboring to carry that kryptonite spear towards certain death was no less impactful. A brief word on Jesse Eisenberg's take on Lex Luthor. At least one other reviewer on this site already said it best when they pointed out that this was his origin story. If you consider his scheme objectively, he is actually one of the more formidable incarnations of the character. If we're lucky, we'll eventually get to see a Snyder Cut of \"Justice League\" and find out where this story was actually meant to go. For the record, Joss Whedon and Danny Elfman both should have said \"no\" to taking a dump on someone else's art."
"BATMAN V SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE brings a fantastic surprise to a smash-hit team-up with one of the worlds most beloved DC Comics' icons of all time. The movie delivers spectacular casting, and fantastic acting with different characters having their shine in each scenes.The story follows Clark Kent/Superman who becomes a threat, after the destruction in Metropolis in Man Of Steel.(2013). Batman/Bruce Wayne sees him as a threat and begins his war on Superman.The movie brings spectacular storytelling, it tells the complications of human against alien who are on the same side, and the first meeting of Batman and Superman. The story of Bruce Wayne, with his many years of The Caped Crusader, sends him on a spiral of \"out of control\", sheer anger, and builds tension to wanting to defeat the Man of Steel. Snyder has fantastically gave this storytelling an exciting nod to the comics.Lex Luthor, played by Jesse Einsberg, delivers a very interesting performance, but very differently by him showing is his \"origin\" before he becomes a bald foe to the Man of Steel. He shows that his love of \"god vs man\" terrorises mankind when he ultimately creates Doomsday, and Batman realises Superman's inner heroism.It packs so many great \"out of nowhere\" excitement, including a first-look of the fearful Wonder Woman a.k.a. Diana Prince, played by Gal Gadot, and a fresh-new glimpse of the superhero DC canon: The Justice League.WATCH THIS MOVIE! The critics are out of their mind. It's a fun-packed action adventure which still keeps the movie enjoyable until it's final minutes of the movie. It's a FANTASTIC MOVIE! BEN AFFLECK AS BATMAN... is Incredible!A 10/10 overall!"
"I want to go on record as saying that this is a truly thrilling cinematic experience in so many ways. If pressed, I guess I could acknowledge that there were a couple ... let's say \"clumsy\" moments. And in a film that runs to three hours, that hardly seems like a significant issue, certainly not enough to rate it with fewer than 9 stars.This film has everything. There is dramatic tension right from the start. There is a magnificent story arc that picks up quite seamlessly from 'Man of Steel' and propels the viewer not only into the life of Clark Kent/Superman but also of Bruce Wayne/Batman.The villain is no mere cartoon of a villain; he is truly thoroughly (and apparently irrevocably) diabolical. He is a psychopath, and you wish for his death over and over and over. You want Superman to reduce him to ash with the power of his eyes.I have read a number of viewers' reviews, and it seems that the people who disliked the film / gave it a low rating had rather unfair and unrealistic expectations of it. That is, their own prejudices about how the plot could/should unfold or what the character development could/should be, etc. ruined the film for them. And that is a shame.My thought is: I settle into my seat, wait for the lights to dim, and then I wait to be transported by the film. I accept it, lock, stock, and barrel.As another reviewer remarked, I love how the film begins from the point of view of Bruce Wayne as he is among people on the ground who have fallen victim to the attack of Zod and the other Kryptonians.Why would Bruce Wayne not like Superman? Why would the good people of Earth hurl insults at Superman and burn him in effigy (on the news)? Because the good people of Earth just got catapulted into a new reality in which there are not only extraterrestrial beings (surprise!) but they are also superman! And a group of them are hell-bent on destroying humankind and taking the planet for themselves.It is difficult to see Superman as separate from the whole Kryptonian Krew.It seems that many moviegoers forgot that Bruce Wayne is also human. Sure, he's a hero, but he is flawed.. Just like the rest of us. He is a vigilante, after all.He has let his vigilantism get the better of him. HE is actually the one working outside the boundaries of the law, not Superman. It is the clear head of Alfred that shows us that he has gone into a rather dark place, that he has not seen what is really going on (in Luthor's scheme), and so he chooses to embark on his own scheme scheme to take out the alien invader. He is (allegedly) thinking of the future: if he wipes out the all-powerful alien, then it can't turn on humankind in the future. At least, he convinces himself of that.A philosophical question is raised in the film: should Clark Kent have remained a simple man from Kansas and never have become the Superman? Should he just let people die and let calamities happen? The question is answered for us in the character of Diana Prince/Wonder Woman. She withdrew from mankind (her exact words) and just sat around watching. Watching while people died horrible deaths all around her. So, should Superman have done the same? Do these special beings, these 'metahumans', have some kind of moral imperative to intervene, or should they be allowed to be regular people, too? It seems that humans want it both ways.It seems that humans are saying: \"Don't be a superalien ... except when I and my friends and family are in trouble. Then come save us.\""

"Batman v Superman: Ultimate Edition: If your looking for a quick, cheap thrill then you might not enjoy this film at the time. This movies theatrical version was butchered by WB and in doing so reshaped the story leaving numerous plot holes. So the Ultimate Edition is the full story and the one worth seeing. Watch 'Man of Steel' before seeing this movie. There is much to claw through here, so much so that the audience might easily find themselves exhausted from the overall aggression of the film. However, a lot of the story does work. The action is good, and the emotion feels real most of the time.This film is about Superman trying to become Superman. Trying to help the world, save people, find a place in this world not as an outcast, and yet is looked at has a threat by many. Superman is not from this world, yet He is trying to be human, find a place in this world, be excepted by earths people, and come into his destiny.This film is also about Batman being Batman for 20 years and losing faith in humanity, and fearing Superman, what Superman can do with his powers. Great film, great plot, great visuals. ---Yidioo"
"I didn't see the film in the theaters and just bought the \"Extended Edition \" on Amazon. I never properly saw Man of Steel- i think I rented it and watched it when already exhausted and fell asleep. I saw the mediocre user reviews and horrible reviews from critics of this film.They really have it wrong. This is the very best either Batman or Superman. It has a different take, on things. Much darker then earlier films even darker then the Christopher Nolan Batman films.First of all Christopher Nolan is an Executive Producer. So how bad could it be? I loved Sucker Punch and Zack Snyder was involved with that. So how bad could this be? Hans Zimmer did the music, so how bad could it be?I remember watching the old Superman TV shows and reading the Superman and Batman comics as a little kid and loved them, but i wouldn't call myself a \"fan boy\" of comic universes, like so many younger people today. As an older adult I will admit my favorite TV show of all time was Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but watched it on DVD only after it had finished. I saw the second of the Dark Knight series in the theater, but the other two, I watched on DVD. They were great, but not my favorite films like so many people. i also loved the first couple Superman and Batman films in the older series. Regardless, i was not waiting with baited breath to see Man of Steel or this one.I'm more of a serious film fan, who can watch Stanley Kubrick films over and over and my favorite films in the last twenty years, are Eyes Wide Shut and Intersteller, both of which i've watched multiple times.So, with that said, take it from me, the critics have this film very wrong, just as critics hated 2001: A Space Odyssey when it first came out. This film will have lasting appreciation.Surprised how much I liked Ben Afleck's Batman. it was hard to get into Henry Cavil's scrawnier looking Superman, but it grew on me. Amy Adams was great as Lois Lane, The Gal Gadol Wonder Women was amazing. Lex Luther was terrific, like Nolan's Joker. Jeremy Irons was the best Alfred ever. Holly Hunter and Diane Lane was good too. The movie had bad reviews but made a billion dollars. Hopefully everyone buys the Ultimate Edition and it breaks sales records and the film is re-appreciated. I have no idea what scenes this Ultimate Edition added, but it is pretty perfect. Now I can't wait for Wonder Woman and the Justice League and as soon as I finish writing this am going to watch Man of Steal. I'm into it now!I can only surmise that the bad reviews stem from too much expectations of the rigid fan boy types and the radical changes in tone, we see in this film.Total masterpiece of cinema, but I have a few criticisms. There are a few hollow scenes of typical Idiot cops and authorities getting everything wrong in a cliché type way and it has a few filler scenes of that type and a few moments here and there that felt rushed and cheesy. Maybe not everything restored into the Ultimate Edition should have been. I wish there had been more Kevin Costner scenes."

"The whole entire Batman V Superman movie was great and yes even though it felt slow to the majority of the people who watched it but to me I enjoyed every part and every scene of Batman V Superman and when it got to the fight scenes both batman VS Superman and the Doomsday fight it brought so much drama, intensity, and epic performances. So with that being said I give this movie a good 10/10 because it really did go to my expectations and it brought a powerful performance and a powerful yet epic introduction to the upcoming Justice League."

"Zack Snyder not only understands the characters but he also understands how to craft a real amazing movie for fans - honestly blew me away (extended cut) Brilliant!Don't believe what the internet is telling you to think - take this from a person who has worked in the comic book industry - this is amazing!"

"When I first wrote a review for this movie a year ago exclaiming my excitement for the film, I had been high off a fresh dose of live-action DC superheroes playing out the beloved comic book stories that I had grown up on. It was all playing out before my eyes and coming to life. After a few months had passed, I began to notice things about the movie that I disliked: little gaps in the story, things that didn't add up, etc. My original rating of a 10 / 10 dropped to an 8 /10. But today it has gone back up to a 10. The extended version of the film not only rectifies the gaps but also silences critics.Many claimed that the movie was too dark or that it just didn't make sense. To those people, I say: \"Pick up a comic book!\" Many of the critics of this particular film were part of the superhero bandwagon that formed when Marvel began its spree of Avengers-related films. In fact, its estimated that over 60% of people who go to see 'superhero' genre films have never picked up a comic book in their life. I would argue that similar numbers could figure to those which view the CW televised DC Universe shows. People complain that DC comics is just too dark but the fact is that these movies are based upon actual comics which are meant to be dark (ex: The Dark Knight Returns, Injustice, etc.). Its like complaining that Game of Thrones (the TV series) sucks because they kill off too many characters. Read the books! Its frustrating to see such a beautiful work of art like Batman V Superman criticized by those ignorant to its universe and its meaning. This movie is in fact a catalyst that opens numerous doorways and leaves true fans in awe of the possibilities for future movies. But regardless of whether or not people choose to educate themselves, this film's DVD/Blu-ray extended version puts the theater release to shame. All of the plot holes and gaps are filled in 30 minutes of extended footage scattered throughout the film. The movie ultimately becomes more complete and people will wish that the movie had shown the full 3 hours of footage in its theatrical debut. As a major DC comics fan, I will of course pick up on things that a comics fan would not, but someone who does not read comics would learn to appreciate this film in its entirety with the extended version. Get your hands on a copy today or find it on Netflix or the internet somewhere!"

"I ignored the bad reviews and watched anyways. This film had a lot to live up to after Civil War was released and I went into this film expecting the worst. It ended up to be the best Superhero film of 2016 to me. One complaint was that this film was more concerned about universe building than telling a great story than Civil War but for me it was the other way around; Civil War felt like a build up to something else and to be honest, I felt that way when I saw the other MCU films. Batman vs Superman however not only had a great story, but it also felt a lot more consistent than Civil War. This film was way more diverse with the cast than the MCU but unlike the MCU, I felt like this film doesn't go overboard with the SJW stuff like the MCU films or The Star Wars Sequel films do. The Visuals were AMAZING, The Score by Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL was AMAZING as well, The Tone is just right as I actually felt for the characters emotionally, The Cinematography kept my eyes glued to the screen, and the script felt really Intelligent and Complex and despite people calling the writing confusing, I was able to piece it together with no problem whatsoever. This film is similar to Empire Strikes back in terms of popularity so over time after the other movies are released, this movie would probably be more popular.This film was way better than I Expected and deserves another chance.

"Its shame to see what critics and marvel fans did to this movie and targeted Zack Snyder for it. I have seen this movie more than 25 times till date. And i enjoy this movie as much as i enjoyed the first time. The fans who have read DC comics, wouldn't be disappointed in this movie. Its dark movie, yes it is. Because the title shows the intense situation at hand. Two superheroes about to rip each other apart for whatever reasons that brought them to this stage. Yes it had to be dark and intense.Only marvel can be stupid enough to show an alien invasion where humans are loosing the battle and the super heroes are cracking jokes while battles as if they are playing ping pong. a person playing Call of Duty game is more serious while playing than the marvel heroes fighting aliens."

"Last week some news came out from somebody online who had claimed to have seen a finished version of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. If you were like me, you've been leery of checking it out because you weren't sure how much might actually be true. Now Zack Snyder has spoken out about the spoiler-filled post, although his response doesn't really clear anything up.In a word, to MTV, he called the post \"hilarious,which might imply that he's saying that it's mostly, if not entirely, untrue. That might be the case, but then again he could have just said it was untrue and he didn't say that. What he did say, however, is that he doesn't like spoilers. While this may seem odd for the director who's most recent trailer appeared to give away the entire movie, Snyder says that's not the case. Even if you've seen the trailer, you can rest easy, as there is much more we have not seen in then finished film. Says Snyder I have the benefit of seeing the movie. It's cool that think it's too much, and I appreciate people not wanting to know, but there's plenty that they don't know. There's a lot of movie that's not in the trailer. In the process of calling the Batman v Superman Reddit review hilarious, Snyder goes on to talk about how he hates it when spoilers come out. The director would much rather that fans see the movie mostly blind. While he understands that some fans may wish to find the answers before hand, he wants his movies to be mysteries going in. If you're, as an audience member, exploring these articles, looking for answers to questions that you have, maybe you're okay with knowing before you go. It's like an individual taste. But like I said, I want people to see the movie without knowing.Spoilers are a topic that mean different things to different people. While most try to avoid them to some degree, the need to solve the mystery is a nearly universal human experience. We have an inclination to want to know the truth, even while also wanting to be surprised. For most of us getting some information is good, but getting all the information is bad, of course, only getting the details that you want can be difficult."
"The theatrical is choppy, poorly edited, hard to follow, with some really good moments mixed in their. The extended is much more fluent and is much easier to follow, it does have a long runtime, which might make it seem a bit dragging on, but if you like long films done right, like Lord of the Rings, you will like this movie as long as you get into the characters and story. Speaking of which, the story starts out perfectly showing Bruce Wayne as a character, and it is very powerful. There are several moments in this movie that are powerful, emotional, and shocking. Characters. Batman is my favorite fictional character of all time, and believe me when I say, Ben Affleck as Batman was perfect, he had the charisma, the anger, and the look of being through some bad stuff Gal Gadot also does perfect as Wonder Woman, but if you want to really see how good she does, go watch the Wonder Woman movie. Henry Call as Superman. I really don't like it when people say Christopher Reeves is better. Don't get me wrong, Reeves does great, but can you imagine him as Superman in this movie? I wouldn't like it. It would be like Adam West playing Batman in The Dark Knight. Henry Cavill does great in this role, I can say everything about him as I said with Ben Affleck. Jesse Eisenberg as Luthor. I thought it was different in a good way. I've heard a criticism for him as being too much like Joker, but is that a bad thing? Joker is my favorite villain, so to see Superman have an enemy that crazy, but still hold the values Luthor needs to be Luthor, I think it is great. The thing I thought this movie was lacking in the first and second acts was humor, at least good humor. If there was more humor, I would've given this movie a ten because it would give a more relaxing feel to the parts that needed it. All in all though, this movie was awesome, it had powerful moments, it was badass, and just plain fun. It had a great story arc and does its job very well."

"*I will be talking about the Ultimate Edition of the film* This was one of the most anticipated CBM of all time. Ever since the arrival and subsequent success of Marvel's The Avengers people have wondered when will DC launch its own cinematic universe, one of the main reasons being the opportunity to finally see titans such as Batman and Superman share the screen together: the ultimate nerd dream. On 2016, the moment finally came for BvS to be released AND.. it performed poorly. Not only did critical reception left a lot to be desired, but fan reactions where surprisingly split after its cinematic debut. People either loved it and called Zack a genius, or hated it and called him a hack. Me, personally, I found myself with middle of the road feelings, for sure, but more leaning towards the negative side with subsequent viewings. The theatrical cut of the film showcased amazing performances, incredible visuals, and action set pieces that seemed like comic book panels come to life, in a good way. However, when it comes to its narrative structure and more technical aspects like editing, the film was seriously flawed. More plot holes than Age of Ultron, questionable character decisions, random editing that lacked cohesion and focus, and forced dramatic moments that lacked any impact because the attempts at character development ranged from limited to nonexistent, especially when it comes to Superman's character. I thought it was a 5/10 movie at best. As such, I was kind of skeptical about the idea of a 30 minute longer version. I say kind of because I know how Zack works. I remember Watchmen being vastly improved with its director's cut, so in a way I was expecting BvS to perform in a similar manner, but I also feared those 30 minutes wold be just there to amplify action and discredit storytelling issues. Oh boy, I'm so glad I was proved wrong. The ultimate cut of the film was infuriating, but not because it was awful, but because it questions the sanity of WB executives and editors and makes you wonder what were they thinking during the editing process. What I got out of the Ultimate Edition was a thought-provoking deconstruction of two very iconic superheroes that gave spotlight to the struggles both of them face when they aren't fighting crime. What I got was an extremely well produced character study on both Batman and Superman in a cynical world, a world dangerously close to our own. We meet Batman as a ruthless, worn out hero that has seen the failure behind his ideals and witnessed some truly horrifying things in his life. Superman, on the other hand, is portrayed as a godlike figure that seeks to do good in the world, but finds himself emotionally conflicted once he realized that every good deed he does leaves behind a trail of destruction (most of it due to Luthor's antics). In my opinion, this is a hugely original approach, one that distances itself from the rest of the competition and delivers a dark, somber, yet relevant superhero movie that understands both characters and gives them real human struggles to deal with. I felt invested in both of them, and hoped that by the end of the film both could find a way to redeem themselves. Their character arcs were very well established during the first two acts of the movie, and by the time we get to the titular climactic battle the emotion behind the jaw-dropping action is intensified. Lex Luthor as a villain was also given more time to develop with this new edition. One of the main criticisms with the original version was the fact that his plan relied too much on conveniences, and the character's mannerisms and mad-scientist attitude was annoying, and that goes without saying his motivations were unclear. Not only do we spend more time understanding his hate for any godlike figure and thus his hatred for Superman, but the added scenes allowed us to witness his entire plan come to fruition. It sells the cold, manipulative, calculating attributes of his comic counterpart. The acting is spot on. Every actor owns his/her role, from Cavill's Superman, to Ben Affleck as Batman, Eisenberg as Luthor, and Gadot as Wonder Woman, whose scenes are brief, but are more than enough to sell the strong and ferocious warrior that she is. Cinematography is stunning, and miles above that of Man of Steel's. And the soundtrack by Zimmer and Junkie XL? Perfect, just perfect. When it comes to flaws, the film still has some of those. The Martha moment, while serving as a pivotal character moment for Batman, felt off in execution, and its understandable that many people got mad at it. If your main complaint about BvS the first time around was its bleak tone and subject matter, this film is still not for you. I understand most were expecting to see the heroes being the most iconic versions of themselves, clashing in an elongated battle and evoking the same feelings The Avengers gave audiences back in 2012. In that sense, the film will remain divisive, but at least I have the comfort of saying that, at the very least, the film is competently made."

"This film was amazing. Ben Affleck was easily the best part of this movie, he brought his a-game as Batman. The chemistry between Affleck & Irons was outstanding. Gal Gadot did a great job as Wonder Woman. The fight between Batman & Superman was awesome. The final fight with Doomsday was outstanding in every way possible. However, there is only one problem with this film and that's Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor. He was sadly missed cast in this role, but then again it's really the fault of Warner Bros. Studios. Overall, this film deliver on almost every level. I highly recommend that you watch the extended version of this film."

"I know I know. I saw it in theaters too, and felt like it could've been so much better. While the Batman element was good, the narrative felt fractured, and the third act was just one long stunt scene. Superman was relegated to a supporting character, and other characters didn't get a chance to shine. And then I chanced on the ultimate cut. Calling it 30 mins of \"extra\" footage is unfair to Zack Snyder because it's exactly these 30 mins that makes the movie a worthy one. What I can say about the theatrical cut is this - It had the blockbuster elements - music, visuals, stunts, CGI. But, it lacked the human elements. The first 20 mins of the movie had it, but not after that. The extended cut in comparison has a flow to the narrative. There are no disjointed scenes, everything flows smoothly, and there's connective tissue. Superman gets to spend some time with his father, and mother. Clark Kent does some investigative journalism. Superman helps the people after the blast. Lois Lane doesn't jump to conclusions, she gets to the bottom of the crime. Lex Luthor apparently had a coherent plan - everything is explained pretty well. Wonder Woman was already good, so there's no change there :) Also, the \"Martha\" scene seems better executed, because it is a few seconds longer, and there's time to breathe it in. So, here's my take on this movie - The theatrical cut was junk. Get the Bluray for ultimate edition, and you shall not be disappointed. I've seen it so many more times now, and it's the definitive cut. It is the movie we deserve. It's a unique take on Batman, and Superman. It's a gritty take on the superhero movie genre, and definitely the best DCEU movie, and the best DC movie since The Dark Knight.P.S. Yes it's dark. We're adults, and we should appreciate mature film making without intentionally silly moments. It attempts to be philosophical, and something deep instead of just trying to make you chuckle."

"This is one of the best superhero movies ever made. Zack Snyder is a magician behind the camera.The reason behind so many complaints is the fact that Warner Bros. marketed this movie as a fight between Batman and Superman. That's not what it is. It's a movie about the origins of the Justice League.The cinematography, the acting and the score are all second to none. This film is phenomenal.P.S: watch the 3 hour extended cut that Snyder intended you to see, not the 2 and a half hour movie that Warner Bros. decided would be better for theaters."

"I don't care what the critics say, this is a very well-done movie. I'll start my review by listing what I like about the movie.1.) Ben Affleck is the best batman to me and it is not close. He pulls off the role of an aging batman extremely well. Also, Zack Snyder's vision of batman is legit. I have always hated batman up until this adaptation of him. Instead of being a conflicted and idealistic batman, this batman is dark, gritty, and 100% a badass. His equipment is decked out with machine guns and he has no aversion to killing people. In fact, he probably kills about 50 criminal by the time this movie is over. The warehouse scene is the coolest batman scene in any movie.2.) The development of a grudge between batman and superman is pulled off flawlessly. It actually makes sense why batman dislikes superman. Then, when they do fight it is about the coolest thing you can expect to see from a superhero film. 3.) I disagree with a lot of people about Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor. In my opinion, he played his role to perfection. 4.) B v S sets up Wonder Woman and Justice League with Gal Gadot's cameo as Wonder Woman and short clips of Aquaman, the Flash, and Cyborg. B v S is one of my favorite superhero films and rewatching it never gets old."

"The theatrical cut of this film is garbage which is why I rated it eight stars instead of nine. The first time I watched this film I didn't like it (not straight out hate but didn't like). Character motivations didn't make any sense, Lex was annoying as s***, editing was sloppy, and it was overly dark and broody for an action superhero movie. A year + a half, five Marvel films, a ton of bad reviews and a Justice League later a thought popped into my head: \"what if I watched BVS again\". This time I didn't have trailers ruining the best moments, I only vaguely remembered the film, and I was conditioned to look at it negatively but something unexpected happened: I actually loved it. Superman was just a normal person that tried to make a difference cause he could that others imposed their own beliefs on. Lex Luthor was a genius that couldn't stand his powerlessness compared to Superman or more accurately a super being. As Alfred said \"The fever, the rage, the feeling of powerlessness that turns good men... cruel\" and you see the same thought process in Batman. Batman, just like Lex Luthor feels powerless in the midst of a god-being and just like Lex he attempts to destroy him so he can get his sense of power back but unlike Lex, Batman learns something. I what is one of the corniest lines of the movie Superman says, \"Martha\" when he knows he can't win against Batman in a late desperate attempt to save his mother. Not only does this name connect with Bruce Wayne but it also shows what really matters to a man of steel: it isn't power, it isn't fame or anything else, it is his Mother and on a broader scale it is people. Lex (who doesn't care about people at all) knows he doesn't have the power so he creates something from his blood and the remains of Zod: A Doomsday for Superman. Not only does this film have depth but it also doesn't always explain it to you which is rare in a blockbuster action superhero flick normally cater to semi-comic book fans and people that want to shove popcorn in their mouths. This film rewards you for really noticing the details while still having massive explosions. One of my favorites is how Lex has all of Batman's branded killed which is why he isn't afraid of the branding at the end or Grandma's Peach Tea as a way of scaring the s*** out of someone. Of course, this film isn't perfect and I do have personal dislikes. The Batman V Superman fight was slow and pretty boring especially after watching such an amazing fight in Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 2 (If you haven't watched the animated Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 1 and 2 you are sorely missing out on something fantastic). Also, the addition of Wonder Woman who pretty much steals a hacker thing, gives it back and then suits up and fights against a giant monster thing. Not to say I don't like Wonder Woman (She is one of my favorite Superheroes of all time who showed not only can woman kick a** but they also don't need to be ashamed of their sexuality or gender) but she wasn't really that helpful to the plot and just brought in to expand the universe which was well done through Lex's superhuman hunting files. Also, the post-apocalyptic scene that was just a dream could have been cut but nothing is perfect except movies like Citizen Kane which isn't a lot of fun to watch cause it is too perfect. So to summarize, the theatrical cut is bad, the ultimate cut is Amazing and the other cut is meh. Please give it a second chance because it deserves it and save a good director from losing grace because of something he didn't do."
"I really liked it, don't know what all the hate is about. I'm actually a Marvel fan from when I was 7 or so, but Superman and Batman together in 1 movie? Just great. And personally I like Ben Affleck even better than Christian Bale as Batman. So just watch and enjoy, I know I did!"

"That's right. We have been waiting for these two heroes to finally meet and fight against each other. This movie is so good in both plot and special effects.Henry Cavill and Ben Affleck have performed well in their acting stages. They are the best superhero actors and they have filmed their fighting scenes very well. The movie starts to show the conflict between the lives of the heroes and now they have blamed each other for it. This movie is amazing and sets up a good plot for Dawn Justice."

"Actually...I didn't know what to expect. When you see Wonder Woman, you know it will be off of Wonder Woman and off of a Wonder Woman story, but with Batman V Superman, I was like, \"hmmmm, so who is this about?\" It was pretty obvious that it would feature many characters, but I thought the introduction to Batman was amazing. Ben Affleck nailed the part, not only as Batman but also as Bruce Wayne. He is my Batman. Henry Cavill continued to be super as the Man of Steel. And he is my Super - Man. A dark story? Yes, without a doubt. Could it have had a few more jokes? Sure. But not all movies or stories need to have jokes when certain events are serious. I really hope people can see this review and take another look at the movie, because, I loved it. I really hope the ratings can go up, eventually. And P.S, this movie is the perfect set up to Justice League."

"I'll start by making it clear I have only ever seen the Ultimate Edition. I'm aware of what was cut out for the theatrical release, so I will concede up front that most of the criticisms about pacing, editing, and missing bits of plot at release were merited.With that caveat out of the way, I must reiterate that this was bar-none the boldest superhero movie I have ever seen. To me, it was arguably the best as well, though \"best\" shouldn't be taken to mean \"most enjoyable.\" That honor easily goes to \"Thor: Ragnarok.\" What makes BvS stand out among other films in the genre is that it takes two characters who have been done to death since the 1970s and brings them up to date. I recently tried to watch \"Superman: The Movie\" for the first time in a number of years, and while it was still good and Reeves will always be iconic, I just couldn't take it seriously. I'll put it this way: If the story in BvS was \"stupid\" in your view but Superman turning back time by spinning the earth backward on its axis didn't seem like one of the dumbest things you have ever seen -in any movie from any genre- to the extent that it outright ruins the movie for you, then your opinion about BvS isn't worth much. Nostalgic bias was always going to be a problem for this movie, and the way people reacted to and reviewed \"Man of Steel\" was telling in this regard.That brings me to Zack Snyder's take on Superman. You know, that guy whose status as the first extraterrestrial ever encountered by humanity was a total non-issue in the old movies. Apparently, Snyder has a similar view to my own in that his take on the Man of Steel makes his being an alien a core piece of his identity. He may look like any other (absurdly attractive) person, but he knows what he is, and that makes him perpetually uncertain of where he fits in this world. He is essentially good and really does care about people, but he struggles to truly empathize with the likes of us. To be human is to be frail, and that is not something he can easily relate to. This is the root of his conflict with Batman.Just as Clark struggles to genuinely relate to most people, Snyder's Batman either refuses to or otherwise just can't relate to Superman. He doesn't see him as anything but a threat regardless of Superman's clear good intentions. Remember, a small group of Kryptonians were able to bring humanity to the brink of extinction in less than a day, and Bruce Wayne is nothing if not a realist. He didn't know the guy from Kansas. He only knew the god from another world.While Batman's anger toward and fear of Superman are readily apparent from the start, Superman's inability to imagine things from Bruce Wayne's perspective only becomes truly apparent during their first real interaction. This reminded me of the animated version of the \"world's finest\" storyline, where Superman judges Batman harshly for using fear tactics and threats of violence (also, actual violence) to get the job done. Superman wasn't willing to consider what it would take for a human man to fight criminals and save innocents, or what that life would do to him over time. Just as Batman didn't see the guy from Kansas, Superman didn't see the man who lives his life trapped in one brutal, unthinkably traumatic moment (this was beautifully conveyed during the film's opening moments), and had spent his whole adult life bearing witness to humanity at its absolute worst.The conflict between these two characters is as old as human history. They want the same things, but they can't understand one another. So they fight. And what a fight it was.Watching a fight between, say, Captain America and Iron Man was, to me, more frustrating than anything because each understood the other's perspective perfectly. The fight between Batman and Superman in BvS was genuinely gut-wrenching, as intended, because they would have understood one another if either had tried. The whole sequence hilighted Batman's tactical prowess and ability to control a situation. Maybe the most badass thing about the fight was that it ended exactly where Batman planned. That brings me to the big elephant in the room named \"Martha.\"I can't recall exactly which YouTuber put it this way, but if you thought the \"save Martha\" exchange was about their mothers having the same name, you had your brain turned off. The brain-on people have explained this to death, but it bears repeating. This was the moment when Superman became humanized to Batman. He was about to die, and his only concern was for his adoptive human mother. He still believed that the man about to take his life would do the right thing. Even with the cowl on, there was no mistaking the look on Batman's face. It was the look of shame, guilt, and sudden uncertainty that says \"What am I doing?\" Turns out even the most brutal, angry version of Bruce Wayne is better than Tony Stark at knowing right from wrong. At knowing that he had gone too far.From there, the third act was a series of truly impressive (albeit mostly CGI) fight sequences, beginning with what I regard as the undisputed champion of Batman fights. Nothing in the Nolan movies (and especially nothing in the Burton movies) even came close. Go ahead, try to convince yourself that Batman and Bane taking turns punching one another in the face until Bane's mask broke was a good fight sequence. No, this was a fight straight out of \"Arkham Knight,\" and it was glorious. The battle against Doomsday really was one for the books. From the moment Wonder Woman arrived accompanied by the intense sounds of Tina Guo's electric cello to Superman's tragic, heroic death at the hands of Doomsday, I was glued to the screen. Sure, the mere presence of Doomsday spoiled the end to a degree, but watching the Man of Steel laboring to carry that kryptonite spear towards certain death was no less impactful. A brief word on Jesse Eisenberg's take on Lex Luthor. At least one other reviewer on this site already said it best when they pointed out that this was his origin story. If you consider his scheme objectively, he is actually one of the more formidable incarnations of the character. If we're lucky, we'll eventually get to see a Snyder Cut of \"Justice League\" and find out where this story was actually meant to go. For the record, Joss Whedon and Danny Elfman both should have said \"no\" to taking a dump on someone else's art."
"BATMAN V SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE brings a fantastic surprise to a smash-hit team-up with one of the worlds most beloved DC Comics' icons of all time. The movie delivers spectacular casting, and fantastic acting with different characters having their shine in each scenes.The story follows Clark Kent/Superman who becomes a threat, after the destruction in Metropolis in Man Of Steel.(2013). Batman/Bruce Wayne sees him as a threat and begins his war on Superman.The movie brings spectacular storytelling, it tells the complications of human against alien who are on the same side, and the first meeting of Batman and Superman. The story of Bruce Wayne, with his many years of The Caped Crusader, sends him on a spiral of \"out of control\", sheer anger, and builds tension to wanting to defeat the Man of Steel. Snyder has fantastically gave this storytelling an exciting nod to the comics.Lex Luthor, played by Jesse Einsberg, delivers a very interesting performance, but very differently by him showing is his \"origin\" before he becomes a bald foe to the Man of Steel. He shows that his love of \"god vs man\" terrorises mankind when he ultimately creates Doomsday, and Batman realises Superman's inner heroism.It packs so many great \"out of nowhere\" excitement, including a first-look of the fearful Wonder Woman a.k.a. Diana Prince, played by Gal Gadot, and a fresh-new glimpse of the superhero DC canon: The Justice League.WATCH THIS MOVIE! The critics are out of their mind. It's a fun-packed action adventure which still keeps the movie enjoyable until it's final minutes of the movie. It's a FANTASTIC MOVIE! BEN AFFLECK AS BATMAN... is Incredible!A 10/10 overall!"
"I want to go on record as saying that this is a truly thrilling cinematic experience in so many ways. If pressed, I guess I could acknowledge that there were a couple ... let's say \"clumsy\" moments. And in a film that runs to three hours, that hardly seems like a significant issue, certainly not enough to rate it with fewer than 9 stars.This film has everything. There is dramatic tension right from the start. There is a magnificent story arc that picks up quite seamlessly from 'Man of Steel' and propels the viewer not only into the life of Clark Kent/Superman but also of Bruce Wayne/Batman.The villain is no mere cartoon of a villain; he is truly thoroughly (and apparently irrevocably) diabolical. He is a psychopath, and you wish for his death over and over and over. You want Superman to reduce him to ash with the power of his eyes.I have read a number of viewers' reviews, and it seems that the people who disliked the film / gave it a low rating had rather unfair and unrealistic expectations of it. That is, their own prejudices about how the plot could/should unfold or what the character development could/should be, etc. ruined the film for them. And that is a shame.My thought is: I settle into my seat, wait for the lights to dim, and then I wait to be transported by the film. I accept it, lock, stock, and barrel.As another reviewer remarked, I love how the film begins from the point of view of Bruce Wayne as he is among people on the ground who have fallen victim to the attack of Zod and the other Kryptonians.Why would Bruce Wayne not like Superman? Why would the good people of Earth hurl insults at Superman and burn him in effigy (on the news)? Because the good people of Earth just got catapulted into a new reality in which there are not only extraterrestrial beings (surprise!) but they are also superman! And a group of them are hell-bent on destroying humankind and taking the planet for themselves.It is difficult to see Superman as separate from the whole Kryptonian Krew.It seems that many moviegoers forgot that Bruce Wayne is also human. Sure, he's a hero, but he is flawed.. Just like the rest of us. He is a vigilante, after all.He has let his vigilantism get the better of him. HE is actually the one working outside the boundaries of the law, not Superman. It is the clear head of Alfred that shows us that he has gone into a rather dark place, that he has not seen what is really going on (in Luthor's scheme), and so he chooses to embark on his own scheme scheme to take out the alien invader. He is (allegedly) thinking of the future: if he wipes out the all-powerful alien, then it can't turn on humankind in the future. At least, he convinces himself of that.A philosophical question is raised in the film: should Clark Kent have remained a simple man from Kansas and never have become the Superman? Should he just let people die and let calamities happen? The question is answered for us in the character of Diana Prince/Wonder Woman. She withdrew from mankind (her exact words) and just sat around watching. Watching while people died horrible deaths all around her. So, should Superman have done the same? Do these special beings, these 'metahumans', have some kind of moral imperative to intervene, or should they be allowed to be regular people, too? It seems that humans want it both ways.It seems that humans are saying: \"Don't be a superalien ... except when I and my friends and family are in trouble. Then come save us.\""

"Batman v Superman: Ultimate Edition: If your looking for a quick, cheap thrill then you might not enjoy this film at the time. This movies theatrical version was butchered by WB and in doing so reshaped the story leaving numerous plot holes. So the Ultimate Edition is the full story and the one worth seeing. Watch 'Man of Steel' before seeing this movie. There is much to claw through here, so much so that the audience might easily find themselves exhausted from the overall aggression of the film. However, a lot of the story does work. The action is good, and the emotion feels real most of the time.This film is about Superman trying to become Superman. Trying to help the world, save people, find a place in this world not as an outcast, and yet is looked at has a threat by many. Superman is not from this world, yet He is trying to be human, find a place in this world, be excepted by earths people, and come into his destiny.This film is also about Batman being Batman for 20 years and losing faith in humanity, and fearing Superman, what Superman can do with his powers. Great film, great plot, great visuals. ---Yidioo"
"I didn't see the film in the theaters and just bought the \"Extended Edition \" on Amazon. I never properly saw Man of Steel- i think I rented it and watched it when already exhausted and fell asleep. I saw the mediocre user reviews and horrible reviews from critics of this film.They really have it wrong. This is the very best either Batman or Superman. It has a different take, on things. Much darker then earlier films even darker then the Christopher Nolan Batman films.First of all Christopher Nolan is an Executive Producer. So how bad could it be? I loved Sucker Punch and Zack Snyder was involved with that. So how bad could this be? Hans Zimmer did the music, so how bad could it be?I remember watching the old Superman TV shows and reading the Superman and Batman comics as a little kid and loved them, but i wouldn't call myself a \"fan boy\" of comic universes, like so many younger people today. As an older adult I will admit my favorite TV show of all time was Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but watched it on DVD only after it had finished. I saw the second of the Dark Knight series in the theater, but the other two, I watched on DVD. They were great, but not my favorite films like so many people. i also loved the first couple Superman and Batman films in the older series. Regardless, i was not waiting with baited breath to see Man of Steel or this one.I'm more of a serious film fan, who can watch Stanley Kubrick films over and over and my favorite films in the last twenty years, are Eyes Wide Shut and Intersteller, both of which i've watched multiple times.So, with that said, take it from me, the critics have this film very wrong, just as critics hated 2001: A Space Odyssey when it first came out. This film will have lasting appreciation.Surprised how much I liked Ben Afleck's Batman. it was hard to get into Henry Cavil's scrawnier looking Superman, but it grew on me. Amy Adams was great as Lois Lane, The Gal Gadol Wonder Women was amazing. Lex Luther was terrific, like Nolan's Joker. Jeremy Irons was the best Alfred ever. Holly Hunter and Diane Lane was good too. The movie had bad reviews but made a billion dollars. Hopefully everyone buys the Ultimate Edition and it breaks sales records and the film is re-appreciated. I have no idea what scenes this Ultimate Edition added, but it is pretty perfect. Now I can't wait for Wonder Woman and the Justice League and as soon as I finish writing this am going to watch Man of Steal. I'm into it now!I can only surmise that the bad reviews stem from too much expectations of the rigid fan boy types and the radical changes in tone, we see in this film.Total masterpiece of cinema, but I have a few criticisms. There are a few hollow scenes of typical Idiot cops and authorities getting everything wrong in a cliché type way and it has a few filler scenes of that type and a few moments here and there that felt rushed and cheesy. Maybe not everything restored into the Ultimate Edition should have been. I wish there had been more Kevin Costner scenes."

"The whole entire Batman V Superman movie was great and yes even though it felt slow to the majority of the people who watched it but to me I enjoyed every part and every scene of Batman V Superman and when it got to the fight scenes both batman VS Superman and the Doomsday fight it brought so much drama, intensity, and epic performances. So with that being said I give this movie a good 10/10 because it really did go to my expectations and it brought a powerful performance and a powerful yet epic introduction to the upcoming Justice League."

"When I first wrote a review for this movie a year ago exclaiming my excitement for the film, I had been high off a fresh dose of live-action DC superheroes playing out the beloved comic book stories that I had grown up on. It was all playing out before my eyes and coming to life. After a few months had passed, I began to notice things about the movie that I disliked: little gaps in the story, things that didn't add up, etc. My original rating of a 10 / 10 dropped to an 8 /10. But today it has gone back up to a 10. The extended version of the film not only rectifies the gaps but also silences critics.Many claimed that the movie was too dark or that it just didn't make sense. To those people, I say: \"Pick up a comic book!\" Many of the critics of this particular film were part of the superhero bandwagon that formed when Marvel began its spree of Avengers-related films. In fact, its estimated that over 60% of people who go to see 'superhero' genre films have never picked up a comic book in their life. I would argue that similar numbers could figure to those which view the CW televised DC Universe shows. People complain that DC comics is just too dark but the fact is that these movies are based upon actual comics which are meant to be dark (ex: The Dark Knight Returns, Injustice, etc.). Its like complaining that Game of Thrones (the TV series) sucks because they kill off too many characters. Read the books! Its frustrating to see such a beautiful work of art like Batman V Superman criticized by those ignorant to its universe and its meaning. This movie is in fact a catalyst that opens numerous doorways and leaves true fans in awe of the possibilities for future movies. But regardless of whether or not people choose to educate themselves, this film's DVD/Blu-ray extended version puts the theater release to shame. All of the plot holes and gaps are filled in 30 minutes of extended footage scattered throughout the film. The movie ultimately becomes more complete and people will wish that the movie had shown the full 3 hours of footage in its theatrical debut. As a major DC comics fan, I will of course pick up on things that a comics fan would not, but someone who does not read comics would learn to appreciate this film in its entirety with the extended version. Get your hands on a copy today or find it on Netflix or the internet somewhere!"

"I ignored the bad reviews and watched anyways. This film had a lot to live up to after Civil War was released and I went into this film expecting the worst. It ended up to be the best Superhero film of 2016 to me. One complaint was that this film was more concerned about universe building than telling a great story than Civil War but for me it was the other way around; Civil War felt like a build up to something else and to be honest, I felt that way when I saw the other MCU films. Batman vs Superman however not only had a great story, but it also felt a lot more consistent than Civil War. This film was way more diverse with the cast than the MCU but unlike the MCU, I felt like this film doesn't go overboard with the SJW stuff like the MCU films or The Star Wars Sequel films do. The Visuals were AMAZING, The Score by Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL was AMAZING as well, The Tone is just right as I actually felt for the characters emotionally, The Cinematography kept my eyes glued to the screen, and the script felt really Intelligent and Complex and despite people calling the writing confusing, I was able to piece it together with no problem whatsoever. This film is similar to Empire Strikes back in terms of popularity so over time after the other movies are released, this movie would probably be more popular.This film was way better than I Expected and deserves another chance.

"Its shame to see what critics and marvel fans did to this movie and targeted Zack Snyder for it. I have seen this movie more than 25 times till date. And i enjoy this movie as much as i enjoyed the first time. The fans who have read DC comics, wouldn't be disappointed in this movie. Its dark movie, yes it is. Because the title shows the intense situation at hand. Two superheroes about to rip each other apart for whatever reasons that brought them to this stage. Yes it had to be dark and intense.Only marvel can be stupid enough to show an alien invasion where humans are loosing the battle and the super heroes are cracking jokes while battles as if they are playing ping pong. a person playing Call of Duty game is more serious while playing than the marvel heroes fighting aliens."

"Last week some news came out from somebody online who had claimed to have seen a finished version of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. If you were like me, you've been leery of checking it out because you weren't sure how much might actually be true. Now Zack Snyder has spoken out about the spoiler-filled post, although his response doesn't really clear anything up.In a word, to MTV, he called the post \"hilarious,which might imply that he's saying that it's mostly, if not entirely, untrue. That might be the case, but then again he could have just said it was untrue and he didn't say that. What he did say, however, is that he doesn't like spoilers. While this may seem odd for the director who's most recent trailer appeared to give away the entire movie, Snyder says that's not the case. Even if you've seen the trailer, you can rest easy, as there is much more we have not seen in then finished film. Says Snyder I have the benefit of seeing the movie. It's cool that think it's too much, and I appreciate people not wanting to know, but there's plenty that they don't know. There's a lot of movie that's not in the trailer. In the process of calling the Batman v Superman Reddit review hilarious, Snyder goes on to talk about how he hates it when spoilers come out. The director would much rather that fans see the movie mostly blind. While he understands that some fans may wish to find the answers before hand, he wants his movies to be mysteries going in. If you're, as an audience member, exploring these articles, looking for answers to questions that you have, maybe you're okay with knowing before you go. It's like an individual taste. But like I said, I want people to see the movie without knowing.Spoilers are a topic that mean different things to different people. While most try to avoid them to some degree, the need to solve the mystery is a nearly universal human experience. We have an inclination to want to know the truth, even while also wanting to be surprised. For most of us getting some information is good, but getting all the information is bad, of course, only getting the details that you want can be difficult."
"The theatrical is choppy, poorly edited, hard to follow, with some really good moments mixed in their. The extended is much more fluent and is much easier to follow, it does have a long runtime, which might make it seem a bit dragging on, but if you like long films done right, like Lord of the Rings, you will like this movie as long as you get into the characters and story. Speaking of which, the story starts out perfectly showing Bruce Wayne as a character, and it is very powerful. There are several moments in this movie that are powerful, emotional, and shocking. Characters. Batman is my favorite fictional character of all time, and believe me when I say, Ben Affleck as Batman was perfect, he had the charisma, the anger, and the look of being through some bad stuff Gal Gadot also does perfect as Wonder Woman, but if you want to really see how good she does, go watch the Wonder Woman movie. Henry Call as Superman. I really don't like it when people say Christopher Reeves is better. Don't get me wrong, Reeves does great, but can you imagine him as Superman in this movie? I wouldn't like it. It would be like Adam West playing Batman in The Dark Knight. Henry Cavill does great in this role, I can say everything about him as I said with Ben Affleck. Jesse Eisenberg as Luthor. I thought it was different in a good way. I've heard a criticism for him as being too much like Joker, but is that a bad thing? Joker is my favorite villain, so to see Superman have an enemy that crazy, but still hold the values Luthor needs to be Luthor, I think it is great. The thing I thought this movie was lacking in the first and second acts was humor, at least good humor. If there was more humor, I would've given this movie a ten because it would give a more relaxing feel to the parts that needed it. All in all though, this movie was awesome, it had powerful moments, it was badass, and just plain fun. It had a great story arc and does its job very well."

"*I will be talking about the Ultimate Edition of the film* This was one of the most anticipated CBM of all time. Ever since the arrival and subsequent success of Marvel's The Avengers people have wondered when will DC launch its own cinematic universe, one of the main reasons being the opportunity to finally see titans such as Batman and Superman share the screen together: the ultimate nerd dream. On 2016, the moment finally came for BvS to be released AND.. it performed poorly. Not only did critical reception left a lot to be desired, but fan reactions where surprisingly split after its cinematic debut. People either loved it and called Zack a genius, or hated it and called him a hack. Me, personally, I found myself with middle of the road feelings, for sure, but more leaning towards the negative side with subsequent viewings. The theatrical cut of the film showcased amazing performances, incredible visuals, and action set pieces that seemed like comic book panels come to life, in a good way. However, when it comes to its narrative structure and more technical aspects like editing, the film was seriously flawed. More plot holes than Age of Ultron, questionable character decisions, random editing that lacked cohesion and focus, and forced dramatic moments that lacked any impact because the attempts at character development ranged from limited to nonexistent, especially when it comes to Superman's character. I thought it was a 5/10 movie at best. As such, I was kind of skeptical about the idea of a 30 minute longer version. I say kind of because I know how Zack works. I remember Watchmen being vastly improved with its director's cut, so in a way I was expecting BvS to perform in a similar manner, but I also feared those 30 minutes wold be just there to amplify action and discredit storytelling issues. Oh boy, I'm so glad I was proved wrong. The ultimate cut of the film was infuriating, but not because it was awful, but because it questions the sanity of WB executives and editors and makes you wonder what were they thinking during the editing process. What I got out of the Ultimate Edition was a thought-provoking deconstruction of two very iconic superheroes that gave spotlight to the struggles both of them face when they aren't fighting crime. What I got was an extremely well produced character study on both Batman and Superman in a cynical world, a world dangerously close to our own. We meet Batman as a ruthless, worn out hero that has seen the failure behind his ideals and witnessed some truly horrifying things in his life. Superman, on the other hand, is portrayed as a godlike figure that seeks to do good in the world, but finds himself emotionally conflicted once he realized that every good deed he does leaves behind a trail of destruction (most of it due to Luthor's antics). In my opinion, this is a hugely original approach, one that distances itself from the rest of the competition and delivers a dark, somber, yet relevant superhero movie that understands both characters and gives them real human struggles to deal with. I felt invested in both of them, and hoped that by the end of the film both could find a way to redeem themselves. Their character arcs were very well established during the first two acts of the movie, and by the time we get to the titular climactic battle the emotion behind the jaw-dropping action is intensified. Lex Luthor as a villain was also given more time to develop with this new edition. One of the main criticisms with the original version was the fact that his plan relied too much on conveniences, and the character's mannerisms and mad-scientist attitude was annoying, and that goes without saying his motivations were unclear. Not only do we spend more time understanding his hate for any godlike figure and thus his hatred for Superman, but the added scenes allowed us to witness his entire plan come to fruition. It sells the cold, manipulative, calculating attributes of his comic counterpart. The acting is spot on. Every actor owns his/her role, from Cavill's Superman, to Ben Affleck as Batman, Eisenberg as Luthor, and Gadot as Wonder Woman, whose scenes are brief, but are more than enough to sell the strong and ferocious warrior that she is. Cinematography is stunning, and miles above that of Man of Steel's. And the soundtrack by Zimmer and Junkie XL? Perfect, just perfect. When it comes to flaws, the film still has some of those. The Martha moment, while serving as a pivotal character moment for Batman, felt off in execution, and its understandable that many people got mad at it. If your main complaint about BvS the first time around was its bleak tone and subject matter, this film is still not for you. I understand most were expecting to see the heroes being the most iconic versions of themselves, clashing in an elongated battle and evoking the same feelings The Avengers gave audiences back in 2012. In that sense, the film will remain divisive, but at least I have the comfort of saying that, at the very least, the film is competently made."

"This film was amazing. Ben Affleck was easily the best part of this movie, he brought his a-game as Batman. The chemistry between Affleck & Irons was outstanding. Gal Gadot did a great job as Wonder Woman. The fight between Batman & Superman was awesome. The final fight with Doomsday was outstanding in every way possible. However, there is only one problem with this film and that's Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor. He was sadly missed cast in this role, but then again it's really the fault of Warner Bros. Studios. Overall, this film deliver on almost every level. I highly recommend that you watch the extended version of this film."

"I know I know. I saw it in theaters too, and felt like it could've been so much better. While the Batman element was good, the narrative felt fractured, and the third act was just one long stunt scene. Superman was relegated to a supporting character, and other characters didn't get a chance to shine. And then I chanced on the ultimate cut. Calling it 30 mins of \"extra\" footage is unfair to Zack Snyder because it's exactly these 30 mins that makes the movie a worthy one. What I can say about the theatrical cut is this - It had the blockbuster elements - music, visuals, stunts, CGI. But, it lacked the human elements. The first 20 mins of the movie had it, but not after that. The extended cut in comparison has a flow to the narrative. There are no disjointed scenes, everything flows smoothly, and there's connective tissue. Superman gets to spend some time with his father, and mother. Clark Kent does some investigative journalism. Superman helps the people after the blast. Lois Lane doesn't jump to conclusions, she gets to the bottom of the crime. Lex Luthor apparently had a coherent plan - everything is explained pretty well. Wonder Woman was already good, so there's no change there :) Also, the \"Martha\" scene seems better executed, because it is a few seconds longer, and there's time to breathe it in. So, here's my take on this movie - The theatrical cut was junk. Get the Bluray for ultimate edition, and you shall not be disappointed. I've seen it so many more times now, and it's the definitive cut. It is the movie we deserve. It's a unique take on Batman, and Superman. It's a gritty take on the superhero movie genre, and definitely the best DCEU movie, and the best DC movie since The Dark Knight.P.S. Yes it's dark. We're adults, and we should appreciate mature film making without intentionally silly moments. It attempts to be philosophical, and something deep instead of just trying to make you chuckle."

"This is one of the best superhero movies ever made. Zack Snyder is a magician behind the camera.The reason behind so many complaints is the fact that Warner Bros. marketed this movie as a fight between Batman and Superman. That's not what it is. It's a movie about the origins of the Justice League.The cinematography, the acting and the score are all second to none. This film is phenomenal.P.S: watch the 3 hour extended cut that Snyder intended you to see, not the 2 and a half hour movie that Warner Bros. decided would be better for theaters."

"I don't care what the critics say, this is a very well-done movie. I'll start my review by listing what I like about the movie.1.) Ben Affleck is the best batman to me and it is not close. He pulls off the role of an aging batman extremely well. Also, Zack Snyder's vision of batman is legit. I have always hated batman up until this adaptation of him. Instead of being a conflicted and idealistic batman, this batman is dark, gritty, and 100% a badass. His equipment is decked out with machine guns and he has no aversion to killing people. In fact, he probably kills about 50 criminal by the time this movie is over. The warehouse scene is the coolest batman scene in any movie.2.) The development of a grudge between batman and superman is pulled off flawlessly. It actually makes sense why batman dislikes superman. Then, when they do fight it is about the coolest thing you can expect to see from a superhero film. 3.) I disagree with a lot of people about Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor. In my opinion, he played his role to perfection. 4.) B v S sets up Wonder Woman and Justice League with Gal Gadot's cameo as Wonder Woman and short clips of Aquaman, the Flash, and Cyborg. B v S is one of my favorite superhero films and rewatching it never gets old."

"The theatrical cut of this film is garbage which is why I rated it eight stars instead of nine. The first time I watched this film I didn't like it (not straight out hate but didn't like). Character motivations didn't make any sense, Lex was annoying as s***, editing was sloppy, and it was overly dark and broody for an action superhero movie. A year + a half, five Marvel films, a ton of bad reviews and a Justice League later a thought popped into my head: \"what if I watched BVS again\". This time I didn't have trailers ruining the best moments, I only vaguely remembered the film, and I was conditioned to look at it negatively but something unexpected happened: I actually loved it. Superman was just a normal person that tried to make a difference cause he could that others imposed their own beliefs on. Lex Luthor was a genius that couldn't stand his powerlessness compared to Superman or more accurately a super being. As Alfred said \"The fever, the rage, the feeling of powerlessness that turns good men... cruel\" and you see the same thought process in Batman. Batman, just like Lex Luthor feels powerless in the midst of a god-being and just like Lex he attempts to destroy him so he can get his sense of power back but unlike Lex, Batman learns something. I what is one of the corniest lines of the movie Superman says, \"Martha\" when he knows he can't win against Batman in a late desperate attempt to save his mother. Not only does this name connect with Bruce Wayne but it also shows what really matters to a man of steel: it isn't power, it isn't fame or anything else, it is his Mother and on a broader scale it is people. Lex (who doesn't care about people at all) knows he doesn't have the power so he creates something from his blood and the remains of Zod: A Doomsday for Superman. Not only does this film have depth but it also doesn't always explain it to you which is rare in a blockbuster action superhero flick normally cater to semi-comic book fans and people that want to shove popcorn in their mouths. This film rewards you for really noticing the details while still having massive explosions. One of my favorites is how Lex has all of Batman's branded killed which is why he isn't afraid of the branding at the end or Grandma's Peach Tea as a way of scaring the s*** out of someone. Of course, this film isn't perfect and I do have personal dislikes. The Batman V Superman fight was slow and pretty boring especially after watching such an amazing fight in Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 2 (If you haven't watched the animated Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 1 and 2 you are sorely missing out on something fantastic). Also, the addition of Wonder Woman who pretty much steals a hacker thing, gives it back and then suits up and fights against a giant monster thing. Not to say I don't like Wonder Woman (She is one of my favorite Superheroes of all time who showed not only can woman kick a** but they also don't need to be ashamed of their sexuality or gender) but she wasn't really that helpful to the plot and just brought in to expand the universe which was well done through Lex's superhuman hunting files. Also, the post-apocalyptic scene that was just a dream could have been cut but nothing is perfect except movies like Citizen Kane which isn't a lot of fun to watch cause it is too perfect. So to summarize, the theatrical cut is bad, the ultimate cut is Amazing and the other cut is meh. Please give it a second chance because it deserves it and save a good director from losing grace because of something he didn't do."
"I really liked it, don't know what all the hate is about. I'm actually a Marvel fan from when I was 7 or so, but Superman and Batman together in 1 movie? Just great. And personally I like Ben Affleck even better than Christian Bale as Batman. So just watch and enjoy, I know I did!"

"That's right. We have been waiting for these two heroes to finally meet and fight against each other. This movie is so good in both plot and special effects.Henry Cavill and Ben Affleck have performed well in their acting stages. They are the best superhero actors and they have filmed their fighting scenes very well. The movie starts to show the conflict between the lives of the heroes and now they have blamed each other for it. This movie is amazing and sets up a good plot for Dawn Justice."

"Actually...I didn't know what to expect. When you see Wonder Woman, you know it will be off of Wonder Woman and off of a Wonder Woman story, but with Batman V Superman, I was like, \"hmmmm, so who is this about?\" It was pretty obvious that it would feature many characters, but I thought the introduction to Batman was amazing. Ben Affleck nailed the part, not only as Batman but also as Bruce Wayne. He is my Batman. Henry Cavill continued to be super as the Man of Steel. And he is my Super - Man. A dark story? Yes, without a doubt. Could it have had a few more jokes? Sure. But not all movies or stories need to have jokes when certain events are serious. I really hope people can see this review and take another look at the movie, because, I loved it. I really hope the ratings can go up, eventually. And P.S, this movie is the perfect set up to Justice League."

"This film is crucial to the extended universe that DC is trying to build, but it feels highly derivative of better stories and continues to demonstrate the misuse of the iconic characters mentioned in the title. Plus Jesse Eisenberg feels wildly mis-casted."

"I'll start by making it clear I have only ever seen the Ultimate Edition. I'm aware of what was cut out for the theatrical release, so I will concede up front that most of the criticisms about pacing, editing, and missing bits of plot at release were merited.With that caveat out of the way, I must reiterate that this was bar-none the boldest superhero movie I have ever seen. To me, it was arguably the best as well, though \"best\" shouldn't be taken to mean \"most enjoyable.\" That honor easily goes to \"Thor: Ragnarok.\" What makes BvS stand out among other films in the genre is that it takes two characters who have been done to death since the 1970s and brings them up to date. I recently tried to watch \"Superman: The Movie\" for the first time in a number of years, and while it was still good and Reeves will always be iconic, I just couldn't take it seriously. I'll put it this way: If the story in BvS was \"stupid\" in your view but Superman turning back time by spinning the earth backward on its axis didn't seem like one of the dumbest things you have ever seen -in any movie from any genre- to the extent that it outright ruins the movie for you, then your opinion about BvS isn't worth much. Nostalgic bias was always going to be a problem for this movie, and the way people reacted to and reviewed \"Man of Steel\" was telling in this regard.That brings me to Zack Snyder's take on Superman. You know, that guy whose status as the first extraterrestrial ever encountered by humanity was a total non-issue in the old movies. Apparently, Snyder has a similar view to my own in that his take on the Man of Steel makes his being an alien a core piece of his identity. He may look like any other (absurdly attractive) person, but he knows what he is, and that makes him perpetually uncertain of where he fits in this world. He is essentially good and really does care about people, but he struggles to truly empathize with the likes of us. To be human is to be frail, and that is not something he can easily relate to. This is the root of his conflict with Batman.Just as Clark struggles to genuinely relate to most people, Snyder's Batman either refuses to or otherwise just can't relate to Superman. He doesn't see him as anything but a threat regardless of Superman's clear good intentions. Remember, a small group of Kryptonians were able to bring humanity to the brink of extinction in less than a day, and Bruce Wayne is nothing if not a realist. He didn't know the guy from Kansas. He only knew the god from another world.While Batman's anger toward and fear of Superman are readily apparent from the start, Superman's inability to imagine things from Bruce Wayne's perspective only becomes truly apparent during their first real interaction. This reminded me of the animated version of the \"world's finest\" storyline, where Superman judges Batman harshly for using fear tactics and threats of violence (also, actual violence) to get the job done. Superman wasn't willing to consider what it would take for a human man to fight criminals and save innocents, or what that life would do to him over time. Just as Batman didn't see the guy from Kansas, Superman didn't see the man who lives his life trapped in one brutal, unthinkably traumatic moment (this was beautifully conveyed during the film's opening moments), and had spent his whole adult life bearing witness to humanity at its absolute worst.The conflict between these two characters is as old as human history. They want the same things, but they can't understand one another. So they fight. And what a fight it was.Watching a fight between, say, Captain America and Iron Man was, to me, more frustrating than anything because each understood the other's perspective perfectly. The fight between Batman and Superman in BvS was genuinely gut-wrenching, as intended, because they would have understood one another if either had tried. The whole sequence hilighted Batman's tactical prowess and ability to control a situation. Maybe the most badass thing about the fight was that it ended exactly where Batman planned. That brings me to the big elephant in the room named \"Martha.\"I can't recall exactly which YouTuber put it this way, but if you thought the \"save Martha\" exchange was about their mothers having the same name, you had your brain turned off. The brain-on people have explained this to death, but it bears repeating. This was the moment when Superman became humanized to Batman. He was about to die, and his only concern was for his adoptive human mother. He still believed that the man about to take his life would do the right thing. Even with the cowl on, there was no mistaking the look on Batman's face. It was the look of shame, guilt, and sudden uncertainty that says \"What am I doing?\" Turns out even the most brutal, angry version of Bruce Wayne is better than Tony Stark at knowing right from wrong. At knowing that he had gone too far.From there, the third act was a series of truly impressive (albeit mostly CGI) fight sequences, beginning with what I regard as the undisputed champion of Batman fights. Nothing in the Nolan movies (and especially nothing in the Burton movies) even came close. Go ahead, try to convince yourself that Batman and Bane taking turns punching one another in the face until Bane's mask broke was a good fight sequence. No, this was a fight straight out of \"Arkham Knight,\" and it was glorious. The battle against Doomsday really was one for the books. From the moment Wonder Woman arrived accompanied by the intense sounds of Tina Guo's electric cello to Superman's tragic, heroic death at the hands of Doomsday, I was glued to the screen. Sure, the mere presence of Doomsday spoiled the end to a degree, but watching the Man of Steel laboring to carry that kryptonite spear towards certain death was no less impactful. A brief word on Jesse Eisenberg's take on Lex Luthor. At least one other reviewer on this site already said it best when they pointed out that this was his origin story. If you consider his scheme objectively, he is actually one of the more formidable incarnations of the character. If we're lucky, we'll eventually get to see a Snyder Cut of \"Justice League\" and find out where this story was actually meant to go. For the record, Joss Whedon and Danny Elfman both should have said \"no\" to taking a dump on someone else's art."
"BATMAN V SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE brings a fantastic surprise to a smash-hit team-up with one of the worlds most beloved DC Comics' icons of all time. The movie delivers spectacular casting, and fantastic acting with different characters having their shine in each scenes.The story follows Clark Kent/Superman who becomes a threat, after the destruction in Metropolis in Man Of Steel.(2013). Batman/Bruce Wayne sees him as a threat and begins his war on Superman.The movie brings spectacular storytelling, it tells the complications of human against alien who are on the same side, and the first meeting of Batman and Superman. The story of Bruce Wayne, with his many years of The Caped Crusader, sends him on a spiral of \"out of control\", sheer anger, and builds tension to wanting to defeat the Man of Steel. Snyder has fantastically gave this storytelling an exciting nod to the comics.Lex Luthor, played by Jesse Einsberg, delivers a very interesting performance, but very differently by him showing is his \"origin\" before he becomes a bald foe to the Man of Steel. He shows that his love of \"god vs man\" terrorises mankind when he ultimately creates Doomsday, and Batman realises Superman's inner heroism.It packs so many great \"out of nowhere\" excitement, including a first-look of the fearful Wonder Woman a.k.a. Diana Prince, played by Gal Gadot, and a fresh-new glimpse of the superhero DC canon: The Justice League.WATCH THIS MOVIE! The critics are out of their mind. It's a fun-packed action adventure which still keeps the movie enjoyable until it's final minutes of the movie. It's a FANTASTIC MOVIE! BEN AFFLECK AS BATMAN... is Incredible!A 10/10 overall!"
"I want to go on record as saying that this is a truly thrilling cinematic experience in so many ways. If pressed, I guess I could acknowledge that there were a couple ... let's say \"clumsy\" moments. And in a film that runs to three hours, that hardly seems like a significant issue, certainly not enough to rate it with fewer than 9 stars.This film has everything. There is dramatic tension right from the start. There is a magnificent story arc that picks up quite seamlessly from 'Man of Steel' and propels the viewer not only into the life of Clark Kent/Superman but also of Bruce Wayne/Batman.The villain is no mere cartoon of a villain; he is truly thoroughly (and apparently irrevocably) diabolical. He is a psychopath, and you wish for his death over and over and over. You want Superman to reduce him to ash with the power of his eyes.I have read a number of viewers' reviews, and it seems that the people who disliked the film / gave it a low rating had rather unfair and unrealistic expectations of it. That is, their own prejudices about how the plot could/should unfold or what the character development could/should be, etc. ruined the film for them. And that is a shame.My thought is: I settle into my seat, wait for the lights to dim, and then I wait to be transported by the film. I accept it, lock, stock, and barrel.As another reviewer remarked, I love how the film begins from the point of view of Bruce Wayne as he is among people on the ground who have fallen victim to the attack of Zod and the other Kryptonians.Why would Bruce Wayne not like Superman? Why would the good people of Earth hurl insults at Superman and burn him in effigy (on the news)? Because the good people of Earth just got catapulted into a new reality in which there are not only extraterrestrial beings (surprise!) but they are also superman! And a group of them are hell-bent on destroying humankind and taking the planet for themselves.It is difficult to see Superman as separate from the whole Kryptonian Krew.It seems that many moviegoers forgot that Bruce Wayne is also human. Sure, he's a hero, but he is flawed.. Just like the rest of us. He is a vigilante, after all.He has let his vigilantism get the better of him. HE is actually the one working outside the boundaries of the law, not Superman. It is the clear head of Alfred that shows us that he has gone into a rather dark place, that he has not seen what is really going on (in Luthor's scheme), and so he chooses to embark on his own scheme scheme to take out the alien invader. He is (allegedly) thinking of the future: if he wipes out the all-powerful alien, then it can't turn on humankind in the future. At least, he convinces himself of that.A philosophical question is raised in the film: should Clark Kent have remained a simple man from Kansas and never have become the Superman? Should he just let people die and let calamities happen? The question is answered for us in the character of Diana Prince/Wonder Woman. She withdrew from mankind (her exact words) and just sat around watching. Watching while people died horrible deaths all around her. So, should Superman have done the same? Do these special beings, these 'metahumans', have some kind of moral imperative to intervene, or should they be allowed to be regular people, too? It seems that humans want it both ways.It seems that humans are saying: \"Don't be a superalien ... except when I and my friends and family are in trouble. Then come save us.\""

"Batman v Superman: Ultimate Edition: If your looking for a quick, cheap thrill then you might not enjoy this film at the time. This movies theatrical version was butchered by WB and in doing so reshaped the story leaving numerous plot holes. So the Ultimate Edition is the full story and the one worth seeing. Watch 'Man of Steel' before seeing this movie. There is much to claw through here, so much so that the audience might easily find themselves exhausted from the overall aggression of the film. However, a lot of the story does work. The action is good, and the emotion feels real most of the time.This film is about Superman trying to become Superman. Trying to help the world, save people, find a place in this world not as an outcast, and yet is looked at has a threat by many. Superman is not from this world, yet He is trying to be human, find a place in this world, be excepted by earths people, and come into his destiny.This film is also about Batman being Batman for 20 years and losing faith in humanity, and fearing Superman, what Superman can do with his powers. Great film, great plot, great visuals. ---Yidioo"
"I didn't see the film in the theaters and just bought the \"Extended Edition \" on Amazon. I never properly saw Man of Steel- i think I rented it and watched it when already exhausted and fell asleep. I saw the mediocre user reviews and horrible reviews from critics of this film.They really have it wrong. This is the very best either Batman or Superman. It has a different take, on things. Much darker then earlier films even darker then the Christopher Nolan Batman films.First of all Christopher Nolan is an Executive Producer. So how bad could it be? I loved Sucker Punch and Zack Snyder was involved with that. So how bad could this be? Hans Zimmer did the music, so how bad could it be?I remember watching the old Superman TV shows and reading the Superman and Batman comics as a little kid and loved them, but i wouldn't call myself a \"fan boy\" of comic universes, like so many younger people today. As an older adult I will admit my favorite TV show of all time was Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but watched it on DVD only after it had finished. I saw the second of the Dark Knight series in the theater, but the other two, I watched on DVD. They were great, but not my favorite films like so many people. i also loved the first couple Superman and Batman films in the older series. Regardless, i was not waiting with baited breath to see Man of Steel or this one.I'm more of a serious film fan, who can watch Stanley Kubrick films over and over and my favorite films in the last twenty years, are Eyes Wide Shut and Intersteller, both of which i've watched multiple times.So, with that said, take it from me, the critics have this film very wrong, just as critics hated 2001: A Space Odyssey when it first came out. This film will have lasting appreciation.Surprised how much I liked Ben Afleck's Batman. it was hard to get into Henry Cavil's scrawnier looking Superman, but it grew on me. Amy Adams was great as Lois Lane, The Gal Gadol Wonder Women was amazing. Lex Luther was terrific, like Nolan's Joker. Jeremy Irons was the best Alfred ever. Holly Hunter and Diane Lane was good too. The movie had bad reviews but made a billion dollars. Hopefully everyone buys the Ultimate Edition and it breaks sales records and the film is re-appreciated. I have no idea what scenes this Ultimate Edition added, but it is pretty perfect. Now I can't wait for Wonder Woman and the Justice League and as soon as I finish writing this am going to watch Man of Steal. I'm into it now!I can only surmise that the bad reviews stem from too much expectations of the rigid fan boy types and the radical changes in tone, we see in this film.Total masterpiece of cinema, but I have a few criticisms. There are a few hollow scenes of typical Idiot cops and authorities getting everything wrong in a cliché type way and it has a few filler scenes of that type and a few moments here and there that felt rushed and cheesy. Maybe not everything restored into the Ultimate Edition should have been. I wish there had been more Kevin Costner scenes."

"The whole entire Batman V Superman movie was great and yes even though it felt slow to the majority of the people who watched it but to me I enjoyed every part and every scene of Batman V Superman and when it got to the fight scenes both batman VS Superman and the Doomsday fight it brought so much drama, intensity, and epic performances. So with that being said I give this movie a good 10/10 because it really did go to my expectations and it brought a powerful performance and a powerful yet epic introduction to the upcoming Justice League."

"When I first wrote a review for this movie a year ago exclaiming my excitement for the film, I had been high off a fresh dose of live-action DC superheroes playing out the beloved comic book stories that I had grown up on. It was all playing out before my eyes and coming to life. After a few months had passed, I began to notice things about the movie that I disliked: little gaps in the story, things that didn't add up, etc. My original rating of a 10 / 10 dropped to an 8 /10. But today it has gone back up to a 10. The extended version of the film not only rectifies the gaps but also silences critics.Many claimed that the movie was too dark or that it just didn't make sense. To those people, I say: \"Pick up a comic book!\" Many of the critics of this particular film were part of the superhero bandwagon that formed when Marvel began its spree of Avengers-related films. In fact, its estimated that over 60% of people who go to see 'superhero' genre films have never picked up a comic book in their life. I would argue that similar numbers could figure to those which view the CW televised DC Universe shows. People complain that DC comics is just too dark but the fact is that these movies are based upon actual comics which are meant to be dark (ex: The Dark Knight Returns, Injustice, etc.). Its like complaining that Game of Thrones (the TV series) sucks because they kill off too many characters. Read the books! Its frustrating to see such a beautiful work of art like Batman V Superman criticized by those ignorant to its universe and its meaning. This movie is in fact a catalyst that opens numerous doorways and leaves true fans in awe of the possibilities for future movies. But regardless of whether or not people choose to educate themselves, this film's DVD/Blu-ray extended version puts the theater release to shame. All of the plot holes and gaps are filled in 30 minutes of extended footage scattered throughout the film. The movie ultimately becomes more complete and people will wish that the movie had shown the full 3 hours of footage in its theatrical debut. As a major DC comics fan, I will of course pick up on things that a comics fan would not, but someone who does not read comics would learn to appreciate this film in its entirety with the extended version. Get your hands on a copy today or find it on Netflix or the internet somewhere!"

"I ignored the bad reviews and watched anyways. This film had a lot to live up to after Civil War was released and I went into this film expecting the worst. It ended up to be the best Superhero film of 2016 to me. One complaint was that this film was more concerned about universe building than telling a great story than Civil War but for me it was the other way around; Civil War felt like a build up to something else and to be honest, I felt that way when I saw the other MCU films. Batman vs Superman however not only had a great story, but it also felt a lot more consistent than Civil War. This film was way more diverse with the cast than the MCU but unlike the MCU, I felt like this film doesn't go overboard with the SJW stuff like the MCU films or The Star Wars Sequel films do. The Visuals were AMAZING, The Score by Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL was AMAZING as well, The Tone is just right as I actually felt for the characters emotionally, The Cinematography kept my eyes glued to the screen, and the script felt really Intelligent and Complex and despite people calling the writing confusing, I was able to piece it together with no problem whatsoever. This film is similar to Empire Strikes back in terms of popularity so over time after the other movies are released, this movie would probably be more popular.This film was way better than I Expected and deserves another chance.

"Its shame to see what critics and marvel fans did to this movie and targeted Zack Snyder for it. I have seen this movie more than 25 times till date. And i enjoy this movie as much as i enjoyed the first time. The fans who have read DC comics, wouldn't be disappointed in this movie. Its dark movie, yes it is. Because the title shows the intense situation at hand. Two superheroes about to rip each other apart for whatever reasons that brought them to this stage. Yes it had to be dark and intense.Only marvel can be stupid enough to show an alien invasion where humans are loosing the battle and the super heroes are cracking jokes while battles as if they are playing ping pong. a person playing Call of Duty game is more serious while playing than the marvel heroes fighting aliens."

"Last week some news came out from somebody online who had claimed to have seen a finished version of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. If you were like me, you've been leery of checking it out because you weren't sure how much might actually be true. Now Zack Snyder has spoken out about the spoiler-filled post, although his response doesn't really clear anything up.In a word, to MTV, he called the post \"hilarious,which might imply that he's saying that it's mostly, if not entirely, untrue. That might be the case, but then again he could have just said it was untrue and he didn't say that. What he did say, however, is that he doesn't like spoilers. While this may seem odd for the director who's most recent trailer appeared to give away the entire movie, Snyder says that's not the case. Even if you've seen the trailer, you can rest easy, as there is much more we have not seen in then finished film. Says Snyder I have the benefit of seeing the movie. It's cool that think it's too much, and I appreciate people not wanting to know, but there's plenty that they don't know. There's a lot of movie that's not in the trailer. In the process of calling the Batman v Superman Reddit review hilarious, Snyder goes on to talk about how he hates it when spoilers come out. The director would much rather that fans see the movie mostly blind. While he understands that some fans may wish to find the answers before hand, he wants his movies to be mysteries going in. If you're, as an audience member, exploring these articles, looking for answers to questions that you have, maybe you're okay with knowing before you go. It's like an individual taste. But like I said, I want people to see the movie without knowing.Spoilers are a topic that mean different things to different people. While most try to avoid them to some degree, the need to solve the mystery is a nearly universal human experience. We have an inclination to want to know the truth, even while also wanting to be surprised. For most of us getting some information is good, but getting all the information is bad, of course, only getting the details that you want can be difficult."
"The theatrical is choppy, poorly edited, hard to follow, with some really good moments mixed in their. The extended is much more fluent and is much easier to follow, it does have a long runtime, which might make it seem a bit dragging on, but if you like long films done right, like Lord of the Rings, you will like this movie as long as you get into the characters and story. Speaking of which, the story starts out perfectly showing Bruce Wayne as a character, and it is very powerful. There are several moments in this movie that are powerful, emotional, and shocking. Characters. Batman is my favorite fictional character of all time, and believe me when I say, Ben Affleck as Batman was perfect, he had the charisma, the anger, and the look of being through some bad stuff Gal Gadot also does perfect as Wonder Woman, but if you want to really see how good she does, go watch the Wonder Woman movie. Henry Call as Superman. I really don't like it when people say Christopher Reeves is better. Don't get me wrong, Reeves does great, but can you imagine him as Superman in this movie? I wouldn't like it. It would be like Adam West playing Batman in The Dark Knight. Henry Cavill does great in this role, I can say everything about him as I said with Ben Affleck. Jesse Eisenberg as Luthor. I thought it was different in a good way. I've heard a criticism for him as being too much like Joker, but is that a bad thing? Joker is my favorite villain, so to see Superman have an enemy that crazy, but still hold the values Luthor needs to be Luthor, I think it is great. The thing I thought this movie was lacking in the first and second acts was humor, at least good humor. If there was more humor, I would've given this movie a ten because it would give a more relaxing feel to the parts that needed it. All in all though, this movie was awesome, it had powerful moments, it was badass, and just plain fun. It had a great story arc and does its job very well."

"*I will be talking about the Ultimate Edition of the film* This was one of the most anticipated CBM of all time. Ever since the arrival and subsequent success of Marvel's The Avengers people have wondered when will DC launch its own cinematic universe, one of the main reasons being the opportunity to finally see titans such as Batman and Superman share the screen together: the ultimate nerd dream. On 2016, the moment finally came for BvS to be released AND.. it performed poorly. Not only did critical reception left a lot to be desired, but fan reactions where surprisingly split after its cinematic debut. People either loved it and called Zack a genius, or hated it and called him a hack. Me, personally, I found myself with middle of the road feelings, for sure, but more leaning towards the negative side with subsequent viewings. The theatrical cut of the film showcased amazing performances, incredible visuals, and action set pieces that seemed like comic book panels come to life, in a good way. However, when it comes to its narrative structure and more technical aspects like editing, the film was seriously flawed. More plot holes than Age of Ultron, questionable character decisions, random editing that lacked cohesion and focus, and forced dramatic moments that lacked any impact because the attempts at character development ranged from limited to nonexistent, especially when it comes to Superman's character. I thought it was a 5/10 movie at best. As such, I was kind of skeptical about the idea of a 30 minute longer version. I say kind of because I know how Zack works. I remember Watchmen being vastly improved with its director's cut, so in a way I was expecting BvS to perform in a similar manner, but I also feared those 30 minutes wold be just there to amplify action and discredit storytelling issues. Oh boy, I'm so glad I was proved wrong. The ultimate cut of the film was infuriating, but not because it was awful, but because it questions the sanity of WB executives and editors and makes you wonder what were they thinking during the editing process. What I got out of the Ultimate Edition was a thought-provoking deconstruction of two very iconic superheroes that gave spotlight to the struggles both of them face when they aren't fighting crime. What I got was an extremely well produced character study on both Batman and Superman in a cynical world, a world dangerously close to our own. We meet Batman as a ruthless, worn out hero that has seen the failure behind his ideals and witnessed some truly horrifying things in his life. Superman, on the other hand, is portrayed as a godlike figure that seeks to do good in the world, but finds himself emotionally conflicted once he realized that every good deed he does leaves behind a trail of destruction (most of it due to Luthor's antics). In my opinion, this is a hugely original approach, one that distances itself from the rest of the competition and delivers a dark, somber, yet relevant superhero movie that understands both characters and gives them real human struggles to deal with. I felt invested in both of them, and hoped that by the end of the film both could find a way to redeem themselves. Their character arcs were very well established during the first two acts of the movie, and by the time we get to the titular climactic battle the emotion behind the jaw-dropping action is intensified. Lex Luthor as a villain was also given more time to develop with this new edition. One of the main criticisms with the original version was the fact that his plan relied too much on conveniences, and the character's mannerisms and mad-scientist attitude was annoying, and that goes without saying his motivations were unclear. Not only do we spend more time understanding his hate for any godlike figure and thus his hatred for Superman, but the added scenes allowed us to witness his entire plan come to fruition. It sells the cold, manipulative, calculating attributes of his comic counterpart. The acting is spot on. Every actor owns his/her role, from Cavill's Superman, to Ben Affleck as Batman, Eisenberg as Luthor, and Gadot as Wonder Woman, whose scenes are brief, but are more than enough to sell the strong and ferocious warrior that she is. Cinematography is stunning, and miles above that of Man of Steel's. And the soundtrack by Zimmer and Junkie XL? Perfect, just perfect. When it comes to flaws, the film still has some of those. The Martha moment, while serving as a pivotal character moment for Batman, felt off in execution, and its understandable that many people got mad at it. If your main complaint about BvS the first time around was its bleak tone and subject matter, this film is still not for you. I understand most were expecting to see the heroes being the most iconic versions of themselves, clashing in an elongated battle and evoking the same feelings The Avengers gave audiences back in 2012. In that sense, the film will remain divisive, but at least I have the comfort of saying that, at the very least, the film is competently made."

"This film was amazing. Ben Affleck was easily the best part of this movie, he brought his a-game as Batman. The chemistry between Affleck & Irons was outstanding. Gal Gadot did a great job as Wonder Woman. The fight between Batman & Superman was awesome. The final fight with Doomsday was outstanding in every way possible. However, there is only one problem with this film and that's Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor. He was sadly missed cast in this role, but then again it's really the fault of Warner Bros. Studios. Overall, this film deliver on almost every level. I highly recommend that you watch the extended version of this film."

"I know I know. I saw it in theaters too, and felt like it could've been so much better. While the Batman element was good, the narrative felt fractured, and the third act was just one long stunt scene. Superman was relegated to a supporting character, and other characters didn't get a chance to shine. And then I chanced on the ultimate cut. Calling it 30 mins of \"extra\" footage is unfair to Zack Snyder because it's exactly these 30 mins that makes the movie a worthy one. What I can say about the theatrical cut is this - It had the blockbuster elements - music, visuals, stunts, CGI. But, it lacked the human elements. The first 20 mins of the movie had it, but not after that. The extended cut in comparison has a flow to the narrative. There are no disjointed scenes, everything flows smoothly, and there's connective tissue. Superman gets to spend some time with his father, and mother. Clark Kent does some investigative journalism. Superman helps the people after the blast. Lois Lane doesn't jump to conclusions, she gets to the bottom of the crime. Lex Luthor apparently had a coherent plan - everything is explained pretty well. Wonder Woman was already good, so there's no change there :) Also, the \"Martha\" scene seems better executed, because it is a few seconds longer, and there's time to breathe it in. So, here's my take on this movie - The theatrical cut was junk. Get the Bluray for ultimate edition, and you shall not be disappointed. I've seen it so many more times now, and it's the definitive cut. It is the movie we deserve. It's a unique take on Batman, and Superman. It's a gritty take on the superhero movie genre, and definitely the best DCEU movie, and the best DC movie since The Dark Knight.P.S. Yes it's dark. We're adults, and we should appreciate mature film making without intentionally silly moments. It attempts to be philosophical, and something deep instead of just trying to make you chuckle."

"This is one of the best superhero movies ever made. Zack Snyder is a magician behind the camera.The reason behind so many complaints is the fact that Warner Bros. marketed this movie as a fight between Batman and Superman. That's not what it is. It's a movie about the origins of the Justice League.The cinematography, the acting and the score are all second to none. This film is phenomenal.P.S: watch the 3 hour extended cut that Snyder intended you to see, not the 2 and a half hour movie that Warner Bros. decided would be better for theaters."

"I don't care what the critics say, this is a very well-done movie. I'll start my review by listing what I like about the movie.1.) Ben Affleck is the best batman to me and it is not close. He pulls off the role of an aging batman extremely well. Also, Zack Snyder's vision of batman is legit. I have always hated batman up until this adaptation of him. Instead of being a conflicted and idealistic batman, this batman is dark, gritty, and 100% a badass. His equipment is decked out with machine guns and he has no aversion to killing people. In fact, he probably kills about 50 criminal by the time this movie is over. The warehouse scene is the coolest batman scene in any movie.2.) The development of a grudge between batman and superman is pulled off flawlessly. It actually makes sense why batman dislikes superman. Then, when they do fight it is about the coolest thing you can expect to see from a superhero film. 3.) I disagree with a lot of people about Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor. In my opinion, he played his role to perfection. 4.) B v S sets up Wonder Woman and Justice League with Gal Gadot's cameo as Wonder Woman and short clips of Aquaman, the Flash, and Cyborg. B v S is one of my favorite superhero films and rewatching it never gets old."

"The theatrical cut of this film is garbage which is why I rated it eight stars instead of nine. The first time I watched this film I didn't like it (not straight out hate but didn't like). Character motivations didn't make any sense, Lex was annoying as s***, editing was sloppy, and it was overly dark and broody for an action superhero movie. A year + a half, five Marvel films, a ton of bad reviews and a Justice League later a thought popped into my head: \"what if I watched BVS again\". This time I didn't have trailers ruining the best moments, I only vaguely remembered the film, and I was conditioned to look at it negatively but something unexpected happened: I actually loved it. Superman was just a normal person that tried to make a difference cause he could that others imposed their own beliefs on. Lex Luthor was a genius that couldn't stand his powerlessness compared to Superman or more accurately a super being. As Alfred said \"The fever, the rage, the feeling of powerlessness that turns good men... cruel\" and you see the same thought process in Batman. Batman, just like Lex Luthor feels powerless in the midst of a god-being and just like Lex he attempts to destroy him so he can get his sense of power back but unlike Lex, Batman learns something. I what is one of the corniest lines of the movie Superman says, \"Martha\" when he knows he can't win against Batman in a late desperate attempt to save his mother. Not only does this name connect with Bruce Wayne but it also shows what really matters to a man of steel: it isn't power, it isn't fame or anything else, it is his Mother and on a broader scale it is people. Lex (who doesn't care about people at all) knows he doesn't have the power so he creates something from his blood and the remains of Zod: A Doomsday for Superman. Not only does this film have depth but it also doesn't always explain it to you which is rare in a blockbuster action superhero flick normally cater to semi-comic book fans and people that want to shove popcorn in their mouths. This film rewards you for really noticing the details while still having massive explosions. One of my favorites is how Lex has all of Batman's branded killed which is why he isn't afraid of the branding at the end or Grandma's Peach Tea as a way of scaring the s*** out of someone. Of course, this film isn't perfect and I do have personal dislikes. The Batman V Superman fight was slow and pretty boring especially after watching such an amazing fight in Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 2 (If you haven't watched the animated Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 1 and 2 you are sorely missing out on something fantastic). Also, the addition of Wonder Woman who pretty much steals a hacker thing, gives it back and then suits up and fights against a giant monster thing. Not to say I don't like Wonder Woman (She is one of my favorite Superheroes of all time who showed not only can woman kick a** but they also don't need to be ashamed of their sexuality or gender) but she wasn't really that helpful to the plot and just brought in to expand the universe which was well done through Lex's superhuman hunting files. Also, the post-apocalyptic scene that was just a dream could have been cut but nothing is perfect except movies like Citizen Kane which isn't a lot of fun to watch cause it is too perfect. So to summarize, the theatrical cut is bad, the ultimate cut is Amazing and the other cut is meh. Please give it a second chance because it deserves it and save a good director from losing grace because of something he didn't do."
"I really liked it, don't know what all the hate is about. I'm actually a Marvel fan from when I was 7 or so, but Superman and Batman together in 1 movie? Just great. And personally I like Ben Affleck even better than Christian Bale as Batman. So just watch and enjoy, I know I did!"

"That's right. We have been waiting for these two heroes to finally meet and fight against each other. This movie is so good in both plot and special effects.Henry Cavill and Ben Affleck have performed well in their acting stages. They are the best superhero actors and they have filmed their fighting scenes very well. The movie starts to show the conflict between the lives of the heroes and now they have blamed each other for it. This movie is amazing and sets up a good plot for Dawn Justice."

"Actually...I didn't know what to expect. When you see Wonder Woman, you know it will be off of Wonder Woman and off of a Wonder Woman story, but with Batman V Superman, I was like, \"hmmmm, so who is this about?\" It was pretty obvious that it would feature many characters, but I thought the introduction to Batman was amazing. Ben Affleck nailed the part, not only as Batman but also as Bruce Wayne. He is my Batman. Henry Cavill continued to be super as the Man of Steel. And he is my Super - Man. A dark story? Yes, without a doubt. Could it have had a few more jokes? Sure. But not all movies or stories need to have jokes when certain events are serious. I really hope people can see this review and take another look at the movie, because, I loved it. I really hope the ratings can go up, eventually. And P.S, this movie is the perfect set up to Justice League."

"I'll start by making it clear I have only ever seen the Ultimate Edition. I'm aware of what was cut out for the theatrical release, so I will concede up front that most of the criticisms about pacing, editing, and missing bits of plot at release were merited.With that caveat out of the way, I must reiterate that this was bar-none the boldest superhero movie I have ever seen. To me, it was arguably the best as well, though \"best\" shouldn't be taken to mean \"most enjoyable.\" That honor easily goes to \"Thor: Ragnarok.\" What makes BvS stand out among other films in the genre is that it takes two characters who have been done to death since the 1970s and brings them up to date. I recently tried to watch \"Superman: The Movie\" for the first time in a number of years, and while it was still good and Reeves will always be iconic, I just couldn't take it seriously. I'll put it this way: If the story in BvS was \"stupid\" in your view but Superman turning back time by spinning the earth backward on its axis didn't seem like one of the dumbest things you have ever seen -in any movie from any genre- to the extent that it outright ruins the movie for you, then your opinion about BvS isn't worth much. Nostalgic bias was always going to be a problem for this movie, and the way people reacted to and reviewed \"Man of Steel\" was telling in this regard.That brings me to Zack Snyder's take on Superman. You know, that guy whose status as the first extraterrestrial ever encountered by humanity was a total non-issue in the old movies. Apparently, Snyder has a similar view to my own in that his take on the Man of Steel makes his being an alien a core piece of his identity. He may look like any other (absurdly attractive) person, but he knows what he is, and that makes him perpetually uncertain of where he fits in this world. He is essentially good and really does care about people, but he struggles to truly empathize with the likes of us. To be human is to be frail, and that is not something he can easily relate to. This is the root of his conflict with Batman.Just as Clark struggles to genuinely relate to most people, Snyder's Batman either refuses to or otherwise just can't relate to Superman. He doesn't see him as anything but a threat regardless of Superman's clear good intentions. Remember, a small group of Kryptonians were able to bring humanity to the brink of extinction in less than a day, and Bruce Wayne is nothing if not a realist. He didn't know the guy from Kansas. He only knew the god from another world.While Batman's anger toward and fear of Superman are readily apparent from the start, Superman's inability to imagine things from Bruce Wayne's perspective only becomes truly apparent during their first real interaction. This reminded me of the animated version of the \"world's finest\" storyline, where Superman judges Batman harshly for using fear tactics and threats of violence (also, actual violence) to get the job done. Superman wasn't willing to consider what it would take for a human man to fight criminals and save innocents, or what that life would do to him over time. Just as Batman didn't see the guy from Kansas, Superman didn't see the man who lives his life trapped in one brutal, unthinkably traumatic moment (this was beautifully conveyed during the film's opening moments), and had spent his whole adult life bearing witness to humanity at its absolute worst.The conflict between these two characters is as old as human history. They want the same things, but they can't understand one another. So they fight. And what a fight it was.Watching a fight between, say, Captain America and Iron Man was, to me, more frustrating than anything because each understood the other's perspective perfectly. The fight between Batman and Superman in BvS was genuinely gut-wrenching, as intended, because they would have understood one another if either had tried. The whole sequence hilighted Batman's tactical prowess and ability to control a situation. Maybe the most badass thing about the fight was that it ended exactly where Batman planned. That brings me to the big elephant in the room named \"Martha.\"I can't recall exactly which YouTuber put it this way, but if you thought the \"save Martha\" exchange was about their mothers having the same name, you had your brain turned off. The brain-on people have explained this to death, but it bears repeating. This was the moment when Superman became humanized to Batman. He was about to die, and his only concern was for his adoptive human mother. He still believed that the man about to take his life would do the right thing. Even with the cowl on, there was no mistaking the look on Batman's face. It was the look of shame, guilt, and sudden uncertainty that says \"What am I doing?\" Turns out even the most brutal, angry version of Bruce Wayne is better than Tony Stark at knowing right from wrong. At knowing that he had gone too far.From there, the third act was a series of truly impressive (albeit mostly CGI) fight sequences, beginning with what I regard as the undisputed champion of Batman fights. Nothing in the Nolan movies (and especially nothing in the Burton movies) even came close. Go ahead, try to convince yourself that Batman and Bane taking turns punching one another in the face until Bane's mask broke was a good fight sequence. No, this was a fight straight out of \"Arkham Knight,\" and it was glorious. The battle against Doomsday really was one for the books. From the moment Wonder Woman arrived accompanied by the intense sounds of Tina Guo's electric cello to Superman's tragic, heroic death at the hands of Doomsday, I was glued to the screen. Sure, the mere presence of Doomsday spoiled the end to a degree, but watching the Man of Steel laboring to carry that kryptonite spear towards certain death was no less impactful. A brief word on Jesse Eisenberg's take on Lex Luthor. At least one other reviewer on this site already said it best when they pointed out that this was his origin story. If you consider his scheme objectively, he is actually one of the more formidable incarnations of the character. If we're lucky, we'll eventually get to see a Snyder Cut of \"Justice League\" and find out where this story was actually meant to go. For the record, Joss Whedon and Danny Elfman both should have said \"no\" to taking a dump on someone else's art."
"BATMAN V SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE brings a fantastic surprise to a smash-hit team-up with one of the worlds most beloved DC Comics' icons of all time. The movie delivers spectacular casting, and fantastic acting with different characters having their shine in each scenes.The story follows Clark Kent/Superman who becomes a threat, after the destruction in Metropolis in Man Of Steel.(2013). Batman/Bruce Wayne sees him as a threat and begins his war on Superman.The movie brings spectacular storytelling, it tells the complications of human against alien who are on the same side, and the first meeting of Batman and Superman. The story of Bruce Wayne, with his many years of The Caped Crusader, sends him on a spiral of \"out of control\", sheer anger, and builds tension to wanting to defeat the Man of Steel. Snyder has fantastically gave this storytelling an exciting nod to the comics.Lex Luthor, played by Jesse Einsberg, delivers a very interesting performance, but very differently by him showing is his \"origin\" before he becomes a bald foe to the Man of Steel. He shows that his love of \"god vs man\" terrorises mankind when he ultimately creates Doomsday, and Batman realises Superman's inner heroism.It packs so many great \"out of nowhere\" excitement, including a first-look of the fearful Wonder Woman a.k.a. Diana Prince, played by Gal Gadot, and a fresh-new glimpse of the superhero DC canon: The Justice League.WATCH THIS MOVIE! The critics are out of their mind. It's a fun-packed action adventure which still keeps the movie enjoyable until it's final minutes of the movie. It's a FANTASTIC MOVIE! BEN AFFLECK AS BATMAN... is Incredible!A 10/10 overall!"
"I want to go on record as saying that this is a truly thrilling cinematic experience in so many ways. If pressed, I guess I could acknowledge that there were a couple ... let's say \"clumsy\" moments. And in a film that runs to three hours, that hardly seems like a significant issue, certainly not enough to rate it with fewer than 9 stars.This film has everything. There is dramatic tension right from the start. There is a magnificent story arc that picks up quite seamlessly from 'Man of Steel' and propels the viewer not only into the life of Clark Kent/Superman but also of Bruce Wayne/Batman.The villain is no mere cartoon of a villain; he is truly thoroughly (and apparently irrevocably) diabolical. He is a psychopath, and you wish for his death over and over and over. You want Superman to reduce him to ash with the power of his eyes.I have read a number of viewers' reviews, and it seems that the people who disliked the film / gave it a low rating had rather unfair and unrealistic expectations of it. That is, their own prejudices about how the plot could/should unfold or what the character development could/should be, etc. ruined the film for them. And that is a shame.My thought is: I settle into my seat, wait for the lights to dim, and then I wait to be transported by the film. I accept it, lock, stock, and barrel.As another reviewer remarked, I love how the film begins from the point of view of Bruce Wayne as he is among people on the ground who have fallen victim to the attack of Zod and the other Kryptonians.Why would Bruce Wayne not like Superman? Why would the good people of Earth hurl insults at Superman and burn him in effigy (on the news)? Because the good people of Earth just got catapulted into a new reality in which there are not only extraterrestrial beings (surprise!) but they are also superman! And a group of them are hell-bent on destroying humankind and taking the planet for themselves.It is difficult to see Superman as separate from the whole Kryptonian Krew.It seems that many moviegoers forgot that Bruce Wayne is also human. Sure, he's a hero, but he is flawed.. Just like the rest of us. He is a vigilante, after all.He has let his vigilantism get the better of him. HE is actually the one working outside the boundaries of the law, not Superman. It is the clear head of Alfred that shows us that he has gone into a rather dark place, that he has not seen what is really going on (in Luthor's scheme), and so he chooses to embark on his own scheme scheme to take out the alien invader. He is (allegedly) thinking of the future: if he wipes out the all-powerful alien, then it can't turn on humankind in the future. At least, he convinces himself of that.A philosophical question is raised in the film: should Clark Kent have remained a simple man from Kansas and never have become the Superman? Should he just let people die and let calamities happen? The question is answered for us in the character of Diana Prince/Wonder Woman. She withdrew from mankind (her exact words) and just sat around watching. Watching while people died horrible deaths all around her. So, should Superman have done the same? Do these special beings, these 'metahumans', have some kind of moral imperative to intervene, or should they be allowed to be regular people, too? It seems that humans want it both ways.It seems that humans are saying: \"Don't be a superalien ... except when I and my friends and family are in trouble. Then come save us.\""

"Batman v Superman: Ultimate Edition: If your looking for a quick, cheap thrill then you might not enjoy this film at the time. This movies theatrical version was butchered by WB and in doing so reshaped the story leaving numerous plot holes. So the Ultimate Edition is the full story and the one worth seeing. Watch 'Man of Steel' before seeing this movie. There is much to claw through here, so much so that the audience might easily find themselves exhausted from the overall aggression of the film. However, a lot of the story does work. The action is good, and the emotion feels real most of the time.This film is about Superman trying to become Superman. Trying to help the world, save people, find a place in this world not as an outcast, and yet is looked at has a threat by many. Superman is not from this world, yet He is trying to be human, find a place in this world, be excepted by earths people, and come into his destiny.This film is also about Batman being Batman for 20 years and losing faith in humanity, and fearing Superman, what Superman can do with his powers. Great film, great plot, great visuals. ---Yidioo"
"I didn't see the film in the theaters and just bought the \"Extended Edition \" on Amazon. I never properly saw Man of Steel- i think I rented it and watched it when already exhausted and fell asleep. I saw the mediocre user reviews and horrible reviews from critics of this film.They really have it wrong. This is the very best either Batman or Superman. It has a different take, on things. Much darker then earlier films even darker then the Christopher Nolan Batman films.First of all Christopher Nolan is an Executive Producer. So how bad could it be? I loved Sucker Punch and Zack Snyder was involved with that. So how bad could this be? Hans Zimmer did the music, so how bad could it be?I remember watching the old Superman TV shows and reading the Superman and Batman comics as a little kid and loved them, but i wouldn't call myself a \"fan boy\" of comic universes, like so many younger people today. As an older adult I will admit my favorite TV show of all time was Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but watched it on DVD only after it had finished. I saw the second of the Dark Knight series in the theater, but the other two, I watched on DVD. They were great, but not my favorite films like so many people. i also loved the first couple Superman and Batman films in the older series. Regardless, i was not waiting with baited breath to see Man of Steel or this one.I'm more of a serious film fan, who can watch Stanley Kubrick films over and over and my favorite films in the last twenty years, are Eyes Wide Shut and Intersteller, both of which i've watched multiple times.So, with that said, take it from me, the critics have this film very wrong, just as critics hated 2001: A Space Odyssey when it first came out. This film will have lasting appreciation.Surprised how much I liked Ben Afleck's Batman. it was hard to get into Henry Cavil's scrawnier looking Superman, but it grew on me. Amy Adams was great as Lois Lane, The Gal Gadol Wonder Women was amazing. Lex Luther was terrific, like Nolan's Joker. Jeremy Irons was the best Alfred ever. Holly Hunter and Diane Lane was good too. The movie had bad reviews but made a billion dollars. Hopefully everyone buys the Ultimate Edition and it breaks sales records and the film is re-appreciated. I have no idea what scenes this Ultimate Edition added, but it is pretty perfect. Now I can't wait for Wonder Woman and the Justice League and as soon as I finish writing this am going to watch Man of Steal. I'm into it now!I can only surmise that the bad reviews stem from too much expectations of the rigid fan boy types and the radical changes in tone, we see in this film.Total masterpiece of cinema, but I have a few criticisms. There are a few hollow scenes of typical Idiot cops and authorities getting everything wrong in a cliché type way and it has a few filler scenes of that type and a few moments here and there that felt rushed and cheesy. Maybe not everything restored into the Ultimate Edition should have been. I wish there had been more Kevin Costner scenes."

"The whole entire Batman V Superman movie was great and yes even though it felt slow to the majority of the people who watched it but to me I enjoyed every part and every scene of Batman V Superman and when it got to the fight scenes both batman VS Superman and the Doomsday fight it brought so much drama, intensity, and epic performances. So with that being said I give this movie a good 10/10 because it really did go to my expectations and it brought a powerful performance and a powerful yet epic introduction to the upcoming Justice League."

"When I first wrote a review for this movie a year ago exclaiming my excitement for the film, I had been high off a fresh dose of live-action DC superheroes playing out the beloved comic book stories that I had grown up on. It was all playing out before my eyes and coming to life. After a few months had passed, I began to notice things about the movie that I disliked: little gaps in the story, things that didn't add up, etc. My original rating of a 10 / 10 dropped to an 8 /10. But today it has gone back up to a 10. The extended version of the film not only rectifies the gaps but also silences critics.Many claimed that the movie was too dark or that it just didn't make sense. To those people, I say: \"Pick up a comic book!\" Many of the critics of this particular film were part of the superhero bandwagon that formed when Marvel began its spree of Avengers-related films. In fact, its estimated that over 60% of people who go to see 'superhero' genre films have never picked up a comic book in their life. I would argue that similar numbers could figure to those which view the CW televised DC Universe shows. People complain that DC comics is just too dark but the fact is that these movies are based upon actual comics which are meant to be dark (ex: The Dark Knight Returns, Injustice, etc.). Its like complaining that Game of Thrones (the TV series) sucks because they kill off too many characters. Read the books! Its frustrating to see such a beautiful work of art like Batman V Superman criticized by those ignorant to its universe and its meaning. This movie is in fact a catalyst that opens numerous doorways and leaves true fans in awe of the possibilities for future movies. But regardless of whether or not people choose to educate themselves, this film's DVD/Blu-ray extended version puts the theater release to shame. All of the plot holes and gaps are filled in 30 minutes of extended footage scattered throughout the film. The movie ultimately becomes more complete and people will wish that the movie had shown the full 3 hours of footage in its theatrical debut. As a major DC comics fan, I will of course pick up on things that a comics fan would not, but someone who does not read comics would learn to appreciate this film in its entirety with the extended version. Get your hands on a copy today or find it on Netflix or the internet somewhere!"

"I ignored the bad reviews and watched anyways. This film had a lot to live up to after Civil War was released and I went into this film expecting the worst. It ended up to be the best Superhero film of 2016 to me. One complaint was that this film was more concerned about universe building than telling a great story than Civil War but for me it was the other way around; Civil War felt like a build up to something else and to be honest, I felt that way when I saw the other MCU films. Batman vs Superman however not only had a great story, but it also felt a lot more consistent than Civil War. This film was way more diverse with the cast than the MCU but unlike the MCU, I felt like this film doesn't go overboard with the SJW stuff like the MCU films or The Star Wars Sequel films do. The Visuals were AMAZING, The Score by Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL was AMAZING as well, The Tone is just right as I actually felt for the characters emotionally, The Cinematography kept my eyes glued to the screen, and the script felt really Intelligent and Complex and despite people calling the writing confusing, I was able to piece it together with no problem whatsoever. This film is similar to Empire Strikes back in terms of popularity so over time after the other movies are released, this movie would probably be more popular.This film was way better than I Expected and deserves another chance.

"Its shame to see what critics and marvel fans did to this movie and targeted Zack Snyder for it. I have seen this movie more than 25 times till date. And i enjoy this movie as much as i enjoyed the first time. The fans who have read DC comics, wouldn't be disappointed in this movie. Its dark movie, yes it is. Because the title shows the intense situation at hand. Two superheroes about to rip each other apart for whatever reasons that brought them to this stage. Yes it had to be dark and intense.Only marvel can be stupid enough to show an alien invasion where humans are loosing the battle and the super heroes are cracking jokes while battles as if they are playing ping pong. a person playing Call of Duty game is more serious while playing than the marvel heroes fighting aliens."

"Last week some news came out from somebody online who had claimed to have seen a finished version of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. If you were like me, you've been leery of checking it out because you weren't sure how much might actually be true. Now Zack Snyder has spoken out about the spoiler-filled post, although his response doesn't really clear anything up.In a word, to MTV, he called the post \"hilarious,which might imply that he's saying that it's mostly, if not entirely, untrue. That might be the case, but then again he could have just said it was untrue and he didn't say that. What he did say, however, is that he doesn't like spoilers. While this may seem odd for the director who's most recent trailer appeared to give away the entire movie, Snyder says that's not the case. Even if you've seen the trailer, you can rest easy, as there is much more we have not seen in then finished film. Says Snyder I have the benefit of seeing the movie. It's cool that think it's too much, and I appreciate people not wanting to know, but there's plenty that they don't know. There's a lot of movie that's not in the trailer. In the process of calling the Batman v Superman Reddit review hilarious, Snyder goes on to talk about how he hates it when spoilers come out. The director would much rather that fans see the movie mostly blind. While he understands that some fans may wish to find the answers before hand, he wants his movies to be mysteries going in. If you're, as an audience member, exploring these articles, looking for answers to questions that you have, maybe you're okay with knowing before you go. It's like an individual taste. But like I said, I want people to see the movie without knowing.Spoilers are a topic that mean different things to different people. While most try to avoid them to some degree, the need to solve the mystery is a nearly universal human experience. We have an inclination to want to know the truth, even while also wanting to be surprised. For most of us getting some information is good, but getting all the information is bad, of course, only getting the details that you want can be difficult."
"The theatrical is choppy, poorly edited, hard to follow, with some really good moments mixed in their. The extended is much more fluent and is much easier to follow, it does have a long runtime, which might make it seem a bit dragging on, but if you like long films done right, like Lord of the Rings, you will like this movie as long as you get into the characters and story. Speaking of which, the story starts out perfectly showing Bruce Wayne as a character, and it is very powerful. There are several moments in this movie that are powerful, emotional, and shocking. Characters. Batman is my favorite fictional character of all time, and believe me when I say, Ben Affleck as Batman was perfect, he had the charisma, the anger, and the look of being through some bad stuff Gal Gadot also does perfect as Wonder Woman, but if you want to really see how good she does, go watch the Wonder Woman movie. Henry Call as Superman. I really don't like it when people say Christopher Reeves is better. Don't get me wrong, Reeves does great, but can you imagine him as Superman in this movie? I wouldn't like it. It would be like Adam West playing Batman in The Dark Knight. Henry Cavill does great in this role, I can say everything about him as I said with Ben Affleck. Jesse Eisenberg as Luthor. I thought it was different in a good way. I've heard a criticism for him as being too much like Joker, but is that a bad thing? Joker is my favorite villain, so to see Superman have an enemy that crazy, but still hold the values Luthor needs to be Luthor, I think it is great. The thing I thought this movie was lacking in the first and second acts was humor, at least good humor. If there was more humor, I would've given this movie a ten because it would give a more relaxing feel to the parts that needed it. All in all though, this movie was awesome, it had powerful moments, it was badass, and just plain fun. It had a great story arc and does its job very well."

"*I will be talking about the Ultimate Edition of the film* This was one of the most anticipated CBM of all time. Ever since the arrival and subsequent success of Marvel's The Avengers people have wondered when will DC launch its own cinematic universe, one of the main reasons being the opportunity to finally see titans such as Batman and Superman share the screen together: the ultimate nerd dream. On 2016, the moment finally came for BvS to be released AND.. it performed poorly. Not only did critical reception left a lot to be desired, but fan reactions where surprisingly split after its cinematic debut. People either loved it and called Zack a genius, or hated it and called him a hack. Me, personally, I found myself with middle of the road feelings, for sure, but more leaning towards the negative side with subsequent viewings. The theatrical cut of the film showcased amazing performances, incredible visuals, and action set pieces that seemed like comic book panels come to life, in a good way. However, when it comes to its narrative structure and more technical aspects like editing, the film was seriously flawed. More plot holes than Age of Ultron, questionable character decisions, random editing that lacked cohesion and focus, and forced dramatic moments that lacked any impact because the attempts at character development ranged from limited to nonexistent, especially when it comes to Superman's character. I thought it was a 5/10 movie at best. As such, I was kind of skeptical about the idea of a 30 minute longer version. I say kind of because I know how Zack works. I remember Watchmen being vastly improved with its director's cut, so in a way I was expecting BvS to perform in a similar manner, but I also feared those 30 minutes wold be just there to amplify action and discredit storytelling issues. Oh boy, I'm so glad I was proved wrong. The ultimate cut of the film was infuriating, but not because it was awful, but because it questions the sanity of WB executives and editors and makes you wonder what were they thinking during the editing process. What I got out of the Ultimate Edition was a thought-provoking deconstruction of two very iconic superheroes that gave spotlight to the struggles both of them face when they aren't fighting crime. What I got was an extremely well produced character study on both Batman and Superman in a cynical world, a world dangerously close to our own. We meet Batman as a ruthless, worn out hero that has seen the failure behind his ideals and witnessed some truly horrifying things in his life. Superman, on the other hand, is portrayed as a godlike figure that seeks to do good in the world, but finds himself emotionally conflicted once he realized that every good deed he does leaves behind a trail of destruction (most of it due to Luthor's antics). In my opinion, this is a hugely original approach, one that distances itself from the rest of the competition and delivers a dark, somber, yet relevant superhero movie that understands both characters and gives them real human struggles to deal with. I felt invested in both of them, and hoped that by the end of the film both could find a way to redeem themselves. Their character arcs were very well established during the first two acts of the movie, and by the time we get to the titular climactic battle the emotion behind the jaw-dropping action is intensified. Lex Luthor as a villain was also given more time to develop with this new edition. One of the main criticisms with the original version was the fact that his plan relied too much on conveniences, and the character's mannerisms and mad-scientist attitude was annoying, and that goes without saying his motivations were unclear. Not only do we spend more time understanding his hate for any godlike figure and thus his hatred for Superman, but the added scenes allowed us to witness his entire plan come to fruition. It sells the cold, manipulative, calculating attributes of his comic counterpart. The acting is spot on. Every actor owns his/her role, from Cavill's Superman, to Ben Affleck as Batman, Eisenberg as Luthor, and Gadot as Wonder Woman, whose scenes are brief, but are more than enough to sell the strong and ferocious warrior that she is. Cinematography is stunning, and miles above that of Man of Steel's. And the soundtrack by Zimmer and Junkie XL? Perfect, just perfect. When it comes to flaws, the film still has some of those. The Martha moment, while serving as a pivotal character moment for Batman, felt off in execution, and its understandable that many people got mad at it. If your main complaint about BvS the first time around was its bleak tone and subject matter, this film is still not for you. I understand most were expecting to see the heroes being the most iconic versions of themselves, clashing in an elongated battle and evoking the same feelings The Avengers gave audiences back in 2012. In that sense, the film will remain divisive, but at least I have the comfort of saying that, at the very least, the film is competently made."

"This film was amazing. Ben Affleck was easily the best part of this movie, he brought his a-game as Batman. The chemistry between Affleck & Irons was outstanding. Gal Gadot did a great job as Wonder Woman. The fight between Batman & Superman was awesome. The final fight with Doomsday was outstanding in every way possible. However, there is only one problem with this film and that's Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor. He was sadly missed cast in this role, but then again it's really the fault of Warner Bros. Studios. Overall, this film deliver on almost every level. I highly recommend that you watch the extended version of this film."

"I know I know. I saw it in theaters too, and felt like it could've been so much better. While the Batman element was good, the narrative felt fractured, and the third act was just one long stunt scene. Superman was relegated to a supporting character, and other characters didn't get a chance to shine. And then I chanced on the ultimate cut. Calling it 30 mins of \"extra\" footage is unfair to Zack Snyder because it's exactly these 30 mins that makes the movie a worthy one. What I can say about the theatrical cut is this - It had the blockbuster elements - music, visuals, stunts, CGI. But, it lacked the human elements. The first 20 mins of the movie had it, but not after that. The extended cut in comparison has a flow to the narrative. There are no disjointed scenes, everything flows smoothly, and there's connective tissue. Superman gets to spend some time with his father, and mother. Clark Kent does some investigative journalism. Superman helps the people after the blast. Lois Lane doesn't jump to conclusions, she gets to the bottom of the crime. Lex Luthor apparently had a coherent plan - everything is explained pretty well. Wonder Woman was already good, so there's no change there :) Also, the \"Martha\" scene seems better executed, because it is a few seconds longer, and there's time to breathe it in. So, here's my take on this movie - The theatrical cut was junk. Get the Bluray for ultimate edition, and you shall not be disappointed. I've seen it so many more times now, and it's the definitive cut. It is the movie we deserve. It's a unique take on Batman, and Superman. It's a gritty take on the superhero movie genre, and definitely the best DCEU movie, and the best DC movie since The Dark Knight.P.S. Yes it's dark. We're adults, and we should appreciate mature film making without intentionally silly moments. It attempts to be philosophical, and something deep instead of just trying to make you chuckle."

"This is one of the best superhero movies ever made. Zack Snyder is a magician behind the camera.The reason behind so many complaints is the fact that Warner Bros. marketed this movie as a fight between Batman and Superman. That's not what it is. It's a movie about the origins of the Justice League.The cinematography, the acting and the score are all second to none. This film is phenomenal.P.S: watch the 3 hour extended cut that Snyder intended you to see, not the 2 and a half hour movie that Warner Bros. decided would be better for theaters."

"I don't care what the critics say, this is a very well-done movie. I'll start my review by listing what I like about the movie.1.) Ben Affleck is the best batman to me and it is not close. He pulls off the role of an aging batman extremely well. Also, Zack Snyder's vision of batman is legit. I have always hated batman up until this adaptation of him. Instead of being a conflicted and idealistic batman, this batman is dark, gritty, and 100% a badass. His equipment is decked out with machine guns and he has no aversion to killing people. In fact, he probably kills about 50 criminal by the time this movie is over. The warehouse scene is the coolest batman scene in any movie.2.) The development of a grudge between batman and superman is pulled off flawlessly. It actually makes sense why batman dislikes superman. Then, when they do fight it is about the coolest thing you can expect to see from a superhero film. 3.) I disagree with a lot of people about Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor. In my opinion, he played his role to perfection. 4.) B v S sets up Wonder Woman and Justice League with Gal Gadot's cameo as Wonder Woman and short clips of Aquaman, the Flash, and Cyborg. B v S is one of my favorite superhero films and rewatching it never gets old."

"The theatrical cut of this film is garbage which is why I rated it eight stars instead of nine. The first time I watched this film I didn't like it (not straight out hate but didn't like). Character motivations didn't make any sense, Lex was annoying as s***, editing was sloppy, and it was overly dark and broody for an action superhero movie. A year + a half, five Marvel films, a ton of bad reviews and a Justice League later a thought popped into my head: \"what if I watched BVS again\". This time I didn't have trailers ruining the best moments, I only vaguely remembered the film, and I was conditioned to look at it negatively but something unexpected happened: I actually loved it. Superman was just a normal person that tried to make a difference cause he could that others imposed their own beliefs on. Lex Luthor was a genius that couldn't stand his powerlessness compared to Superman or more accurately a super being. As Alfred said \"The fever, the rage, the feeling of powerlessness that turns good men... cruel\" and you see the same thought process in Batman. Batman, just like Lex Luthor feels powerless in the midst of a god-being and just like Lex he attempts to destroy him so he can get his sense of power back but unlike Lex, Batman learns something. I what is one of the corniest lines of the movie Superman says, \"Martha\" when he knows he can't win against Batman in a late desperate attempt to save his mother. Not only does this name connect with Bruce Wayne but it also shows what really matters to a man of steel: it isn't power, it isn't fame or anything else, it is his Mother and on a broader scale it is people. Lex (who doesn't care about people at all) knows he doesn't have the power so he creates something from his blood and the remains of Zod: A Doomsday for Superman. Not only does this film have depth but it also doesn't always explain it to you which is rare in a blockbuster action superhero flick normally cater to semi-comic book fans and people that want to shove popcorn in their mouths. This film rewards you for really noticing the details while still having massive explosions. One of my favorites is how Lex has all of Batman's branded killed which is why he isn't afraid of the branding at the end or Grandma's Peach Tea as a way of scaring the s*** out of someone. Of course, this film isn't perfect and I do have personal dislikes. The Batman V Superman fight was slow and pretty boring especially after watching such an amazing fight in Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 2 (If you haven't watched the animated Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 1 and 2 you are sorely missing out on something fantastic). Also, the addition of Wonder Woman who pretty much steals a hacker thing, gives it back and then suits up and fights against a giant monster thing. Not to say I don't like Wonder Woman (She is one of my favorite Superheroes of all time who showed not only can woman kick a** but they also don't need to be ashamed of their sexuality or gender) but she wasn't really that helpful to the plot and just brought in to expand the universe which was well done through Lex's superhuman hunting files. Also, the post-apocalyptic scene that was just a dream could have been cut but nothing is perfect except movies like Citizen Kane which isn't a lot of fun to watch cause it is too perfect. So to summarize, the theatrical cut is bad, the ultimate cut is Amazing and the other cut is meh. Please give it a second chance because it deserves it and save a good director from losing grace because of something he didn't do."
"I really liked it, don't know what all the hate is about. I'm actually a Marvel fan from when I was 7 or so, but Superman and Batman together in 1 movie? Just great. And personally I like Ben Affleck even better than Christian Bale as Batman. So just watch and enjoy, I know I did!"

"That's right. We have been waiting for these two heroes to finally meet and fight against each other. This movie is so good in both plot and special effects.Henry Cavill and Ben Affleck have performed well in their acting stages. They are the best superhero actors and they have filmed their fighting scenes very well. The movie starts to show the conflict between the lives of the heroes and now they have blamed each other for it. This movie is amazing and sets up a good plot for Dawn Justice."

"Actually...I didn't know what to expect. When you see Wonder Woman, you know it will be off of Wonder Woman and off of a Wonder Woman story, but with Batman V Superman, I was like, \"hmmmm, so who is this about?\" It was pretty obvious that it would feature many characters, but I thought the introduction to Batman was amazing. Ben Affleck nailed the part, not only as Batman but also as Bruce Wayne. He is my Batman. Henry Cavill continued to be super as the Man of Steel. And he is my Super - Man. A dark story? Yes, without a doubt. Could it have had a few more jokes? Sure. But not all movies or stories need to have jokes when certain events are serious. I really hope people can see this review and take another look at the movie, because, I loved it. I really hope the ratings can go up, eventually. And P.S, this movie is the perfect set up to Justice League."

"I'll start by making it clear I have only ever seen the Ultimate Edition. I'm aware of what was cut out for the theatrical release, so I will concede up front that most of the criticisms about pacing, editing, and missing bits of plot at release were merited.With that caveat out of the way, I must reiterate that this was bar-none the boldest superhero movie I have ever seen. To me, it was arguably the best as well, though \"best\" shouldn't be taken to mean \"most enjoyable.\" That honor easily goes to \"Thor: Ragnarok.\" What makes BvS stand out among other films in the genre is that it takes two characters who have been done to death since the 1970s and brings them up to date. I recently tried to watch \"Superman: The Movie\" for the first time in a number of years, and while it was still good and Reeves will always be iconic, I just couldn't take it seriously. I'll put it this way: If the story in BvS was \"stupid\" in your view but Superman turning back time by spinning the earth backward on its axis didn't seem like one of the dumbest things you have ever seen -in any movie from any genre- to the extent that it outright ruins the movie for you, then your opinion about BvS isn't worth much. Nostalgic bias was always going to be a problem for this movie, and the way people reacted to and reviewed \"Man of Steel\" was telling in this regard.That brings me to Zack Snyder's take on Superman. You know, that guy whose status as the first extraterrestrial ever encountered by humanity was a total non-issue in the old movies. Apparently, Snyder has a similar view to my own in that his take on the Man of Steel makes his being an alien a core piece of his identity. He may look like any other (absurdly attractive) person, but he knows what he is, and that makes him perpetually uncertain of where he fits in this world. He is essentially good and really does care about people, but he struggles to truly empathize with the likes of us. To be human is to be frail, and that is not something he can easily relate to. This is the root of his conflict with Batman.Just as Clark struggles to genuinely relate to most people, Snyder's Batman either refuses to or otherwise just can't relate to Superman. He doesn't see him as anything but a threat regardless of Superman's clear good intentions. Remember, a small group of Kryptonians were able to bring humanity to the brink of extinction in less than a day, and Bruce Wayne is nothing if not a realist. He didn't know the guy from Kansas. He only knew the god from another world.While Batman's anger toward and fear of Superman are readily apparent from the start, Superman's inability to imagine things from Bruce Wayne's perspective only becomes truly apparent during their first real interaction. This reminded me of the animated version of the \"world's finest\" storyline, where Superman judges Batman harshly for using fear tactics and threats of violence (also, actual violence) to get the job done. Superman wasn't willing to consider what it would take for a human man to fight criminals and save innocents, or what that life would do to him over time. Just as Batman didn't see the guy from Kansas, Superman didn't see the man who lives his life trapped in one brutal, unthinkably traumatic moment (this was beautifully conveyed during the film's opening moments), and had spent his whole adult life bearing witness to humanity at its absolute worst.The conflict between these two characters is as old as human history. They want the same things, but they can't understand one another. So they fight. And what a fight it was.Watching a fight between, say, Captain America and Iron Man was, to me, more frustrating than anything because each understood the other's perspective perfectly. The fight between Batman and Superman in BvS was genuinely gut-wrenching, as intended, because they would have understood one another if either had tried. The whole sequence hilighted Batman's tactical prowess and ability to control a situation. Maybe the most badass thing about the fight was that it ended exactly where Batman planned. That brings me to the big elephant in the room named \"Martha.\"I can't recall exactly which YouTuber put it this way, but if you thought the \"save Martha\" exchange was about their mothers having the same name, you had your brain turned off. The brain-on people have explained this to death, but it bears repeating. This was the moment when Superman became humanized to Batman. He was about to die, and his only concern was for his adoptive human mother. He still believed that the man about to take his life would do the right thing. Even with the cowl on, there was no mistaking the look on Batman's face. It was the look of shame, guilt, and sudden uncertainty that says \"What am I doing?\" Turns out even the most brutal, angry version of Bruce Wayne is better than Tony Stark at knowing right from wrong. At knowing that he had gone too far.From there, the third act was a series of truly impressive (albeit mostly CGI) fight sequences, beginning with what I regard as the undisputed champion of Batman fights. Nothing in the Nolan movies (and especially nothing in the Burton movies) even came close. Go ahead, try to convince yourself that Batman and Bane taking turns punching one another in the face until Bane's mask broke was a good fight sequence. No, this was a fight straight out of \"Arkham Knight,\" and it was glorious. The battle against Doomsday really was one for the books. From the moment Wonder Woman arrived accompanied by the intense sounds of Tina Guo's electric cello to Superman's tragic, heroic death at the hands of Doomsday, I was glued to the screen. Sure, the mere presence of Doomsday spoiled the end to a degree, but watching the Man of Steel laboring to carry that kryptonite spear towards certain death was no less impactful. A brief word on Jesse Eisenberg's take on Lex Luthor. At least one other reviewer on this site already said it best when they pointed out that this was his origin story. If you consider his scheme objectively, he is actually one of the more formidable incarnations of the character. If we're lucky, we'll eventually get to see a Snyder Cut of \"Justice League\" and find out where this story was actually meant to go. For the record, Joss Whedon and Danny Elfman both should have said \"no\" to taking a dump on someone else's art."
"BATMAN V SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE brings a fantastic surprise to a smash-hit team-up with one of the worlds most beloved DC Comics' icons of all time. The movie delivers spectacular casting, and fantastic acting with different characters having their shine in each scenes.The story follows Clark Kent/Superman who becomes a threat, after the destruction in Metropolis in Man Of Steel.(2013). Batman/Bruce Wayne sees him as a threat and begins his war on Superman.The movie brings spectacular storytelling, it tells the complications of human against alien who are on the same side, and the first meeting of Batman and Superman. The story of Bruce Wayne, with his many years of The Caped Crusader, sends him on a spiral of \"out of control\", sheer anger, and builds tension to wanting to defeat the Man of Steel. Snyder has fantastically gave this storytelling an exciting nod to the comics.Lex Luthor, played by Jesse Einsberg, delivers a very interesting performance, but very differently by him showing is his \"origin\" before he becomes a bald foe to the Man of Steel. He shows that his love of \"god vs man\" terrorises mankind when he ultimately creates Doomsday, and Batman realises Superman's inner heroism.It packs so many great \"out of nowhere\" excitement, including a first-look of the fearful Wonder Woman a.k.a. Diana Prince, played by Gal Gadot, and a fresh-new glimpse of the superhero DC canon: The Justice League.WATCH THIS MOVIE! The critics are out of their mind. It's a fun-packed action adventure which still keeps the movie enjoyable until it's final minutes of the movie. It's a FANTASTIC MOVIE! BEN AFFLECK AS BATMAN... is Incredible!A 10/10 overall!"
"I want to go on record as saying that this is a truly thrilling cinematic experience in so many ways. If pressed, I guess I could acknowledge that there were a couple ... let's say \"clumsy\" moments. And in a film that runs to three hours, that hardly seems like a significant issue, certainly not enough to rate it with fewer than 9 stars.This film has everything. There is dramatic tension right from the start. There is a magnificent story arc that picks up quite seamlessly from 'Man of Steel' and propels the viewer not only into the life of Clark Kent/Superman but also of Bruce Wayne/Batman.The villain is no mere cartoon of a villain; he is truly thoroughly (and apparently irrevocably) diabolical. He is a psychopath, and you wish for his death over and over and over. You want Superman to reduce him to ash with the power of his eyes.I have read a number of viewers' reviews, and it seems that the people who disliked the film / gave it a low rating had rather unfair and unrealistic expectations of it. That is, their own prejudices about how the plot could/should unfold or what the character development could/should be, etc. ruined the film for them. And that is a shame.My thought is: I settle into my seat, wait for the lights to dim, and then I wait to be transported by the film. I accept it, lock, stock, and barrel.As another reviewer remarked, I love how the film begins from the point of view of Bruce Wayne as he is among people on the ground who have fallen victim to the attack of Zod and the other Kryptonians.Why would Bruce Wayne not like Superman? Why would the good people of Earth hurl insults at Superman and burn him in effigy (on the news)? Because the good people of Earth just got catapulted into a new reality in which there are not only extraterrestrial beings (surprise!) but they are also superman! And a group of them are hell-bent on destroying humankind and taking the planet for themselves.It is difficult to see Superman as separate from the whole Kryptonian Krew.It seems that many moviegoers forgot that Bruce Wayne is also human. Sure, he's a hero, but he is flawed.. Just like the rest of us. He is a vigilante, after all.He has let his vigilantism get the better of him. HE is actually the one working outside the boundaries of the law, not Superman. It is the clear head of Alfred that shows us that he has gone into a rather dark place, that he has not seen what is really going on (in Luthor's scheme), and so he chooses to embark on his own scheme scheme to take out the alien invader. He is (allegedly) thinking of the future: if he wipes out the all-powerful alien, then it can't turn on humankind in the future. At least, he convinces himself of that.A philosophical question is raised in the film: should Clark Kent have remained a simple man from Kansas and never have become the Superman? Should he just let people die and let calamities happen? The question is answered for us in the character of Diana Prince/Wonder Woman. She withdrew from mankind (her exact words) and just sat around watching. Watching while people died horrible deaths all around her. So, should Superman have done the same? Do these special beings, these 'metahumans', have some kind of moral imperative to intervene, or should they be allowed to be regular people, too? It seems that humans want it both ways.It seems that humans are saying: \"Don't be a superalien ... except when I and my friends and family are in trouble. Then come save us.\""

"Batman v Superman: Ultimate Edition: If your looking for a quick, cheap thrill then you might not enjoy this film at the time. This movies theatrical version was butchered by WB and in doing so reshaped the story leaving numerous plot holes. So the Ultimate Edition is the full story and the one worth seeing. Watch 'Man of Steel' before seeing this movie. There is much to claw through here, so much so that the audience might easily find themselves exhausted from the overall aggression of the film. However, a lot of the story does work. The action is good, and the emotion feels real most of the time.This film is about Superman trying to become Superman. Trying to help the world, save people, find a place in this world not as an outcast, and yet is looked at has a threat by many. Superman is not from this world, yet He is trying to be human, find a place in this world, be excepted by earths people, and come into his destiny.This film is also about Batman being Batman for 20 years and losing faith in humanity, and fearing Superman, what Superman can do with his powers. Great film, great plot, great visuals. ---Yidioo"
"I didn't see the film in the theaters and just bought the \"Extended Edition \" on Amazon. I never properly saw Man of Steel- i think I rented it and watched it when already exhausted and fell asleep. I saw the mediocre user reviews and horrible reviews from critics of this film.They really have it wrong. This is the very best either Batman or Superman. It has a different take, on things. Much darker then earlier films even darker then the Christopher Nolan Batman films.First of all Christopher Nolan is an Executive Producer. So how bad could it be? I loved Sucker Punch and Zack Snyder was involved with that. So how bad could this be? Hans Zimmer did the music, so how bad could it be?I remember watching the old Superman TV shows and reading the Superman and Batman comics as a little kid and loved them, but i wouldn't call myself a \"fan boy\" of comic universes, like so many younger people today. As an older adult I will admit my favorite TV show of all time was Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but watched it on DVD only after it had finished. I saw the second of the Dark Knight series in the theater, but the other two, I watched on DVD. They were great, but not my favorite films like so many people. i also loved the first couple Superman and Batman films in the older series. Regardless, i was not waiting with baited breath to see Man of Steel or this one.I'm more of a serious film fan, who can watch Stanley Kubrick films over and over and my favorite films in the last twenty years, are Eyes Wide Shut and Intersteller, both of which i've watched multiple times.So, with that said, take it from me, the critics have this film very wrong, just as critics hated 2001: A Space Odyssey when it first came out. This film will have lasting appreciation.Surprised how much I liked Ben Afleck's Batman. it was hard to get into Henry Cavil's scrawnier looking Superman, but it grew on me. Amy Adams was great as Lois Lane, The Gal Gadol Wonder Women was amazing. Lex Luther was terrific, like Nolan's Joker. Jeremy Irons was the best Alfred ever. Holly Hunter and Diane Lane was good too. The movie had bad reviews but made a billion dollars. Hopefully everyone buys the Ultimate Edition and it breaks sales records and the film is re-appreciated. I have no idea what scenes this Ultimate Edition added, but it is pretty perfect. Now I can't wait for Wonder Woman and the Justice League and as soon as I finish writing this am going to watch Man of Steal. I'm into it now!I can only surmise that the bad reviews stem from too much expectations of the rigid fan boy types and the radical changes in tone, we see in this film.Total masterpiece of cinema, but I have a few criticisms. There are a few hollow scenes of typical Idiot cops and authorities getting everything wrong in a cliché type way and it has a few filler scenes of that type and a few moments here and there that felt rushed and cheesy. Maybe not everything restored into the Ultimate Edition should have been. I wish there had been more Kevin Costner scenes."

"The whole entire Batman V Superman movie was great and yes even though it felt slow to the majority of the people who watched it but to me I enjoyed every part and every scene of Batman V Superman and when it got to the fight scenes both batman VS Superman and the Doomsday fight it brought so much drama, intensity, and epic performances. So with that being said I give this movie a good 10/10 because it really did go to my expectations and it brought a powerful performance and a powerful yet epic introduction to the upcoming Justice League."

"When I first wrote a review for this movie a year ago exclaiming my excitement for the film, I had been high off a fresh dose of live-action DC superheroes playing out the beloved comic book stories that I had grown up on. It was all playing out before my eyes and coming to life. After a few months had passed, I began to notice things about the movie that I disliked: little gaps in the story, things that didn't add up, etc. My original rating of a 10 / 10 dropped to an 8 /10. But today it has gone back up to a 10. The extended version of the film not only rectifies the gaps but also silences critics.Many claimed that the movie was too dark or that it just didn't make sense. To those people, I say: \"Pick up a comic book!\" Many of the critics of this particular film were part of the superhero bandwagon that formed when Marvel began its spree of Avengers-related films. In fact, its estimated that over 60% of people who go to see 'superhero' genre films have never picked up a comic book in their life. I would argue that similar numbers could figure to those which view the CW televised DC Universe shows. People complain that DC comics is just too dark but the fact is that these movies are based upon actual comics which are meant to be dark (ex: The Dark Knight Returns, Injustice, etc.). Its like complaining that Game of Thrones (the TV series) sucks because they kill off too many characters. Read the books! Its frustrating to see such a beautiful work of art like Batman V Superman criticized by those ignorant to its universe and its meaning. This movie is in fact a catalyst that opens numerous doorways and leaves true fans in awe of the possibilities for future movies. But regardless of whether or not people choose to educate themselves, this film's DVD/Blu-ray extended version puts the theater release to shame. All of the plot holes and gaps are filled in 30 minutes of extended footage scattered throughout the film. The movie ultimately becomes more complete and people will wish that the movie had shown the full 3 hours of footage in its theatrical debut. As a major DC comics fan, I will of course pick up on things that a comics fan would not, but someone who does not read comics would learn to appreciate this film in its entirety with the extended version. Get your hands on a copy today or find it on Netflix or the internet somewhere!"

"I ignored the bad reviews and watched anyways. This film had a lot to live up to after Civil War was released and I went into this film expecting the worst. It ended up to be the best Superhero film of 2016 to me. One complaint was that this film was more concerned about universe building than telling a great story than Civil War but for me it was the other way around; Civil War felt like a build up to something else and to be honest, I felt that way when I saw the other MCU films. Batman vs Superman however not only had a great story, but it also felt a lot more consistent than Civil War. This film was way more diverse with the cast than the MCU but unlike the MCU, I felt like this film doesn't go overboard with the SJW stuff like the MCU films or The Star Wars Sequel films do. The Visuals were AMAZING, The Score by Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL was AMAZING as well, The Tone is just right as I actually felt for the characters emotionally, The Cinematography kept my eyes glued to the screen, and the script felt really Intelligent and Complex and despite people calling the writing confusing, I was able to piece it together with no problem whatsoever. This film is similar to Empire Strikes back in terms of popularity so over time after the other movies are released, this movie would probably be more popular.This film was way better than I Expected and deserves another chance.

"Its shame to see what critics and marvel fans did to this movie and targeted Zack Snyder for it. I have seen this movie more than 25 times till date. And i enjoy this movie as much as i enjoyed the first time. The fans who have read DC comics, wouldn't be disappointed in this movie. Its dark movie, yes it is. Because the title shows the intense situation at hand. Two superheroes about to rip each other apart for whatever reasons that brought them to this stage. Yes it had to be dark and intense.Only marvel can be stupid enough to show an alien invasion where humans are loosing the battle and the super heroes are cracking jokes while battles as if they are playing ping pong. a person playing Call of Duty game is more serious while playing than the marvel heroes fighting aliens."

"Last week some news came out from somebody online who had claimed to have seen a finished version of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. If you were like me, you've been leery of checking it out because you weren't sure how much might actually be true. Now Zack Snyder has spoken out about the spoiler-filled post, although his response doesn't really clear anything up.In a word, to MTV, he called the post \"hilarious,which might imply that he's saying that it's mostly, if not entirely, untrue. That might be the case, but then again he could have just said it was untrue and he didn't say that. What he did say, however, is that he doesn't like spoilers. While this may seem odd for the director who's most recent trailer appeared to give away the entire movie, Snyder says that's not the case. Even if you've seen the trailer, you can rest easy, as there is much more we have not seen in then finished film. Says Snyder I have the benefit of seeing the movie. It's cool that think it's too much, and I appreciate people not wanting to know, but there's plenty that they don't know. There's a lot of movie that's not in the trailer. In the process of calling the Batman v Superman Reddit review hilarious, Snyder goes on to talk about how he hates it when spoilers come out. The director would much rather that fans see the movie mostly blind. While he understands that some fans may wish to find the answers before hand, he wants his movies to be mysteries going in. If you're, as an audience member, exploring these articles, looking for answers to questions that you have, maybe you're okay with knowing before you go. It's like an individual taste. But like I said, I want people to see the movie without knowing.Spoilers are a topic that mean different things to different people. While most try to avoid them to some degree, the need to solve the mystery is a nearly universal human experience. We have an inclination to want to know the truth, even while also wanting to be surprised. For most of us getting some information is good, but getting all the information is bad, of course, only getting the details that you want can be difficult."
"The theatrical is choppy, poorly edited, hard to follow, with some really good moments mixed in their. The extended is much more fluent and is much easier to follow, it does have a long runtime, which might make it seem a bit dragging on, but if you like long films done right, like Lord of the Rings, you will like this movie as long as you get into the characters and story. Speaking of which, the story starts out perfectly showing Bruce Wayne as a character, and it is very powerful. There are several moments in this movie that are powerful, emotional, and shocking. Characters. Batman is my favorite fictional character of all time, and believe me when I say, Ben Affleck as Batman was perfect, he had the charisma, the anger, and the look of being through some bad stuff Gal Gadot also does perfect as Wonder Woman, but if you want to really see how good she does, go watch the Wonder Woman movie. Henry Call as Superman. I really don't like it when people say Christopher Reeves is better. Don't get me wrong, Reeves does great, but can you imagine him as Superman in this movie? I wouldn't like it. It would be like Adam West playing Batman in The Dark Knight. Henry Cavill does great in this role, I can say everything about him as I said with Ben Affleck. Jesse Eisenberg as Luthor. I thought it was different in a good way. I've heard a criticism for him as being too much like Joker, but is that a bad thing? Joker is my favorite villain, so to see Superman have an enemy that crazy, but still hold the values Luthor needs to be Luthor, I think it is great. The thing I thought this movie was lacking in the first and second acts was humor, at least good humor. If there was more humor, I would've given this movie a ten because it would give a more relaxing feel to the parts that needed it. All in all though, this movie was awesome, it had powerful moments, it was badass, and just plain fun. It had a great story arc and does its job very well."

"*I will be talking about the Ultimate Edition of the film* This was one of the most anticipated CBM of all time. Ever since the arrival and subsequent success of Marvel's The Avengers people have wondered when will DC launch its own cinematic universe, one of the main reasons being the opportunity to finally see titans such as Batman and Superman share the screen together: the ultimate nerd dream. On 2016, the moment finally came for BvS to be released AND.. it performed poorly. Not only did critical reception left a lot to be desired, but fan reactions where surprisingly split after its cinematic debut. People either loved it and called Zack a genius, or hated it and called him a hack. Me, personally, I found myself with middle of the road feelings, for sure, but more leaning towards the negative side with subsequent viewings. The theatrical cut of the film showcased amazing performances, incredible visuals, and action set pieces that seemed like comic book panels come to life, in a good way. However, when it comes to its narrative structure and more technical aspects like editing, the film was seriously flawed. More plot holes than Age of Ultron, questionable character decisions, random editing that lacked cohesion and focus, and forced dramatic moments that lacked any impact because the attempts at character development ranged from limited to nonexistent, especially when it comes to Superman's character. I thought it was a 5/10 movie at best. As such, I was kind of skeptical about the idea of a 30 minute longer version. I say kind of because I know how Zack works. I remember Watchmen being vastly improved with its director's cut, so in a way I was expecting BvS to perform in a similar manner, but I also feared those 30 minutes wold be just there to amplify action and discredit storytelling issues. Oh boy, I'm so glad I was proved wrong. The ultimate cut of the film was infuriating, but not because it was awful, but because it questions the sanity of WB executives and editors and makes you wonder what were they thinking during the editing process. What I got out of the Ultimate Edition was a thought-provoking deconstruction of two very iconic superheroes that gave spotlight to the struggles both of them face when they aren't fighting crime. What I got was an extremely well produced character study on both Batman and Superman in a cynical world, a world dangerously close to our own. We meet Batman as a ruthless, worn out hero that has seen the failure behind his ideals and witnessed some truly horrifying things in his life. Superman, on the other hand, is portrayed as a godlike figure that seeks to do good in the world, but finds himself emotionally conflicted once he realized that every good deed he does leaves behind a trail of destruction (most of it due to Luthor's antics). In my opinion, this is a hugely original approach, one that distances itself from the rest of the competition and delivers a dark, somber, yet relevant superhero movie that understands both characters and gives them real human struggles to deal with. I felt invested in both of them, and hoped that by the end of the film both could find a way to redeem themselves. Their character arcs were very well established during the first two acts of the movie, and by the time we get to the titular climactic battle the emotion behind the jaw-dropping action is intensified. Lex Luthor as a villain was also given more time to develop with this new edition. One of the main criticisms with the original version was the fact that his plan relied too much on conveniences, and the character's mannerisms and mad-scientist attitude was annoying, and that goes without saying his motivations were unclear. Not only do we spend more time understanding his hate for any godlike figure and thus his hatred for Superman, but the added scenes allowed us to witness his entire plan come to fruition. It sells the cold, manipulative, calculating attributes of his comic counterpart. The acting is spot on. Every actor owns his/her role, from Cavill's Superman, to Ben Affleck as Batman, Eisenberg as Luthor, and Gadot as Wonder Woman, whose scenes are brief, but are more than enough to sell the strong and ferocious warrior that she is. Cinematography is stunning, and miles above that of Man of Steel's. And the soundtrack by Zimmer and Junkie XL? Perfect, just perfect. When it comes to flaws, the film still has some of those. The Martha moment, while serving as a pivotal character moment for Batman, felt off in execution, and its understandable that many people got mad at it. If your main complaint about BvS the first time around was its bleak tone and subject matter, this film is still not for you. I understand most were expecting to see the heroes being the most iconic versions of themselves, clashing in an elongated battle and evoking the same feelings The Avengers gave audiences back in 2012. In that sense, the film will remain divisive, but at least I have the comfort of saying that, at the very least, the film is competently made."

"This film was amazing. Ben Affleck was easily the best part of this movie, he brought his a-game as Batman. The chemistry between Affleck & Irons was outstanding. Gal Gadot did a great job as Wonder Woman. The fight between Batman & Superman was awesome. The final fight with Doomsday was outstanding in every way possible. However, there is only one problem with this film and that's Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor. He was sadly missed cast in this role, but then again it's really the fault of Warner Bros. Studios. Overall, this film deliver on almost every level. I highly recommend that you watch the extended version of this film."

"I know I know. I saw it in theaters too, and felt like it could've been so much better. While the Batman element was good, the narrative felt fractured, and the third act was just one long stunt scene. Superman was relegated to a supporting character, and other characters didn't get a chance to shine. And then I chanced on the ultimate cut. Calling it 30 mins of \"extra\" footage is unfair to Zack Snyder because it's exactly these 30 mins that makes the movie a worthy one. What I can say about the theatrical cut is this - It had the blockbuster elements - music, visuals, stunts, CGI. But, it lacked the human elements. The first 20 mins of the movie had it, but not after that. The extended cut in comparison has a flow to the narrative. There are no disjointed scenes, everything flows smoothly, and there's connective tissue. Superman gets to spend some time with his father, and mother. Clark Kent does some investigative journalism. Superman helps the people after the blast. Lois Lane doesn't jump to conclusions, she gets to the bottom of the crime. Lex Luthor apparently had a coherent plan - everything is explained pretty well. Wonder Woman was already good, so there's no change there :) Also, the \"Martha\" scene seems better executed, because it is a few seconds longer, and there's time to breathe it in. So, here's my take on this movie - The theatrical cut was junk. Get the Bluray for ultimate edition, and you shall not be disappointed. I've seen it so many more times now, and it's the definitive cut. It is the movie we deserve. It's a unique take on Batman, and Superman. It's a gritty take on the superhero movie genre, and definitely the best DCEU movie, and the best DC movie since The Dark Knight.P.S. Yes it's dark. We're adults, and we should appreciate mature film making without intentionally silly moments. It attempts to be philosophical, and something deep instead of just trying to make you chuckle."

"This is one of the best superhero movies ever made. Zack Snyder is a magician behind the camera.The reason behind so many complaints is the fact that Warner Bros. marketed this movie as a fight between Batman and Superman. That's not what it is. It's a movie about the origins of the Justice League.The cinematography, the acting and the score are all second to none. This film is phenomenal.P.S: watch the 3 hour extended cut that Snyder intended you to see, not the 2 and a half hour movie that Warner Bros. decided would be better for theaters."

"I don't care what the critics say, this is a very well-done movie. I'll start my review by listing what I like about the movie.1.) Ben Affleck is the best batman to me and it is not close. He pulls off the role of an aging batman extremely well. Also, Zack Snyder's vision of batman is legit. I have always hated batman up until this adaptation of him. Instead of being a conflicted and idealistic batman, this batman is dark, gritty, and 100% a badass. His equipment is decked out with machine guns and he has no aversion to killing people. In fact, he probably kills about 50 criminal by the time this movie is over. The warehouse scene is the coolest batman scene in any movie.2.) The development of a grudge between batman and superman is pulled off flawlessly. It actually makes sense why batman dislikes superman. Then, when they do fight it is about the coolest thing you can expect to see from a superhero film. 3.) I disagree with a lot of people about Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor. In my opinion, he played his role to perfection. 4.) B v S sets up Wonder Woman and Justice League with Gal Gadot's cameo as Wonder Woman and short clips of Aquaman, the Flash, and Cyborg. B v S is one of my favorite superhero films and rewatching it never gets old."

"The theatrical cut of this film is garbage which is why I rated it eight stars instead of nine. The first time I watched this film I didn't like it (not straight out hate but didn't like). Character motivations didn't make any sense, Lex was annoying as s***, editing was sloppy, and it was overly dark and broody for an action superhero movie. A year + a half, five Marvel films, a ton of bad reviews and a Justice League later a thought popped into my head: \"what if I watched BVS again\". This time I didn't have trailers ruining the best moments, I only vaguely remembered the film, and I was conditioned to look at it negatively but something unexpected happened: I actually loved it. Superman was just a normal person that tried to make a difference cause he could that others imposed their own beliefs on. Lex Luthor was a genius that couldn't stand his powerlessness compared to Superman or more accurately a super being. As Alfred said \"The fever, the rage, the feeling of powerlessness that turns good men... cruel\" and you see the same thought process in Batman. Batman, just like Lex Luthor feels powerless in the midst of a god-being and just like Lex he attempts to destroy him so he can get his sense of power back but unlike Lex, Batman learns something. I what is one of the corniest lines of the movie Superman says, \"Martha\" when he knows he can't win against Batman in a late desperate attempt to save his mother. Not only does this name connect with Bruce Wayne but it also shows what really matters to a man of steel: it isn't power, it isn't fame or anything else, it is his Mother and on a broader scale it is people. Lex (who doesn't care about people at all) knows he doesn't have the power so he creates something from his blood and the remains of Zod: A Doomsday for Superman. Not only does this film have depth but it also doesn't always explain it to you which is rare in a blockbuster action superhero flick normally cater to semi-comic book fans and people that want to shove popcorn in their mouths. This film rewards you for really noticing the details while still having massive explosions. One of my favorites is how Lex has all of Batman's branded killed which is why he isn't afraid of the branding at the end or Grandma's Peach Tea as a way of scaring the s*** out of someone. Of course, this film isn't perfect and I do have personal dislikes. The Batman V Superman fight was slow and pretty boring especially after watching such an amazing fight in Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 2 (If you haven't watched the animated Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 1 and 2 you are sorely missing out on something fantastic). Also, the addition of Wonder Woman who pretty much steals a hacker thing, gives it back and then suits up and fights against a giant monster thing. Not to say I don't like Wonder Woman (She is one of my favorite Superheroes of all time who showed not only can woman kick a** but they also don't need to be ashamed of their sexuality or gender) but she wasn't really that helpful to the plot and just brought in to expand the universe which was well done through Lex's superhuman hunting files. Also, the post-apocalyptic scene that was just a dream could have been cut but nothing is perfect except movies like Citizen Kane which isn't a lot of fun to watch cause it is too perfect. So to summarize, the theatrical cut is bad, the ultimate cut is Amazing and the other cut is meh. Please give it a second chance because it deserves it and save a good director from losing grace because of something he didn't do."
"I really liked it, don't know what all the hate is about. I'm actually a Marvel fan from when I was 7 or so, but Superman and Batman together in 1 movie? Just great. And personally I like Ben Affleck even better than Christian Bale as Batman. So just watch and enjoy, I know I did!"

"That's right. We have been waiting for these two heroes to finally meet and fight against each other. This movie is so good in both plot and special effects.Henry Cavill and Ben Affleck have performed well in their acting stages. They are the best superhero actors and they have filmed their fighting scenes very well. The movie starts to show the conflict between the lives of the heroes and now they have blamed each other for it. This movie is amazing and sets up a good plot for Dawn Justice."

"Actually...I didn't know what to expect. When you see Wonder Woman, you know it will be off of Wonder Woman and off of a Wonder Woman story, but with Batman V Superman, I was like, \"hmmmm, so who is this about?\" It was pretty obvious that it would feature many characters, but I thought the introduction to Batman was amazing. Ben Affleck nailed the part, not only as Batman but also as Bruce Wayne. He is my Batman. Henry Cavill continued to be super as the Man of Steel. And he is my Super - Man. A dark story? Yes, without a doubt. Could it have had a few more jokes? Sure. But not all movies or stories need to have jokes when certain events are serious. I really hope people can see this review and take another look at the movie, because, I loved it. I really hope the ratings can go up, eventually. And P.S, this movie is the perfect set up to Justice League."

"I'll start by making it clear I have only ever seen the Ultimate Edition. I'm aware of what was cut out for the theatrical release, so I will concede up front that most of the criticisms about pacing, editing, and missing bits of plot at release were merited.With that caveat out of the way, I must reiterate that this was bar-none the boldest superhero movie I have ever seen. To me, it was arguably the best as well, though \"best\" shouldn't be taken to mean \"most enjoyable.\" That honor easily goes to \"Thor: Ragnarok.\" What makes BvS stand out among other films in the genre is that it takes two characters who have been done to death since the 1970s and brings them up to date. I recently tried to watch \"Superman: The Movie\" for the first time in a number of years, and while it was still good and Reeves will always be iconic, I just couldn't take it seriously. I'll put it this way: If the story in BvS was \"stupid\" in your view but Superman turning back time by spinning the earth backward on its axis didn't seem like one of the dumbest things you have ever seen -in any movie from any genre- to the extent that it outright ruins the movie for you, then your opinion about BvS isn't worth much. Nostalgic bias was always going to be a problem for this movie, and the way people reacted to and reviewed \"Man of Steel\" was telling in this regard.That brings me to Zack Snyder's take on Superman. You know, that guy whose status as the first extraterrestrial ever encountered by humanity was a total non-issue in the old movies. Apparently, Snyder has a similar view to my own in that his take on the Man of Steel makes his being an alien a core piece of his identity. He may look like any other (absurdly attractive) person, but he knows what he is, and that makes him perpetually uncertain of where he fits in this world. He is essentially good and really does care about people, but he struggles to truly empathize with the likes of us. To be human is to be frail, and that is not something he can easily relate to. This is the root of his conflict with Batman.Just as Clark struggles to genuinely relate to most people, Snyder's Batman either refuses to or otherwise just can't relate to Superman. He doesn't see him as anything but a threat regardless of Superman's clear good intentions. Remember, a small group of Kryptonians were able to bring humanity to the brink of extinction in less than a day, and Bruce Wayne is nothing if not a realist. He didn't know the guy from Kansas. He only knew the god from another world.While Batman's anger toward and fear of Superman are readily apparent from the start, Superman's inability to imagine things from Bruce Wayne's perspective only becomes truly apparent during their first real interaction. This reminded me of the animated version of the \"world's finest\" storyline, where Superman judges Batman harshly for using fear tactics and threats of violence (also, actual violence) to get the job done. Superman wasn't willing to consider what it would take for a human man to fight criminals and save innocents, or what that life would do to him over time. Just as Batman didn't see the guy from Kansas, Superman didn't see the man who lives his life trapped in one brutal, unthinkably traumatic moment (this was beautifully conveyed during the film's opening moments), and had spent his whole adult life bearing witness to humanity at its absolute worst.The conflict between these two characters is as old as human history. They want the same things, but they can't understand one another. So they fight. And what a fight it was.Watching a fight between, say, Captain America and Iron Man was, to me, more frustrating than anything because each understood the other's perspective perfectly. The fight between Batman and Superman in BvS was genuinely gut-wrenching, as intended, because they would have understood one another if either had tried. The whole sequence hilighted Batman's tactical prowess and ability to control a situation. Maybe the most badass thing about the fight was that it ended exactly where Batman planned. That brings me to the big elephant in the room named \"Martha.\"I can't recall exactly which YouTuber put it this way, but if you thought the \"save Martha\" exchange was about their mothers having the same name, you had your brain turned off. The brain-on people have explained this to death, but it bears repeating. This was the moment when Superman became humanized to Batman. He was about to die, and his only concern was for his adoptive human mother. He still believed that the man about to take his life would do the right thing. Even with the cowl on, there was no mistaking the look on Batman's face. It was the look of shame, guilt, and sudden uncertainty that says \"What am I doing?\" Turns out even the most brutal, angry version of Bruce Wayne is better than Tony Stark at knowing right from wrong. At knowing that he had gone too far.From there, the third act was a series of truly impressive (albeit mostly CGI) fight sequences, beginning with what I regard as the undisputed champion of Batman fights. Nothing in the Nolan movies (and especially nothing in the Burton movies) even came close. Go ahead, try to convince yourself that Batman and Bane taking turns punching one another in the face until Bane's mask broke was a good fight sequence. No, this was a fight straight out of \"Arkham Knight,\" and it was glorious. The battle against Doomsday really was one for the books. From the moment Wonder Woman arrived accompanied by the intense sounds of Tina Guo's electric cello to Superman's tragic, heroic death at the hands of Doomsday, I was glued to the screen. Sure, the mere presence of Doomsday spoiled the end to a degree, but watching the Man of Steel laboring to carry that kryptonite spear towards certain death was no less impactful. A brief word on Jesse Eisenberg's take on Lex Luthor. At least one other reviewer on this site already said it best when they pointed out that this was his origin story. If you consider his scheme objectively, he is actually one of the more formidable incarnations of the character. If we're lucky, we'll eventually get to see a Snyder Cut of \"Justice League\" and find out where this story was actually meant to go. For the record, Joss Whedon and Danny Elfman both should have said \"no\" to taking a dump on someone else's art."
"BATMAN V SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE brings a fantastic surprise to a smash-hit team-up with one of the worlds most beloved DC Comics' icons of all time. The movie delivers spectacular casting, and fantastic acting with different characters having their shine in each scenes.The story follows Clark Kent/Superman who becomes a threat, after the destruction in Metropolis in Man Of Steel.(2013). Batman/Bruce Wayne sees him as a threat and begins his war on Superman.The movie brings spectacular storytelling, it tells the complications of human against alien who are on the same side, and the first meeting of Batman and Superman. The story of Bruce Wayne, with his many years of The Caped Crusader, sends him on a spiral of \"out of control\", sheer anger, and builds tension to wanting to defeat the Man of Steel. Snyder has fantastically gave this storytelling an exciting nod to the comics.Lex Luthor, played by Jesse Einsberg, delivers a very interesting performance, but very differently by him showing is his \"origin\" before he becomes a bald foe to the Man of Steel. He shows that his love of \"god vs man\" terrorises mankind when he ultimately creates Doomsday, and Batman realises Superman's inner heroism.It packs so many great \"out of nowhere\" excitement, including a first-look of the fearful Wonder Woman a.k.a. Diana Prince, played by Gal Gadot, and a fresh-new glimpse of the superhero DC canon: The Justice League.WATCH THIS MOVIE! The critics are out of their mind. It's a fun-packed action adventure which still keeps the movie enjoyable until it's final minutes of the movie. It's a FANTASTIC MOVIE! BEN AFFLECK AS BATMAN... is Incredible!A 10/10 overall!"
"I want to go on record as saying that this is a truly thrilling cinematic experience in so many ways. If pressed, I guess I could acknowledge that there were a couple ... let's say \"clumsy\" moments. And in a film that runs to three hours, that hardly seems like a significant issue, certainly not enough to rate it with fewer than 9 stars.This film has everything. There is dramatic tension right from the start. There is a magnificent story arc that picks up quite seamlessly from 'Man of Steel' and propels the viewer not only into the life of Clark Kent/Superman but also of Bruce Wayne/Batman.The villain is no mere cartoon of a villain; he is truly thoroughly (and apparently irrevocably) diabolical. He is a psychopath, and you wish for his death over and over and over. You want Superman to reduce him to ash with the power of his eyes.I have read a number of viewers' reviews, and it seems that the people who disliked the film / gave it a low rating had rather unfair and unrealistic expectations of it. That is, their own prejudices about how the plot could/should unfold or what the character development could/should be, etc. ruined the film for them. And that is a shame.My thought is: I settle into my seat, wait for the lights to dim, and then I wait to be transported by the film. I accept it, lock, stock, and barrel.As another reviewer remarked, I love how the film begins from the point of view of Bruce Wayne as he is among people on the ground who have fallen victim to the attack of Zod and the other Kryptonians.Why would Bruce Wayne not like Superman? Why would the good people of Earth hurl insults at Superman and burn him in effigy (on the news)? Because the good people of Earth just got catapulted into a new reality in which there are not only extraterrestrial beings (surprise!) but they are also superman! And a group of them are hell-bent on destroying humankind and taking the planet for themselves.It is difficult to see Superman as separate from the whole Kryptonian Krew.It seems that many moviegoers forgot that Bruce Wayne is also human. Sure, he's a hero, but he is flawed.. Just like the rest of us. He is a vigilante, after all.He has let his vigilantism get the better of him. HE is actually the one working outside the boundaries of the law, not Superman. It is the clear head of Alfred that shows us that he has gone into a rather dark place, that he has not seen what is really going on (in Luthor's scheme), and so he chooses to embark on his own scheme scheme to take out the alien invader. He is (allegedly) thinking of the future: if he wipes out the all-powerful alien, then it can't turn on humankind in the future. At least, he convinces himself of that.A philosophical question is raised in the film: should Clark Kent have remained a simple man from Kansas and never have become the Superman? Should he just let people die and let calamities happen? The question is answered for us in the character of Diana Prince/Wonder Woman. She withdrew from mankind (her exact words) and just sat around watching. Watching while people died horrible deaths all around her. So, should Superman have done the same? Do these special beings, these 'metahumans', have some kind of moral imperative to intervene, or should they be allowed to be regular people, too? It seems that humans want it both ways.It seems that humans are saying: \"Don't be a superalien ... except when I and my friends and family are in trouble. Then come save us.\""

"Batman v Superman: Ultimate Edition: If your looking for a quick, cheap thrill then you might not enjoy this film at the time. This movies theatrical version was butchered by WB and in doing so reshaped the story leaving numerous plot holes. So the Ultimate Edition is the full story and the one worth seeing. Watch 'Man of Steel' before seeing this movie. There is much to claw through here, so much so that the audience might easily find themselves exhausted from the overall aggression of the film. However, a lot of the story does work. The action is good, and the emotion feels real most of the time.This film is about Superman trying to become Superman. Trying to help the world, save people, find a place in this world not as an outcast, and yet is looked at has a threat by many. Superman is not from this world, yet He is trying to be human, find a place in this world, be excepted by earths people, and come into his destiny.This film is also about Batman being Batman for 20 years and losing faith in humanity, and fearing Superman, what Superman can do with his powers. Great film, great plot, great visuals. ---Yidioo"
"I didn't see the film in the theaters and just bought the \"Extended Edition \" on Amazon. I never properly saw Man of Steel- i think I rented it and watched it when already exhausted and fell asleep. I saw the mediocre user reviews and horrible reviews from critics of this film.They really have it wrong. This is the very best either Batman or Superman. It has a different take, on things. Much darker then earlier films even darker then the Christopher Nolan Batman films.First of all Christopher Nolan is an Executive Producer. So how bad could it be? I loved Sucker Punch and Zack Snyder was involved with that. So how bad could this be? Hans Zimmer did the music, so how bad could it be?I remember watching the old Superman TV shows and reading the Superman and Batman comics as a little kid and loved them, but i wouldn't call myself a \"fan boy\" of comic universes, like so many younger people today. As an older adult I will admit my favorite TV show of all time was Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but watched it on DVD only after it had finished. I saw the second of the Dark Knight series in the theater, but the other two, I watched on DVD. They were great, but not my favorite films like so many people. i also loved the first couple Superman and Batman films in the older series. Regardless, i was not waiting with baited breath to see Man of Steel or this one.I'm more of a serious film fan, who can watch Stanley Kubrick films over and over and my favorite films in the last twenty years, are Eyes Wide Shut and Intersteller, both of which i've watched multiple times.So, with that said, take it from me, the critics have this film very wrong, just as critics hated 2001: A Space Odyssey when it first came out. This film will have lasting appreciation.Surprised how much I liked Ben Afleck's Batman. it was hard to get into Henry Cavil's scrawnier looking Superman, but it grew on me. Amy Adams was great as Lois Lane, The Gal Gadol Wonder Women was amazing. Lex Luther was terrific, like Nolan's Joker. Jeremy Irons was the best Alfred ever. Holly Hunter and Diane Lane was good too. The movie had bad reviews but made a billion dollars. Hopefully everyone buys the Ultimate Edition and it breaks sales records and the film is re-appreciated. I have no idea what scenes this Ultimate Edition added, but it is pretty perfect. Now I can't wait for Wonder Woman and the Justice League and as soon as I finish writing this am going to watch Man of Steal. I'm into it now!I can only surmise that the bad reviews stem from too much expectations of the rigid fan boy types and the radical changes in tone, we see in this film.Total masterpiece of cinema, but I have a few criticisms. There are a few hollow scenes of typical Idiot cops and authorities getting everything wrong in a cliché type way and it has a few filler scenes of that type and a few moments here and there that felt rushed and cheesy. Maybe not everything restored into the Ultimate Edition should have been. I wish there had been more Kevin Costner scenes."

"The whole entire Batman V Superman movie was great and yes even though it felt slow to the majority of the people who watched it but to me I enjoyed every part and every scene of Batman V Superman and when it got to the fight scenes both batman VS Superman and the Doomsday fight it brought so much drama, intensity, and epic performances. So with that being said I give this movie a good 10/10 because it really did go to my expectations and it brought a powerful performance and a powerful yet epic introduction to the upcoming Justice League."

"Zack Snyder not only understands the characters but he also understands how to craft a real amazing movie for fans - honestly blew me away (extended cut) Brilliant!Don't believe what the internet is telling you to think - take this from a person who has worked in the comic book industry - this is amazing!"

"When I first wrote a review for this movie a year ago exclaiming my excitement for the film, I had been high off a fresh dose of live-action DC superheroes playing out the beloved comic book stories that I had grown up on. It was all playing out before my eyes and coming to life. After a few months had passed, I began to notice things about the movie that I disliked: little gaps in the story, things that didn't add up, etc. My original rating of a 10 / 10 dropped to an 8 /10. But today it has gone back up to a 10. The extended version of the film not only rectifies the gaps but also silences critics.Many claimed that the movie was too dark or that it just didn't make sense. To those people, I say: \"Pick up a comic book!\" Many of the critics of this particular film were part of the superhero bandwagon that formed when Marvel began its spree of Avengers-related films. In fact, its estimated that over 60% of people who go to see 'superhero' genre films have never picked up a comic book in their life. I would argue that similar numbers could figure to those which view the CW televised DC Universe shows. People complain that DC comics is just too dark but the fact is that these movies are based upon actual comics which are meant to be dark (ex: The Dark Knight Returns, Injustice, etc.). Its like complaining that Game of Thrones (the TV series) sucks because they kill off too many characters. Read the books! Its frustrating to see such a beautiful work of art like Batman V Superman criticized by those ignorant to its universe and its meaning. This movie is in fact a catalyst that opens numerous doorways and leaves true fans in awe of the possibilities for future movies. But regardless of whether or not people choose to educate themselves, this film's DVD/Blu-ray extended version puts the theater release to shame. All of the plot holes and gaps are filled in 30 minutes of extended footage scattered throughout the film. The movie ultimately becomes more complete and people will wish that the movie had shown the full 3 hours of footage in its theatrical debut. As a major DC comics fan, I will of course pick up on things that a comics fan would not, but someone who does not read comics would learn to appreciate this film in its entirety with the extended version. Get your hands on a copy today or find it on Netflix or the internet somewhere!"

"I ignored the bad reviews and watched anyways. This film had a lot to live up to after Civil War was released and I went into this film expecting the worst. It ended up to be the best Superhero film of 2016 to me. One complaint was that this film was more concerned about universe building than telling a great story than Civil War but for me it was the other way around; Civil War felt like a build up to something else and to be honest, I felt that way when I saw the other MCU films. Batman vs Superman however not only had a great story, but it also felt a lot more consistent than Civil War. This film was way more diverse with the cast than the MCU but unlike the MCU, I felt like this film doesn't go overboard with the SJW stuff like the MCU films or The Star Wars Sequel films do. The Visuals were AMAZING, The Score by Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL was AMAZING as well, The Tone is just right as I actually felt for the characters emotionally, The Cinematography kept my eyes glued to the screen, and the script felt really Intelligent and Complex and despite people calling the writing confusing, I was able to piece it together with no problem whatsoever. This film is similar to Empire Strikes back in terms of popularity so over time after the other movies are released, this movie would probably be more popular.This film was way better than I Expected and deserves another chance.

"Its shame to see what critics and marvel fans did to this movie and targeted Zack Snyder for it. I have seen this movie more than 25 times till date. And i enjoy this movie as much as i enjoyed the first time. The fans who have read DC comics, wouldn't be disappointed in this movie. Its dark movie, yes it is. Because the title shows the intense situation at hand. Two superheroes about to rip each other apart for whatever reasons that brought them to this stage. Yes it had to be dark and intense.Only marvel can be stupid enough to show an alien invasion where humans are loosing the battle and the super heroes are cracking jokes while battles as if they are playing ping pong. a person playing Call of Duty game is more serious while playing than the marvel heroes fighting aliens."

"Last week some news came out from somebody online who had claimed to have seen a finished version of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. If you were like me, you've been leery of checking it out because you weren't sure how much might actually be true. Now Zack Snyder has spoken out about the spoiler-filled post, although his response doesn't really clear anything up.In a word, to MTV, he called the post \"hilarious,which might imply that he's saying that it's mostly, if not entirely, untrue. That might be the case, but then again he could have just said it was untrue and he didn't say that. What he did say, however, is that he doesn't like spoilers. While this may seem odd for the director who's most recent trailer appeared to give away the entire movie, Snyder says that's not the case. Even if you've seen the trailer, you can rest easy, as there is much more we have not seen in then finished film. Says Snyder I have the benefit of seeing the movie. It's cool that think it's too much, and I appreciate people not wanting to know, but there's plenty that they don't know. There's a lot of movie that's not in the trailer. In the process of calling the Batman v Superman Reddit review hilarious, Snyder goes on to talk about how he hates it when spoilers come out. The director would much rather that fans see the movie mostly blind. While he understands that some fans may wish to find the answers before hand, he wants his movies to be mysteries going in. If you're, as an audience member, exploring these articles, looking for answers to questions that you have, maybe you're okay with knowing before you go. It's like an individual taste. But like I said, I want people to see the movie without knowing.Spoilers are a topic that mean different things to different people. While most try to avoid them to some degree, the need to solve the mystery is a nearly universal human experience. We have an inclination to want to know the truth, even while also wanting to be surprised. For most of us getting some information is good, but getting all the information is bad, of course, only getting the details that you want can be difficult."
"The theatrical is choppy, poorly edited, hard to follow, with some really good moments mixed in their. The extended is much more fluent and is much easier to follow, it does have a long runtime, which might make it seem a bit dragging on, but if you like long films done right, like Lord of the Rings, you will like this movie as long as you get into the characters and story. Speaking of which, the story starts out perfectly showing Bruce Wayne as a character, and it is very powerful. There are several moments in this movie that are powerful, emotional, and shocking. Characters. Batman is my favorite fictional character of all time, and believe me when I say, Ben Affleck as Batman was perfect, he had the charisma, the anger, and the look of being through some bad stuff Gal Gadot also does perfect as Wonder Woman, but if you want to really see how good she does, go watch the Wonder Woman movie. Henry Call as Superman. I really don't like it when people say Christopher Reeves is better. Don't get me wrong, Reeves does great, but can you imagine him as Superman in this movie? I wouldn't like it. It would be like Adam West playing Batman in The Dark Knight. Henry Cavill does great in this role, I can say everything about him as I said with Ben Affleck. Jesse Eisenberg as Luthor. I thought it was different in a good way. I've heard a criticism for him as being too much like Joker, but is that a bad thing? Joker is my favorite villain, so to see Superman have an enemy that crazy, but still hold the values Luthor needs to be Luthor, I think it is great. The thing I thought this movie was lacking in the first and second acts was humor, at least good humor. If there was more humor, I would've given this movie a ten because it would give a more relaxing feel to the parts that needed it. All in all though, this movie was awesome, it had powerful moments, it was badass, and just plain fun. It had a great story arc and does its job very well."

"*I will be talking about the Ultimate Edition of the film* This was one of the most anticipated CBM of all time. Ever since the arrival and subsequent success of Marvel's The Avengers people have wondered when will DC launch its own cinematic universe, one of the main reasons being the opportunity to finally see titans such as Batman and Superman share the screen together: the ultimate nerd dream. On 2016, the moment finally came for BvS to be released AND.. it performed poorly. Not only did critical reception left a lot to be desired, but fan reactions where surprisingly split after its cinematic debut. People either loved it and called Zack a genius, or hated it and called him a hack. Me, personally, I found myself with middle of the road feelings, for sure, but more leaning towards the negative side with subsequent viewings. The theatrical cut of the film showcased amazing performances, incredible visuals, and action set pieces that seemed like comic book panels come to life, in a good way. However, when it comes to its narrative structure and more technical aspects like editing, the film was seriously flawed. More plot holes than Age of Ultron, questionable character decisions, random editing that lacked cohesion and focus, and forced dramatic moments that lacked any impact because the attempts at character development ranged from limited to nonexistent, especially when it comes to Superman's character. I thought it was a 5/10 movie at best. As such, I was kind of skeptical about the idea of a 30 minute longer version. I say kind of because I know how Zack works. I remember Watchmen being vastly improved with its director's cut, so in a way I was expecting BvS to perform in a similar manner, but I also feared those 30 minutes wold be just there to amplify action and discredit storytelling issues. Oh boy, I'm so glad I was proved wrong. The ultimate cut of the film was infuriating, but not because it was awful, but because it questions the sanity of WB executives and editors and makes you wonder what were they thinking during the editing process. What I got out of the Ultimate Edition was a thought-provoking deconstruction of two very iconic superheroes that gave spotlight to the struggles both of them face when they aren't fighting crime. What I got was an extremely well produced character study on both Batman and Superman in a cynical world, a world dangerously close to our own. We meet Batman as a ruthless, worn out hero that has seen the failure behind his ideals and witnessed some truly horrifying things in his life. Superman, on the other hand, is portrayed as a godlike figure that seeks to do good in the world, but finds himself emotionally conflicted once he realized that every good deed he does leaves behind a trail of destruction (most of it due to Luthor's antics). In my opinion, this is a hugely original approach, one that distances itself from the rest of the competition and delivers a dark, somber, yet relevant superhero movie that understands both characters and gives them real human struggles to deal with. I felt invested in both of them, and hoped that by the end of the film both could find a way to redeem themselves. Their character arcs were very well established during the first two acts of the movie, and by the time we get to the titular climactic battle the emotion behind the jaw-dropping action is intensified. Lex Luthor as a villain was also given more time to develop with this new edition. One of the main criticisms with the original version was the fact that his plan relied too much on conveniences, and the character's mannerisms and mad-scientist attitude was annoying, and that goes without saying his motivations were unclear. Not only do we spend more time understanding his hate for any godlike figure and thus his hatred for Superman, but the added scenes allowed us to witness his entire plan come to fruition. It sells the cold, manipulative, calculating attributes of his comic counterpart. The acting is spot on. Every actor owns his/her role, from Cavill's Superman, to Ben Affleck as Batman, Eisenberg as Luthor, and Gadot as Wonder Woman, whose scenes are brief, but are more than enough to sell the strong and ferocious warrior that she is. Cinematography is stunning, and miles above that of Man of Steel's. And the soundtrack by Zimmer and Junkie XL? Perfect, just perfect. When it comes to flaws, the film still has some of those. The Martha moment, while serving as a pivotal character moment for Batman, felt off in execution, and its understandable that many people got mad at it. If your main complaint about BvS the first time around was its bleak tone and subject matter, this film is still not for you. I understand most were expecting to see the heroes being the most iconic versions of themselves, clashing in an elongated battle and evoking the same feelings The Avengers gave audiences back in 2012. In that sense, the film will remain divisive, but at least I have the comfort of saying that, at the very least, the film is competently made."

"This film was amazing. Ben Affleck was easily the best part of this movie, he brought his a-game as Batman. The chemistry between Affleck & Irons was outstanding. Gal Gadot did a great job as Wonder Woman. The fight between Batman & Superman was awesome. The final fight with Doomsday was outstanding in every way possible. However, there is only one problem with this film and that's Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor. He was sadly missed cast in this role, but then again it's really the fault of Warner Bros. Studios. Overall, this film deliver on almost every level. I highly recommend that you watch the extended version of this film."

"I know I know. I saw it in theaters too, and felt like it could've been so much better. While the Batman element was good, the narrative felt fractured, and the third act was just one long stunt scene. Superman was relegated to a supporting character, and other characters didn't get a chance to shine. And then I chanced on the ultimate cut. Calling it 30 mins of \"extra\" footage is unfair to Zack Snyder because it's exactly these 30 mins that makes the movie a worthy one. What I can say about the theatrical cut is this - It had the blockbuster elements - music, visuals, stunts, CGI. But, it lacked the human elements. The first 20 mins of the movie had it, but not after that. The extended cut in comparison has a flow to the narrative. There are no disjointed scenes, everything flows smoothly, and there's connective tissue. Superman gets to spend some time with his father, and mother. Clark Kent does some investigative journalism. Superman helps the people after the blast. Lois Lane doesn't jump to conclusions, she gets to the bottom of the crime. Lex Luthor apparently had a coherent plan - everything is explained pretty well. Wonder Woman was already good, so there's no change there :) Also, the \"Martha\" scene seems better executed, because it is a few seconds longer, and there's time to breathe it in. So, here's my take on this movie - The theatrical cut was junk. Get the Bluray for ultimate edition, and you shall not be disappointed. I've seen it so many more times now, and it's the definitive cut. It is the movie we deserve. It's a unique take on Batman, and Superman. It's a gritty take on the superhero movie genre, and definitely the best DCEU movie, and the best DC movie since The Dark Knight.P.S. Yes it's dark. We're adults, and we should appreciate mature film making without intentionally silly moments. It attempts to be philosophical, and something deep instead of just trying to make you chuckle."

"This is one of the best superhero movies ever made. Zack Snyder is a magician behind the camera.The reason behind so many complaints is the fact that Warner Bros. marketed this movie as a fight between Batman and Superman. That's not what it is. It's a movie about the origins of the Justice League.The cinematography, the acting and the score are all second to none. This film is phenomenal.P.S: watch the 3 hour extended cut that Snyder intended you to see, not the 2 and a half hour movie that Warner Bros. decided would be better for theaters."

"I don't care what the critics say, this is a very well-done movie. I'll start my review by listing what I like about the movie.1.) Ben Affleck is the best batman to me and it is not close. He pulls off the role of an aging batman extremely well. Also, Zack Snyder's vision of batman is legit. I have always hated batman up until this adaptation of him. Instead of being a conflicted and idealistic batman, this batman is dark, gritty, and 100% a badass. His equipment is decked out with machine guns and he has no aversion to killing people. In fact, he probably kills about 50 criminal by the time this movie is over. The warehouse scene is the coolest batman scene in any movie.2.) The development of a grudge between batman and superman is pulled off flawlessly. It actually makes sense why batman dislikes superman. Then, when they do fight it is about the coolest thing you can expect to see from a superhero film. 3.) I disagree with a lot of people about Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor. In my opinion, he played his role to perfection. 4.) B v S sets up Wonder Woman and Justice League with Gal Gadot's cameo as Wonder Woman and short clips of Aquaman, the Flash, and Cyborg. B v S is one of my favorite superhero films and rewatching it never gets old."

"The theatrical cut of this film is garbage which is why I rated it eight stars instead of nine. The first time I watched this film I didn't like it (not straight out hate but didn't like). Character motivations didn't make any sense, Lex was annoying as s***, editing was sloppy, and it was overly dark and broody for an action superhero movie. A year + a half, five Marvel films, a ton of bad reviews and a Justice League later a thought popped into my head: \"what if I watched BVS again\". This time I didn't have trailers ruining the best moments, I only vaguely remembered the film, and I was conditioned to look at it negatively but something unexpected happened: I actually loved it. Superman was just a normal person that tried to make a difference cause he could that others imposed their own beliefs on. Lex Luthor was a genius that couldn't stand his powerlessness compared to Superman or more accurately a super being. As Alfred said \"The fever, the rage, the feeling of powerlessness that turns good men... cruel\" and you see the same thought process in Batman. Batman, just like Lex Luthor feels powerless in the midst of a god-being and just like Lex he attempts to destroy him so he can get his sense of power back but unlike Lex, Batman learns something. I what is one of the corniest lines of the movie Superman says, \"Martha\" when he knows he can't win against Batman in a late desperate attempt to save his mother. Not only does this name connect with Bruce Wayne but it also shows what really matters to a man of steel: it isn't power, it isn't fame or anything else, it is his Mother and on a broader scale it is people. Lex (who doesn't care about people at all) knows he doesn't have the power so he creates something from his blood and the remains of Zod: A Doomsday for Superman. Not only does this film have depth but it also doesn't always explain it to you which is rare in a blockbuster action superhero flick normally cater to semi-comic book fans and people that want to shove popcorn in their mouths. This film rewards you for really noticing the details while still having massive explosions. One of my favorites is how Lex has all of Batman's branded killed which is why he isn't afraid of the branding at the end or Grandma's Peach Tea as a way of scaring the s*** out of someone. Of course, this film isn't perfect and I do have personal dislikes. The Batman V Superman fight was slow and pretty boring especially after watching such an amazing fight in Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 2 (If you haven't watched the animated Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 1 and 2 you are sorely missing out on something fantastic). Also, the addition of Wonder Woman who pretty much steals a hacker thing, gives it back and then suits up and fights against a giant monster thing. Not to say I don't like Wonder Woman (She is one of my favorite Superheroes of all time who showed not only can woman kick a** but they also don't need to be ashamed of their sexuality or gender) but she wasn't really that helpful to the plot and just brought in to expand the universe which was well done through Lex's superhuman hunting files. Also, the post-apocalyptic scene that was just a dream could have been cut but nothing is perfect except movies like Citizen Kane which isn't a lot of fun to watch cause it is too perfect. So to summarize, the theatrical cut is bad, the ultimate cut is Amazing and the other cut is meh. Please give it a second chance because it deserves it and save a good director from losing grace because of something he didn't do."
"I really liked it, don't know what all the hate is about. I'm actually a Marvel fan from when I was 7 or so, but Superman and Batman together in 1 movie? Just great. And personally I like Ben Affleck even better than Christian Bale as Batman. So just watch and enjoy, I know I did!"

"That's right. We have been waiting for these two heroes to finally meet and fight against each other. This movie is so good in both plot and special effects.Henry Cavill and Ben Affleck have performed well in their acting stages. They are the best superhero actors and they have filmed their fighting scenes very well. The movie starts to show the conflict between the lives of the heroes and now they have blamed each other for it. This movie is amazing and sets up a good plot for Dawn Justice."

"Actually...I didn't know what to expect. When you see Wonder Woman, you know it will be off of Wonder Woman and off of a Wonder Woman story, but with Batman V Superman, I was like, \"hmmmm, so who is this about?\" It was pretty obvious that it would feature many characters, but I thought the introduction to Batman was amazing. Ben Affleck nailed the part, not only as Batman but also as Bruce Wayne. He is my Batman. Henry Cavill continued to be super as the Man of Steel. And he is my Super - Man. A dark story? Yes, without a doubt. Could it have had a few more jokes? Sure. But not all movies or stories need to have jokes when certain events are serious. I really hope people can see this review and take another look at the movie, because, I loved it. I really hope the ratings can go up, eventually. And P.S, this movie is the perfect set up to Justice League."

"I'll start by making it clear I have only ever seen the Ultimate Edition. I'm aware of what was cut out for the theatrical release, so I will concede up front that most of the criticisms about pacing, editing, and missing bits of plot at release were merited.With that caveat out of the way, I must reiterate that this was bar-none the boldest superhero movie I have ever seen. To me, it was arguably the best as well, though \"best\" shouldn't be taken to mean \"most enjoyable.\" That honor easily goes to \"Thor: Ragnarok.\" What makes BvS stand out among other films in the genre is that it takes two characters who have been done to death since the 1970s and brings them up to date. I recently tried to watch \"Superman: The Movie\" for the first time in a number of years, and while it was still good and Reeves will always be iconic, I just couldn't take it seriously. I'll put it this way: If the story in BvS was \"stupid\" in your view but Superman turning back time by spinning the earth backward on its axis didn't seem like one of the dumbest things you have ever seen -in any movie from any genre- to the extent that it outright ruins the movie for you, then your opinion about BvS isn't worth much. Nostalgic bias was always going to be a problem for this movie, and the way people reacted to and reviewed \"Man of Steel\" was telling in this regard.That brings me to Zack Snyder's take on Superman. You know, that guy whose status as the first extraterrestrial ever encountered by humanity was a total non-issue in the old movies. Apparently, Snyder has a similar view to my own in that his take on the Man of Steel makes his being an alien a core piece of his identity. He may look like any other (absurdly attractive) person, but he knows what he is, and that makes him perpetually uncertain of where he fits in this world. He is essentially good and really does care about people, but he struggles to truly empathize with the likes of us. To be human is to be frail, and that is not something he can easily relate to. This is the root of his conflict with Batman.Just as Clark struggles to genuinely relate to most people, Snyder's Batman either refuses to or otherwise just can't relate to Superman. He doesn't see him as anything but a threat regardless of Superman's clear good intentions. Remember, a small group of Kryptonians were able to bring humanity to the brink of extinction in less than a day, and Bruce Wayne is nothing if not a realist. He didn't know the guy from Kansas. He only knew the god from another world.While Batman's anger toward and fear of Superman are readily apparent from the start, Superman's inability to imagine things from Bruce Wayne's perspective only becomes truly apparent during their first real interaction. This reminded me of the animated version of the \"world's finest\" storyline, where Superman judges Batman harshly for using fear tactics and threats of violence (also, actual violence) to get the job done. Superman wasn't willing to consider what it would take for a human man to fight criminals and save innocents, or what that life would do to him over time. Just as Batman didn't see the guy from Kansas, Superman didn't see the man who lives his life trapped in one brutal, unthinkably traumatic moment (this was beautifully conveyed during the film's opening moments), and had spent his whole adult life bearing witness to humanity at its absolute worst.The conflict between these two characters is as old as human history. They want the same things, but they can't understand one another. So they fight. And what a fight it was.Watching a fight between, say, Captain America and Iron Man was, to me, more frustrating than anything because each understood the other's perspective perfectly. The fight between Batman and Superman in BvS was genuinely gut-wrenching, as intended, because they would have understood one another if either had tried. The whole sequence hilighted Batman's tactical prowess and ability to control a situation. Maybe the most badass thing about the fight was that it ended exactly where Batman planned. That brings me to the big elephant in the room named \"Martha.\"I can't recall exactly which YouTuber put it this way, but if you thought the \"save Martha\" exchange was about their mothers having the same name, you had your brain turned off. The brain-on people have explained this to death, but it bears repeating. This was the moment when Superman became humanized to Batman. He was about to die, and his only concern was for his adoptive human mother. He still believed that the man about to take his life would do the right thing. Even with the cowl on, there was no mistaking the look on Batman's face. It was the look of shame, guilt, and sudden uncertainty that says \"What am I doing?\" Turns out even the most brutal, angry version of Bruce Wayne is better than Tony Stark at knowing right from wrong. At knowing that he had gone too far.From there, the third act was a series of truly impressive (albeit mostly CGI) fight sequences, beginning with what I regard as the undisputed champion of Batman fights. Nothing in the Nolan movies (and especially nothing in the Burton movies) even came close. Go ahead, try to convince yourself that Batman and Bane taking turns punching one another in the face until Bane's mask broke was a good fight sequence. No, this was a fight straight out of \"Arkham Knight,\" and it was glorious. The battle against Doomsday really was one for the books. From the moment Wonder Woman arrived accompanied by the intense sounds of Tina Guo's electric cello to Superman's tragic, heroic death at the hands of Doomsday, I was glued to the screen. Sure, the mere presence of Doomsday spoiled the end to a degree, but watching the Man of Steel laboring to carry that kryptonite spear towards certain death was no less impactful. A brief word on Jesse Eisenberg's take on Lex Luthor. At least one other reviewer on this site already said it best when they pointed out that this was his origin story. If you consider his scheme objectively, he is actually one of the more formidable incarnations of the character. If we're lucky, we'll eventually get to see a Snyder Cut of \"Justice League\" and find out where this story was actually meant to go. For the record, Joss Whedon and Danny Elfman both should have said \"no\" to taking a dump on someone else's art."
"BATMAN V SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE brings a fantastic surprise to a smash-hit team-up with one of the worlds most beloved DC Comics' icons of all time. The movie delivers spectacular casting, and fantastic acting with different characters having their shine in each scenes.The story follows Clark Kent/Superman who becomes a threat, after the destruction in Metropolis in Man Of Steel.(2013). Batman/Bruce Wayne sees him as a threat and begins his war on Superman.The movie brings spectacular storytelling, it tells the complications of human against alien who are on the same side, and the first meeting of Batman and Superman. The story of Bruce Wayne, with his many years of The Caped Crusader, sends him on a spiral of \"out of control\", sheer anger, and builds tension to wanting to defeat the Man of Steel. Snyder has fantastically gave this storytelling an exciting nod to the comics.Lex Luthor, played by Jesse Einsberg, delivers a very interesting performance, but very differently by him showing is his \"origin\" before he becomes a bald foe to the Man of Steel. He shows that his love of \"god vs man\" terrorises mankind when he ultimately creates Doomsday, and Batman realises Superman's inner heroism.It packs so many great \"out of nowhere\" excitement, including a first-look of the fearful Wonder Woman a.k.a. Diana Prince, played by Gal Gadot, and a fresh-new glimpse of the superhero DC canon: The Justice League.WATCH THIS MOVIE! The critics are out of their mind. It's a fun-packed action adventure which still keeps the movie enjoyable until it's final minutes of the movie. It's a FANTASTIC MOVIE! BEN AFFLECK AS BATMAN... is Incredible!A 10/10 overall!"
"I want to go on record as saying that this is a truly thrilling cinematic experience in so many ways. If pressed, I guess I could acknowledge that there were a couple ... let's say \"clumsy\" moments. And in a film that runs to three hours, that hardly seems like a significant issue, certainly not enough to rate it with fewer than 9 stars.This film has everything. There is dramatic tension right from the start. There is a magnificent story arc that picks up quite seamlessly from 'Man of Steel' and propels the viewer not only into the life of Clark Kent/Superman but also of Bruce Wayne/Batman.The villain is no mere cartoon of a villain; he is truly thoroughly (and apparently irrevocably) diabolical. He is a psychopath, and you wish for his death over and over and over. You want Superman to reduce him to ash with the power of his eyes.I have read a number of viewers' reviews, and it seems that the people who disliked the film / gave it a low rating had rather unfair and unrealistic expectations of it. That is, their own prejudices about how the plot could/should unfold or what the character development could/should be, etc. ruined the film for them. And that is a shame.My thought is: I settle into my seat, wait for the lights to dim, and then I wait to be transported by the film. I accept it, lock, stock, and barrel.As another reviewer remarked, I love how the film begins from the point of view of Bruce Wayne as he is among people on the ground who have fallen victim to the attack of Zod and the other Kryptonians.Why would Bruce Wayne not like Superman? Why would the good people of Earth hurl insults at Superman and burn him in effigy (on the news)? Because the good people of Earth just got catapulted into a new reality in which there are not only extraterrestrial beings (surprise!) but they are also superman! And a group of them are hell-bent on destroying humankind and taking the planet for themselves.It is difficult to see Superman as separate from the whole Kryptonian Krew.It seems that many moviegoers forgot that Bruce Wayne is also human. Sure, he's a hero, but he is flawed.. Just like the rest of us. He is a vigilante, after all.He has let his vigilantism get the better of him. HE is actually the one working outside the boundaries of the law, not Superman. It is the clear head of Alfred that shows us that he has gone into a rather dark place, that he has not seen what is really going on (in Luthor's scheme), and so he chooses to embark on his own scheme scheme to take out the alien invader. He is (allegedly) thinking of the future: if he wipes out the all-powerful alien, then it can't turn on humankind in the future. At least, he convinces himself of that.A philosophical question is raised in the film: should Clark Kent have remained a simple man from Kansas and never have become the Superman? Should he just let people die and let calamities happen? The question is answered for us in the character of Diana Prince/Wonder Woman. She withdrew from mankind (her exact words) and just sat around watching. Watching while people died horrible deaths all around her. So, should Superman have done the same? Do these special beings, these 'metahumans', have some kind of moral imperative to intervene, or should they be allowed to be regular people, too? It seems that humans want it both ways.It seems that humans are saying: \"Don't be a superalien ... except when I and my friends and family are in trouble. Then come save us.\""

"Batman v Superman: Ultimate Edition: If your looking for a quick, cheap thrill then you might not enjoy this film at the time. This movies theatrical version was butchered by WB and in doing so reshaped the story leaving numerous plot holes. So the Ultimate Edition is the full story and the one worth seeing. Watch 'Man of Steel' before seeing this movie. There is much to claw through here, so much so that the audience might easily find themselves exhausted from the overall aggression of the film. However, a lot of the story does work. The action is good, and the emotion feels real most of the time.This film is about Superman trying to become Superman. Trying to help the world, save people, find a place in this world not as an outcast, and yet is looked at has a threat by many. Superman is not from this world, yet He is trying to be human, find a place in this world, be excepted by earths people, and come into his destiny.This film is also about Batman being Batman for 20 years and losing faith in humanity, and fearing Superman, what Superman can do with his powers. Great film, great plot, great visuals. ---Yidioo"
"I didn't see the film in the theaters and just bought the \"Extended Edition \" on Amazon. I never properly saw Man of Steel- i think I rented it and watched it when already exhausted and fell asleep. I saw the mediocre user reviews and horrible reviews from critics of this film.They really have it wrong. This is the very best either Batman or Superman. It has a different take, on things. Much darker then earlier films even darker then the Christopher Nolan Batman films.First of all Christopher Nolan is an Executive Producer. So how bad could it be? I loved Sucker Punch and Zack Snyder was involved with that. So how bad could this be? Hans Zimmer did the music, so how bad could it be?I remember watching the old Superman TV shows and reading the Superman and Batman comics as a little kid and loved them, but i wouldn't call myself a \"fan boy\" of comic universes, like so many younger people today. As an older adult I will admit my favorite TV show of all time was Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but watched it on DVD only after it had finished. I saw the second of the Dark Knight series in the theater, but the other two, I watched on DVD. They were great, but not my favorite films like so many people. i also loved the first couple Superman and Batman films in the older series. Regardless, i was not waiting with baited breath to see Man of Steel or this one.I'm more of a serious film fan, who can watch Stanley Kubrick films over and over and my favorite films in the last twenty years, are Eyes Wide Shut and Intersteller, both of which i've watched multiple times.So, with that said, take it from me, the critics have this film very wrong, just as critics hated 2001: A Space Odyssey when it first came out. This film will have lasting appreciation.Surprised how much I liked Ben Afleck's Batman. it was hard to get into Henry Cavil's scrawnier looking Superman, but it grew on me. Amy Adams was great as Lois Lane, The Gal Gadol Wonder Women was amazing. Lex Luther was terrific, like Nolan's Joker. Jeremy Irons was the best Alfred ever. Holly Hunter and Diane Lane was good too. The movie had bad reviews but made a billion dollars. Hopefully everyone buys the Ultimate Edition and it breaks sales records and the film is re-appreciated. I have no idea what scenes this Ultimate Edition added, but it is pretty perfect. Now I can't wait for Wonder Woman and the Justice League and as soon as I finish writing this am going to watch Man of Steal. I'm into it now!I can only surmise that the bad reviews stem from too much expectations of the rigid fan boy types and the radical changes in tone, we see in this film.Total masterpiece of cinema, but I have a few criticisms. There are a few hollow scenes of typical Idiot cops and authorities getting everything wrong in a cliché type way and it has a few filler scenes of that type and a few moments here and there that felt rushed and cheesy. Maybe not everything restored into the Ultimate Edition should have been. I wish there had been more Kevin Costner scenes."

"The whole entire Batman V Superman movie was great and yes even though it felt slow to the majority of the people who watched it but to me I enjoyed every part and every scene of Batman V Superman and when it got to the fight scenes both batman VS Superman and the Doomsday fight it brought so much drama, intensity, and epic performances. So with that being said I give this movie a good 10/10 because it really did go to my expectations and it brought a powerful performance and a powerful yet epic introduction to the upcoming Justice League."

"Zack Snyder not only understands the characters but he also understands how to craft a real amazing movie for fans - honestly blew me away (extended cut) Brilliant!Don't believe what the internet is telling you to think - take this from a person who has worked in the comic book industry - this is amazing!"

"When I first wrote a review for this movie a year ago exclaiming my excitement for the film, I had been high off a fresh dose of live-action DC superheroes playing out the beloved comic book stories that I had grown up on. It was all playing out before my eyes and coming to life. After a few months had passed, I began to notice things about the movie that I disliked: little gaps in the story, things that didn't add up, etc. My original rating of a 10 / 10 dropped to an 8 /10. But today it has gone back up to a 10. The extended version of the film not only rectifies the gaps but also silences critics.Many claimed that the movie was too dark or that it just didn't make sense. To those people, I say: \"Pick up a comic book!\" Many of the critics of this particular film were part of the superhero bandwagon that formed when Marvel began its spree of Avengers-related films. In fact, its estimated that over 60% of people who go to see 'superhero' genre films have never picked up a comic book in their life. I would argue that similar numbers could figure to those which view the CW televised DC Universe shows. People complain that DC comics is just too dark but the fact is that these movies are based upon actual comics which are meant to be dark (ex: The Dark Knight Returns, Injustice, etc.). Its like complaining that Game of Thrones (the TV series) sucks because they kill off too many characters. Read the books! Its frustrating to see such a beautiful work of art like Batman V Superman criticized by those ignorant to its universe and its meaning. This movie is in fact a catalyst that opens numerous doorways and leaves true fans in awe of the possibilities for future movies. But regardless of whether or not people choose to educate themselves, this film's DVD/Blu-ray extended version puts the theater release to shame. All of the plot holes and gaps are filled in 30 minutes of extended footage scattered throughout the film. The movie ultimately becomes more complete and people will wish that the movie had shown the full 3 hours of footage in its theatrical debut. As a major DC comics fan, I will of course pick up on things that a comics fan would not, but someone who does not read comics would learn to appreciate this film in its entirety with the extended version. Get your hands on a copy today or find it on Netflix or the internet somewhere!"

"I ignored the bad reviews and watched anyways. This film had a lot to live up to after Civil War was released and I went into this film expecting the worst. It ended up to be the best Superhero film of 2016 to me. One complaint was that this film was more concerned about universe building than telling a great story than Civil War but for me it was the other way around; Civil War felt like a build up to something else and to be honest, I felt that way when I saw the other MCU films. Batman vs Superman however not only had a great story, but it also felt a lot more consistent than Civil War. This film was way more diverse with the cast than the MCU but unlike the MCU, I felt like this film doesn't go overboard with the SJW stuff like the MCU films or The Star Wars Sequel films do. The Visuals were AMAZING, The Score by Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL was AMAZING as well, The Tone is just right as I actually felt for the characters emotionally, The Cinematography kept my eyes glued to the screen, and the script felt really Intelligent and Complex and despite people calling the writing confusing, I was able to piece it together with no problem whatsoever. This film is similar to Empire Strikes back in terms of popularity so over time after the other movies are released, this movie would probably be more popular.This film was way better than I Expected and deserves another chance.

"Its shame to see what critics and marvel fans did to this movie and targeted Zack Snyder for it. I have seen this movie more than 25 times till date. And i enjoy this movie as much as i enjoyed the first time. The fans who have read DC comics, wouldn't be disappointed in this movie. Its dark movie, yes it is. Because the title shows the intense situation at hand. Two superheroes about to rip each other apart for whatever reasons that brought them to this stage. Yes it had to be dark and intense.Only marvel can be stupid enough to show an alien invasion where humans are loosing the battle and the super heroes are cracking jokes while battles as if they are playing ping pong. a person playing Call of Duty game is more serious while playing than the marvel heroes fighting aliens."

"Last week some news came out from somebody online who had claimed to have seen a finished version of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. If you were like me, you've been leery of checking it out because you weren't sure how much might actually be true. Now Zack Snyder has spoken out about the spoiler-filled post, although his response doesn't really clear anything up.In a word, to MTV, he called the post \"hilarious,which might imply that he's saying that it's mostly, if not entirely, untrue. That might be the case, but then again he could have just said it was untrue and he didn't say that. What he did say, however, is that he doesn't like spoilers. While this may seem odd for the director who's most recent trailer appeared to give away the entire movie, Snyder says that's not the case. Even if you've seen the trailer, you can rest easy, as there is much more we have not seen in then finished film. Says Snyder I have the benefit of seeing the movie. It's cool that think it's too much, and I appreciate people not wanting to know, but there's plenty that they don't know. There's a lot of movie that's not in the trailer. In the process of calling the Batman v Superman Reddit review hilarious, Snyder goes on to talk about how he hates it when spoilers come out. The director would much rather that fans see the movie mostly blind. While he understands that some fans may wish to find the answers before hand, he wants his movies to be mysteries going in. If you're, as an audience member, exploring these articles, looking for answers to questions that you have, maybe you're okay with knowing before you go. It's like an individual taste. But like I said, I want people to see the movie without knowing.Spoilers are a topic that mean different things to different people. While most try to avoid them to some degree, the need to solve the mystery is a nearly universal human experience. We have an inclination to want to know the truth, even while also wanting to be surprised. For most of us getting some information is good, but getting all the information is bad, of course, only getting the details that you want can be difficult."
"The theatrical is choppy, poorly edited, hard to follow, with some really good moments mixed in their. The extended is much more fluent and is much easier to follow, it does have a long runtime, which might make it seem a bit dragging on, but if you like long films done right, like Lord of the Rings, you will like this movie as long as you get into the characters and story. Speaking of which, the story starts out perfectly showing Bruce Wayne as a character, and it is very powerful. There are several moments in this movie that are powerful, emotional, and shocking. Characters. Batman is my favorite fictional character of all time, and believe me when I say, Ben Affleck as Batman was perfect, he had the charisma, the anger, and the look of being through some bad stuff Gal Gadot also does perfect as Wonder Woman, but if you want to really see how good she does, go watch the Wonder Woman movie. Henry Call as Superman. I really don't like it when people say Christopher Reeves is better. Don't get me wrong, Reeves does great, but can you imagine him as Superman in this movie? I wouldn't like it. It would be like Adam West playing Batman in The Dark Knight. Henry Cavill does great in this role, I can say everything about him as I said with Ben Affleck. Jesse Eisenberg as Luthor. I thought it was different in a good way. I've heard a criticism for him as being too much like Joker, but is that a bad thing? Joker is my favorite villain, so to see Superman have an enemy that crazy, but still hold the values Luthor needs to be Luthor, I think it is great. The thing I thought this movie was lacking in the first and second acts was humor, at least good humor. If there was more humor, I would've given this movie a ten because it would give a more relaxing feel to the parts that needed it. All in all though, this movie was awesome, it had powerful moments, it was badass, and just plain fun. It had a great story arc and does its job very well."

"*I will be talking about the Ultimate Edition of the film* This was one of the most anticipated CBM of all time. Ever since the arrival and subsequent success of Marvel's The Avengers people have wondered when will DC launch its own cinematic universe, one of the main reasons being the opportunity to finally see titans such as Batman and Superman share the screen together: the ultimate nerd dream. On 2016, the moment finally came for BvS to be released AND.. it performed poorly. Not only did critical reception left a lot to be desired, but fan reactions where surprisingly split after its cinematic debut. People either loved it and called Zack a genius, or hated it and called him a hack. Me, personally, I found myself with middle of the road feelings, for sure, but more leaning towards the negative side with subsequent viewings. The theatrical cut of the film showcased amazing performances, incredible visuals, and action set pieces that seemed like comic book panels come to life, in a good way. However, when it comes to its narrative structure and more technical aspects like editing, the film was seriously flawed. More plot holes than Age of Ultron, questionable character decisions, random editing that lacked cohesion and focus, and forced dramatic moments that lacked any impact because the attempts at character development ranged from limited to nonexistent, especially when it comes to Superman's character. I thought it was a 5/10 movie at best. As such, I was kind of skeptical about the idea of a 30 minute longer version. I say kind of because I know how Zack works. I remember Watchmen being vastly improved with its director's cut, so in a way I was expecting BvS to perform in a similar manner, but I also feared those 30 minutes wold be just there to amplify action and discredit storytelling issues. Oh boy, I'm so glad I was proved wrong. The ultimate cut of the film was infuriating, but not because it was awful, but because it questions the sanity of WB executives and editors and makes you wonder what were they thinking during the editing process. What I got out of the Ultimate Edition was a thought-provoking deconstruction of two very iconic superheroes that gave spotlight to the struggles both of them face when they aren't fighting crime. What I got was an extremely well produced character study on both Batman and Superman in a cynical world, a world dangerously close to our own. We meet Batman as a ruthless, worn out hero that has seen the failure behind his ideals and witnessed some truly horrifying things in his life. Superman, on the other hand, is portrayed as a godlike figure that seeks to do good in the world, but finds himself emotionally conflicted once he realized that every good deed he does leaves behind a trail of destruction (most of it due to Luthor's antics). In my opinion, this is a hugely original approach, one that distances itself from the rest of the competition and delivers a dark, somber, yet relevant superhero movie that understands both characters and gives them real human struggles to deal with. I felt invested in both of them, and hoped that by the end of the film both could find a way to redeem themselves. Their character arcs were very well established during the first two acts of the movie, and by the time we get to the titular climactic battle the emotion behind the jaw-dropping action is intensified. Lex Luthor as a villain was also given more time to develop with this new edition. One of the main criticisms with the original version was the fact that his plan relied too much on conveniences, and the character's mannerisms and mad-scientist attitude was annoying, and that goes without saying his motivations were unclear. Not only do we spend more time understanding his hate for any godlike figure and thus his hatred for Superman, but the added scenes allowed us to witness his entire plan come to fruition. It sells the cold, manipulative, calculating attributes of his comic counterpart. The acting is spot on. Every actor owns his/her role, from Cavill's Superman, to Ben Affleck as Batman, Eisenberg as Luthor, and Gadot as Wonder Woman, whose scenes are brief, but are more than enough to sell the strong and ferocious warrior that she is. Cinematography is stunning, and miles above that of Man of Steel's. And the soundtrack by Zimmer and Junkie XL? Perfect, just perfect. When it comes to flaws, the film still has some of those. The Martha moment, while serving as a pivotal character moment for Batman, felt off in execution, and its understandable that many people got mad at it. If your main complaint about BvS the first time around was its bleak tone and subject matter, this film is still not for you. I understand most were expecting to see the heroes being the most iconic versions of themselves, clashing in an elongated battle and evoking the same feelings The Avengers gave audiences back in 2012. In that sense, the film will remain divisive, but at least I have the comfort of saying that, at the very least, the film is competently made."

"This film was amazing. Ben Affleck was easily the best part of this movie, he brought his a-game as Batman. The chemistry between Affleck & Irons was outstanding. Gal Gadot did a great job as Wonder Woman. The fight between Batman & Superman was awesome. The final fight with Doomsday was outstanding in every way possible. However, there is only one problem with this film and that's Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor. He was sadly missed cast in this role, but then again it's really the fault of Warner Bros. Studios. Overall, this film deliver on almost every level. I highly recommend that you watch the extended version of this film."

"I know I know. I saw it in theaters too, and felt like it could've been so much better. While the Batman element was good, the narrative felt fractured, and the third act was just one long stunt scene. Superman was relegated to a supporting character, and other characters didn't get a chance to shine. And then I chanced on the ultimate cut. Calling it 30 mins of \"extra\" footage is unfair to Zack Snyder because it's exactly these 30 mins that makes the movie a worthy one. What I can say about the theatrical cut is this - It had the blockbuster elements - music, visuals, stunts, CGI. But, it lacked the human elements. The first 20 mins of the movie had it, but not after that. The extended cut in comparison has a flow to the narrative. There are no disjointed scenes, everything flows smoothly, and there's connective tissue. Superman gets to spend some time with his father, and mother. Clark Kent does some investigative journalism. Superman helps the people after the blast. Lois Lane doesn't jump to conclusions, she gets to the bottom of the crime. Lex Luthor apparently had a coherent plan - everything is explained pretty well. Wonder Woman was already good, so there's no change there :) Also, the \"Martha\" scene seems better executed, because it is a few seconds longer, and there's time to breathe it in. So, here's my take on this movie - The theatrical cut was junk. Get the Bluray for ultimate edition, and you shall not be disappointed. I've seen it so many more times now, and it's the definitive cut. It is the movie we deserve. It's a unique take on Batman, and Superman. It's a gritty take on the superhero movie genre, and definitely the best DCEU movie, and the best DC movie since The Dark Knight.P.S. Yes it's dark. We're adults, and we should appreciate mature film making without intentionally silly moments. It attempts to be philosophical, and something deep instead of just trying to make you chuckle."

"This is one of the best superhero movies ever made. Zack Snyder is a magician behind the camera.The reason behind so many complaints is the fact that Warner Bros. marketed this movie as a fight between Batman and Superman. That's not what it is. It's a movie about the origins of the Justice League.The cinematography, the acting and the score are all second to none. This film is phenomenal.P.S: watch the 3 hour extended cut that Snyder intended you to see, not the 2 and a half hour movie that Warner Bros. decided would be better for theaters."

"I don't care what the critics say, this is a very well-done movie. I'll start my review by listing what I like about the movie.1.) Ben Affleck is the best batman to me and it is not close. He pulls off the role of an aging batman extremely well. Also, Zack Snyder's vision of batman is legit. I have always hated batman up until this adaptation of him. Instead of being a conflicted and idealistic batman, this batman is dark, gritty, and 100% a badass. His equipment is decked out with machine guns and he has no aversion to killing people. In fact, he probably kills about 50 criminal by the time this movie is over. The warehouse scene is the coolest batman scene in any movie.2.) The development of a grudge between batman and superman is pulled off flawlessly. It actually makes sense why batman dislikes superman. Then, when they do fight it is about the coolest thing you can expect to see from a superhero film. 3.) I disagree with a lot of people about Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor. In my opinion, he played his role to perfection. 4.) B v S sets up Wonder Woman and Justice League with Gal Gadot's cameo as Wonder Woman and short clips of Aquaman, the Flash, and Cyborg. B v S is one of my favorite superhero films and rewatching it never gets old."

"The theatrical cut of this film is garbage which is why I rated it eight stars instead of nine. The first time I watched this film I didn't like it (not straight out hate but didn't like). Character motivations didn't make any sense, Lex was annoying as s***, editing was sloppy, and it was overly dark and broody for an action superhero movie. A year + a half, five Marvel films, a ton of bad reviews and a Justice League later a thought popped into my head: \"what if I watched BVS again\". This time I didn't have trailers ruining the best moments, I only vaguely remembered the film, and I was conditioned to look at it negatively but something unexpected happened: I actually loved it. Superman was just a normal person that tried to make a difference cause he could that others imposed their own beliefs on. Lex Luthor was a genius that couldn't stand his powerlessness compared to Superman or more accurately a super being. As Alfred said \"The fever, the rage, the feeling of powerlessness that turns good men... cruel\" and you see the same thought process in Batman. Batman, just like Lex Luthor feels powerless in the midst of a god-being and just like Lex he attempts to destroy him so he can get his sense of power back but unlike Lex, Batman learns something. I what is one of the corniest lines of the movie Superman says, \"Martha\" when he knows he can't win against Batman in a late desperate attempt to save his mother. Not only does this name connect with Bruce Wayne but it also shows what really matters to a man of steel: it isn't power, it isn't fame or anything else, it is his Mother and on a broader scale it is people. Lex (who doesn't care about people at all) knows he doesn't have the power so he creates something from his blood and the remains of Zod: A Doomsday for Superman. Not only does this film have depth but it also doesn't always explain it to you which is rare in a blockbuster action superhero flick normally cater to semi-comic book fans and people that want to shove popcorn in their mouths. This film rewards you for really noticing the details while still having massive explosions. One of my favorites is how Lex has all of Batman's branded killed which is why he isn't afraid of the branding at the end or Grandma's Peach Tea as a way of scaring the s*** out of someone. Of course, this film isn't perfect and I do have personal dislikes. The Batman V Superman fight was slow and pretty boring especially after watching such an amazing fight in Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 2 (If you haven't watched the animated Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 1 and 2 you are sorely missing out on something fantastic). Also, the addition of Wonder Woman who pretty much steals a hacker thing, gives it back and then suits up and fights against a giant monster thing. Not to say I don't like Wonder Woman (She is one of my favorite Superheroes of all time who showed not only can woman kick a** but they also don't need to be ashamed of their sexuality or gender) but she wasn't really that helpful to the plot and just brought in to expand the universe which was well done through Lex's superhuman hunting files. Also, the post-apocalyptic scene that was just a dream could have been cut but nothing is perfect except movies like Citizen Kane which isn't a lot of fun to watch cause it is too perfect. So to summarize, the theatrical cut is bad, the ultimate cut is Amazing and the other cut is meh. Please give it a second chance because it deserves it and save a good director from losing grace because of something he didn't do."
"I really liked it, don't know what all the hate is about. I'm actually a Marvel fan from when I was 7 or so, but Superman and Batman together in 1 movie? Just great. And personally I like Ben Affleck even better than Christian Bale as Batman. So just watch and enjoy, I know I did!"

"That's right. We have been waiting for these two heroes to finally meet and fight against each other. This movie is so good in both plot and special effects.Henry Cavill and Ben Affleck have performed well in their acting stages. They are the best superhero actors and they have filmed their fighting scenes very well. The movie starts to show the conflict between the lives of the heroes and now they have blamed each other for it. This movie is amazing and sets up a good plot for Dawn Justice."

"Actually...I didn't know what to expect. When you see Wonder Woman, you know it will be off of Wonder Woman and off of a Wonder Woman story, but with Batman V Superman, I was like, \"hmmmm, so who is this about?\" It was pretty obvious that it would feature many characters, but I thought the introduction to Batman was amazing. Ben Affleck nailed the part, not only as Batman but also as Bruce Wayne. He is my Batman. Henry Cavill continued to be super as the Man of Steel. And he is my Super - Man. A dark story? Yes, without a doubt. Could it have had a few more jokes? Sure. But not all movies or stories need to have jokes when certain events are serious. I really hope people can see this review and take another look at the movie, because, I loved it. I really hope the ratings can go up, eventually. And P.S, this movie is the perfect set up to Justice League."

"This film is crucial to the extended universe that DC is trying to build, but it feels highly derivative of better stories and continues to demonstrate the misuse of the iconic characters mentioned in the title. Plus Jesse Eisenberg feels wildly mis-casted."

"I'll start by making it clear I have only ever seen the Ultimate Edition. I'm aware of what was cut out for the theatrical release, so I will concede up front that most of the criticisms about pacing, editing, and missing bits of plot at release were merited.With that caveat out of the way, I must reiterate that this was bar-none the boldest superhero movie I have ever seen. To me, it was arguably the best as well, though \"best\" shouldn't be taken to mean \"most enjoyable.\" That honor easily goes to \"Thor: Ragnarok.\" What makes BvS stand out among other films in the genre is that it takes two characters who have been done to death since the 1970s and brings them up to date. I recently tried to watch \"Superman: The Movie\" for the first time in a number of years, and while it was still good and Reeves will always be iconic, I just couldn't take it seriously. I'll put it this way: If the story in BvS was \"stupid\" in your view but Superman turning back time by spinning the earth backward on its axis didn't seem like one of the dumbest things you have ever seen -in any movie from any genre- to the extent that it outright ruins the movie for you, then your opinion about BvS isn't worth much. Nostalgic bias was always going to be a problem for this movie, and the way people reacted to and reviewed \"Man of Steel\" was telling in this regard.That brings me to Zack Snyder's take on Superman. You know, that guy whose status as the first extraterrestrial ever encountered by humanity was a total non-issue in the old movies. Apparently, Snyder has a similar view to my own in that his take on the Man of Steel makes his being an alien a core piece of his identity. He may look like any other (absurdly attractive) person, but he knows what he is, and that makes him perpetually uncertain of where he fits in this world. He is essentially good and really does care about people, but he struggles to truly empathize with the likes of us. To be human is to be frail, and that is not something he can easily relate to. This is the root of his conflict with Batman.Just as Clark struggles to genuinely relate to most people, Snyder's Batman either refuses to or otherwise just can't relate to Superman. He doesn't see him as anything but a threat regardless of Superman's clear good intentions. Remember, a small group of Kryptonians were able to bring humanity to the brink of extinction in less than a day, and Bruce Wayne is nothing if not a realist. He didn't know the guy from Kansas. He only knew the god from another world.While Batman's anger toward and fear of Superman are readily apparent from the start, Superman's inability to imagine things from Bruce Wayne's perspective only becomes truly apparent during their first real interaction. This reminded me of the animated version of the \"world's finest\" storyline, where Superman judges Batman harshly for using fear tactics and threats of violence (also, actual violence) to get the job done. Superman wasn't willing to consider what it would take for a human man to fight criminals and save innocents, or what that life would do to him over time. Just as Batman didn't see the guy from Kansas, Superman didn't see the man who lives his life trapped in one brutal, unthinkably traumatic moment (this was beautifully conveyed during the film's opening moments), and had spent his whole adult life bearing witness to humanity at its absolute worst.The conflict between these two characters is as old as human history. They want the same things, but they can't understand one another. So they fight. And what a fight it was.Watching a fight between, say, Captain America and Iron Man was, to me, more frustrating than anything because each understood the other's perspective perfectly. The fight between Batman and Superman in BvS was genuinely gut-wrenching, as intended, because they would have understood one another if either had tried. The whole sequence hilighted Batman's tactical prowess and ability to control a situation. Maybe the most badass thing about the fight was that it ended exactly where Batman planned. That brings me to the big elephant in the room named \"Martha.\"I can't recall exactly which YouTuber put it this way, but if you thought the \"save Martha\" exchange was about their mothers having the same name, you had your brain turned off. The brain-on people have explained this to death, but it bears repeating. This was the moment when Superman became humanized to Batman. He was about to die, and his only concern was for his adoptive human mother. He still believed that the man about to take his life would do the right thing. Even with the cowl on, there was no mistaking the look on Batman's face. It was the look of shame, guilt, and sudden uncertainty that says \"What am I doing?\" Turns out even the most brutal, angry version of Bruce Wayne is better than Tony Stark at knowing right from wrong. At knowing that he had gone too far.From there, the third act was a series of truly impressive (albeit mostly CGI) fight sequences, beginning with what I regard as the undisputed champion of Batman fights. Nothing in the Nolan movies (and especially nothing in the Burton movies) even came close. Go ahead, try to convince yourself that Batman and Bane taking turns punching one another in the face until Bane's mask broke was a good fight sequence. No, this was a fight straight out of \"Arkham Knight,\" and it was glorious. The battle against Doomsday really was one for the books. From the moment Wonder Woman arrived accompanied by the intense sounds of Tina Guo's electric cello to Superman's tragic, heroic death at the hands of Doomsday, I was glued to the screen. Sure, the mere presence of Doomsday spoiled the end to a degree, but watching the Man of Steel laboring to carry that kryptonite spear towards certain death was no less impactful. A brief word on Jesse Eisenberg's take on Lex Luthor. At least one other reviewer on this site already said it best when they pointed out that this was his origin story. If you consider his scheme objectively, he is actually one of the more formidable incarnations of the character. If we're lucky, we'll eventually get to see a Snyder Cut of \"Justice League\" and find out where this story was actually meant to go. For the record, Joss Whedon and Danny Elfman both should have said \"no\" to taking a dump on someone else's art."
"BATMAN V SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE brings a fantastic surprise to a smash-hit team-up with one of the worlds most beloved DC Comics' icons of all time. The movie delivers spectacular casting, and fantastic acting with different characters having their shine in each scenes.The story follows Clark Kent/Superman who becomes a threat, after the destruction in Metropolis in Man Of Steel.(2013). Batman/Bruce Wayne sees him as a threat and begins his war on Superman.The movie brings spectacular storytelling, it tells the complications of human against alien who are on the same side, and the first meeting of Batman and Superman. The story of Bruce Wayne, with his many years of The Caped Crusader, sends him on a spiral of \"out of control\", sheer anger, and builds tension to wanting to defeat the Man of Steel. Snyder has fantastically gave this storytelling an exciting nod to the comics.Lex Luthor, played by Jesse Einsberg, delivers a very interesting performance, but very differently by him showing is his \"origin\" before he becomes a bald foe to the Man of Steel. He shows that his love of \"god vs man\" terrorises mankind when he ultimately creates Doomsday, and Batman realises Superman's inner heroism.It packs so many great \"out of nowhere\" excitement, including a first-look of the fearful Wonder Woman a.k.a. Diana Prince, played by Gal Gadot, and a fresh-new glimpse of the superhero DC canon: The Justice League.WATCH THIS MOVIE! The critics are out of their mind. It's a fun-packed action adventure which still keeps the movie enjoyable until it's final minutes of the movie. It's a FANTASTIC MOVIE! BEN AFFLECK AS BATMAN... is Incredible!A 10/10 overall!"
"I want to go on record as saying that this is a truly thrilling cinematic experience in so many ways. If pressed, I guess I could acknowledge that there were a couple ... let's say \"clumsy\" moments. And in a film that runs to three hours, that hardly seems like a significant issue, certainly not enough to rate it with fewer than 9 stars.This film has everything. There is dramatic tension right from the start. There is a magnificent story arc that picks up quite seamlessly from 'Man of Steel' and propels the viewer not only into the life of Clark Kent/Superman but also of Bruce Wayne/Batman.The villain is no mere cartoon of a villain; he is truly thoroughly (and apparently irrevocably) diabolical. He is a psychopath, and you wish for his death over and over and over. You want Superman to reduce him to ash with the power of his eyes.I have read a number of viewers' reviews, and it seems that the people who disliked the film / gave it a low rating had rather unfair and unrealistic expectations of it. That is, their own prejudices about how the plot could/should unfold or what the character development could/should be, etc. ruined the film for them. And that is a shame.My thought is: I settle into my seat, wait for the lights to dim, and then I wait to be transported by the film. I accept it, lock, stock, and barrel.As another reviewer remarked, I love how the film begins from the point of view of Bruce Wayne as he is among people on the ground who have fallen victim to the attack of Zod and the other Kryptonians.Why would Bruce Wayne not like Superman? Why would the good people of Earth hurl insults at Superman and burn him in effigy (on the news)? Because the good people of Earth just got catapulted into a new reality in which there are not only extraterrestrial beings (surprise!) but they are also superman! And a group of them are hell-bent on destroying humankind and taking the planet for themselves.It is difficult to see Superman as separate from the whole Kryptonian Krew.It seems that many moviegoers forgot that Bruce Wayne is also human. Sure, he's a hero, but he is flawed.. Just like the rest of us. He is a vigilante, after all.He has let his vigilantism get the better of him. HE is actually the one working outside the boundaries of the law, not Superman. It is the clear head of Alfred that shows us that he has gone into a rather dark place, that he has not seen what is really going on (in Luthor's scheme), and so he chooses to embark on his own scheme scheme to take out the alien invader. He is (allegedly) thinking of the future: if he wipes out the all-powerful alien, then it can't turn on humankind in the future. At least, he convinces himself of that.A philosophical question is raised in the film: should Clark Kent have remained a simple man from Kansas and never have become the Superman? Should he just let people die and let calamities happen? The question is answered for us in the character of Diana Prince/Wonder Woman. She withdrew from mankind (her exact words) and just sat around watching. Watching while people died horrible deaths all around her. So, should Superman have done the same? Do these special beings, these 'metahumans', have some kind of moral imperative to intervene, or should they be allowed to be regular people, too? It seems that humans want it both ways.It seems that humans are saying: \"Don't be a superalien ... except when I and my friends and family are in trouble. Then come save us.\""

"Batman v Superman: Ultimate Edition: If your looking for a quick, cheap thrill then you might not enjoy this film at the time. This movies theatrical version was butchered by WB and in doing so reshaped the story leaving numerous plot holes. So the Ultimate Edition is the full story and the one worth seeing. Watch 'Man of Steel' before seeing this movie. There is much to claw through here, so much so that the audience might easily find themselves exhausted from the overall aggression of the film. However, a lot of the story does work. The action is good, and the emotion feels real most of the time.This film is about Superman trying to become Superman. Trying to help the world, save people, find a place in this world not as an outcast, and yet is looked at has a threat by many. Superman is not from this world, yet He is trying to be human, find a place in this world, be excepted by earths people, and come into his destiny.This film is also about Batman being Batman for 20 years and losing faith in humanity, and fearing Superman, what Superman can do with his powers. Great film, great plot, great visuals. ---Yidioo"
"I didn't see the film in the theaters and just bought the \"Extended Edition \" on Amazon. I never properly saw Man of Steel- i think I rented it and watched it when already exhausted and fell asleep. I saw the mediocre user reviews and horrible reviews from critics of this film.They really have it wrong. This is the very best either Batman or Superman. It has a different take, on things. Much darker then earlier films even darker then the Christopher Nolan Batman films.First of all Christopher Nolan is an Executive Producer. So how bad could it be? I loved Sucker Punch and Zack Snyder was involved with that. So how bad could this be? Hans Zimmer did the music, so how bad could it be?I remember watching the old Superman TV shows and reading the Superman and Batman comics as a little kid and loved them, but i wouldn't call myself a \"fan boy\" of comic universes, like so many younger people today. As an older adult I will admit my favorite TV show of all time was Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but watched it on DVD only after it had finished. I saw the second of the Dark Knight series in the theater, but the other two, I watched on DVD. They were great, but not my favorite films like so many people. i also loved the first couple Superman and Batman films in the older series. Regardless, i was not waiting with baited breath to see Man of Steel or this one.I'm more of a serious film fan, who can watch Stanley Kubrick films over and over and my favorite films in the last twenty years, are Eyes Wide Shut and Intersteller, both of which i've watched multiple times.So, with that said, take it from me, the critics have this film very wrong, just as critics hated 2001: A Space Odyssey when it first came out. This film will have lasting appreciation.Surprised how much I liked Ben Afleck's Batman. it was hard to get into Henry Cavil's scrawnier looking Superman, but it grew on me. Amy Adams was great as Lois Lane, The Gal Gadol Wonder Women was amazing. Lex Luther was terrific, like Nolan's Joker. Jeremy Irons was the best Alfred ever. Holly Hunter and Diane Lane was good too. The movie had bad reviews but made a billion dollars. Hopefully everyone buys the Ultimate Edition and it breaks sales records and the film is re-appreciated. I have no idea what scenes this Ultimate Edition added, but it is pretty perfect. Now I can't wait for Wonder Woman and the Justice League and as soon as I finish writing this am going to watch Man of Steal. I'm into it now!I can only surmise that the bad reviews stem from too much expectations of the rigid fan boy types and the radical changes in tone, we see in this film.Total masterpiece of cinema, but I have a few criticisms. There are a few hollow scenes of typical Idiot cops and authorities getting everything wrong in a cliché type way and it has a few filler scenes of that type and a few moments here and there that felt rushed and cheesy. Maybe not everything restored into the Ultimate Edition should have been. I wish there had been more Kevin Costner scenes."

"The whole entire Batman V Superman movie was great and yes even though it felt slow to the majority of the people who watched it but to me I enjoyed every part and every scene of Batman V Superman and when it got to the fight scenes both batman VS Superman and the Doomsday fight it brought so much drama, intensity, and epic performances. So with that being said I give this movie a good 10/10 because it really did go to my expectations and it brought a powerful performance and a powerful yet epic introduction to the upcoming Justice League."

"When I first wrote a review for this movie a year ago exclaiming my excitement for the film, I had been high off a fresh dose of live-action DC superheroes playing out the beloved comic book stories that I had grown up on. It was all playing out before my eyes and coming to life. After a few months had passed, I began to notice things about the movie that I disliked: little gaps in the story, things that didn't add up, etc. My original rating of a 10 / 10 dropped to an 8 /10. But today it has gone back up to a 10. The extended version of the film not only rectifies the gaps but also silences critics.Many claimed that the movie was too dark or that it just didn't make sense. To those people, I say: \"Pick up a comic book!\" Many of the critics of this particular film were part of the superhero bandwagon that formed when Marvel began its spree of Avengers-related films. In fact, its estimated that over 60% of people who go to see 'superhero' genre films have never picked up a comic book in their life. I would argue that similar numbers could figure to those which view the CW televised DC Universe shows. People complain that DC comics is just too dark but the fact is that these movies are based upon actual comics which are meant to be dark (ex: The Dark Knight Returns, Injustice, etc.). Its like complaining that Game of Thrones (the TV series) sucks because they kill off too many characters. Read the books! Its frustrating to see such a beautiful work of art like Batman V Superman criticized by those ignorant to its universe and its meaning. This movie is in fact a catalyst that opens numerous doorways and leaves true fans in awe of the possibilities for future movies. But regardless of whether or not people choose to educate themselves, this film's DVD/Blu-ray extended version puts the theater release to shame. All of the plot holes and gaps are filled in 30 minutes of extended footage scattered throughout the film. The movie ultimately becomes more complete and people will wish that the movie had shown the full 3 hours of footage in its theatrical debut. As a major DC comics fan, I will of course pick up on things that a comics fan would not, but someone who does not read comics would learn to appreciate this film in its entirety with the extended version. Get your hands on a copy today or find it on Netflix or the internet somewhere!"

"I ignored the bad reviews and watched anyways. This film had a lot to live up to after Civil War was released and I went into this film expecting the worst. It ended up to be the best Superhero film of 2016 to me. One complaint was that this film was more concerned about universe building than telling a great story than Civil War but for me it was the other way around; Civil War felt like a build up to something else and to be honest, I felt that way when I saw the other MCU films. Batman vs Superman however not only had a great story, but it also felt a lot more consistent than Civil War. This film was way more diverse with the cast than the MCU but unlike the MCU, I felt like this film doesn't go overboard with the SJW stuff like the MCU films or The Star Wars Sequel films do. The Visuals were AMAZING, The Score by Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL was AMAZING as well, The Tone is just right as I actually felt for the characters emotionally, The Cinematography kept my eyes glued to the screen, and the script felt really Intelligent and Complex and despite people calling the writing confusing, I was able to piece it together with no problem whatsoever. This film is similar to Empire Strikes back in terms of popularity so over time after the other movies are released, this movie would probably be more popular.This film was way better than I Expected and deserves another chance.

"Its shame to see what critics and marvel fans did to this movie and targeted Zack Snyder for it. I have seen this movie more than 25 times till date. And i enjoy this movie as much as i enjoyed the first time. The fans who have read DC comics, wouldn't be disappointed in this movie. Its dark movie, yes it is. Because the title shows the intense situation at hand. Two superheroes about to rip each other apart for whatever reasons that brought them to this stage. Yes it had to be dark and intense.Only marvel can be stupid enough to show an alien invasion where humans are loosing the battle and the super heroes are cracking jokes while battles as if they are playing ping pong. a person playing Call of Duty game is more serious while playing than the marvel heroes fighting aliens."

"Last week some news came out from somebody online who had claimed to have seen a finished version of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. If you were like me, you've been leery of checking it out because you weren't sure how much might actually be true. Now Zack Snyder has spoken out about the spoiler-filled post, although his response doesn't really clear anything up.In a word, to MTV, he called the post \"hilarious,which might imply that he's saying that it's mostly, if not entirely, untrue. That might be the case, but then again he could have just said it was untrue and he didn't say that. What he did say, however, is that he doesn't like spoilers. While this may seem odd for the director who's most recent trailer appeared to give away the entire movie, Snyder says that's not the case. Even if you've seen the trailer, you can rest easy, as there is much more we have not seen in then finished film. Says Snyder I have the benefit of seeing the movie. It's cool that think it's too much, and I appreciate people not wanting to know, but there's plenty that they don't know. There's a lot of movie that's not in the trailer. In the process of calling the Batman v Superman Reddit review hilarious, Snyder goes on to talk about how he hates it when spoilers come out. The director would much rather that fans see the movie mostly blind. While he understands that some fans may wish to find the answers before hand, he wants his movies to be mysteries going in. If you're, as an audience member, exploring these articles, looking for answers to questions that you have, maybe you're okay with knowing before you go. It's like an individual taste. But like I said, I want people to see the movie without knowing.Spoilers are a topic that mean different things to different people. While most try to avoid them to some degree, the need to solve the mystery is a nearly universal human experience. We have an inclination to want to know the truth, even while also wanting to be surprised. For most of us getting some information is good, but getting all the information is bad, of course, only getting the details that you want can be difficult."
"The theatrical is choppy, poorly edited, hard to follow, with some really good moments mixed in their. The extended is much more fluent and is much easier to follow, it does have a long runtime, which might make it seem a bit dragging on, but if you like long films done right, like Lord of the Rings, you will like this movie as long as you get into the characters and story. Speaking of which, the story starts out perfectly showing Bruce Wayne as a character, and it is very powerful. There are several moments in this movie that are powerful, emotional, and shocking. Characters. Batman is my favorite fictional character of all time, and believe me when I say, Ben Affleck as Batman was perfect, he had the charisma, the anger, and the look of being through some bad stuff Gal Gadot also does perfect as Wonder Woman, but if you want to really see how good she does, go watch the Wonder Woman movie. Henry Call as Superman. I really don't like it when people say Christopher Reeves is better. Don't get me wrong, Reeves does great, but can you imagine him as Superman in this movie? I wouldn't like it. It would be like Adam West playing Batman in The Dark Knight. Henry Cavill does great in this role, I can say everything about him as I said with Ben Affleck. Jesse Eisenberg as Luthor. I thought it was different in a good way. I've heard a criticism for him as being too much like Joker, but is that a bad thing? Joker is my favorite villain, so to see Superman have an enemy that crazy, but still hold the values Luthor needs to be Luthor, I think it is great. The thing I thought this movie was lacking in the first and second acts was humor, at least good humor. If there was more humor, I would've given this movie a ten because it would give a more relaxing feel to the parts that needed it. All in all though, this movie was awesome, it had powerful moments, it was badass, and just plain fun. It had a great story arc and does its job very well."

"*I will be talking about the Ultimate Edition of the film* This was one of the most anticipated CBM of all time. Ever since the arrival and subsequent success of Marvel's The Avengers people have wondered when will DC launch its own cinematic universe, one of the main reasons being the opportunity to finally see titans such as Batman and Superman share the screen together: the ultimate nerd dream. On 2016, the moment finally came for BvS to be released AND.. it performed poorly. Not only did critical reception left a lot to be desired, but fan reactions where surprisingly split after its cinematic debut. People either loved it and called Zack a genius, or hated it and called him a hack. Me, personally, I found myself with middle of the road feelings, for sure, but more leaning towards the negative side with subsequent viewings. The theatrical cut of the film showcased amazing performances, incredible visuals, and action set pieces that seemed like comic book panels come to life, in a good way. However, when it comes to its narrative structure and more technical aspects like editing, the film was seriously flawed. More plot holes than Age of Ultron, questionable character decisions, random editing that lacked cohesion and focus, and forced dramatic moments that lacked any impact because the attempts at character development ranged from limited to nonexistent, especially when it comes to Superman's character. I thought it was a 5/10 movie at best. As such, I was kind of skeptical about the idea of a 30 minute longer version. I say kind of because I know how Zack works. I remember Watchmen being vastly improved with its director's cut, so in a way I was expecting BvS to perform in a similar manner, but I also feared those 30 minutes wold be just there to amplify action and discredit storytelling issues. Oh boy, I'm so glad I was proved wrong. The ultimate cut of the film was infuriating, but not because it was awful, but because it questions the sanity of WB executives and editors and makes you wonder what were they thinking during the editing process. What I got out of the Ultimate Edition was a thought-provoking deconstruction of two very iconic superheroes that gave spotlight to the struggles both of them face when they aren't fighting crime. What I got was an extremely well produced character study on both Batman and Superman in a cynical world, a world dangerously close to our own. We meet Batman as a ruthless, worn out hero that has seen the failure behind his ideals and witnessed some truly horrifying things in his life. Superman, on the other hand, is portrayed as a godlike figure that seeks to do good in the world, but finds himself emotionally conflicted once he realized that every good deed he does leaves behind a trail of destruction (most of it due to Luthor's antics). In my opinion, this is a hugely original approach, one that distances itself from the rest of the competition and delivers a dark, somber, yet relevant superhero movie that understands both characters and gives them real human struggles to deal with. I felt invested in both of them, and hoped that by the end of the film both could find a way to redeem themselves. Their character arcs were very well established during the first two acts of the movie, and by the time we get to the titular climactic battle the emotion behind the jaw-dropping action is intensified. Lex Luthor as a villain was also given more time to develop with this new edition. One of the main criticisms with the original version was the fact that his plan relied too much on conveniences, and the character's mannerisms and mad-scientist attitude was annoying, and that goes without saying his motivations were unclear. Not only do we spend more time understanding his hate for any godlike figure and thus his hatred for Superman, but the added scenes allowed us to witness his entire plan come to fruition. It sells the cold, manipulative, calculating attributes of his comic counterpart. The acting is spot on. Every actor owns his/her role, from Cavill's Superman, to Ben Affleck as Batman, Eisenberg as Luthor, and Gadot as Wonder Woman, whose scenes are brief, but are more than enough to sell the strong and ferocious warrior that she is. Cinematography is stunning, and miles above that of Man of Steel's. And the soundtrack by Zimmer and Junkie XL? Perfect, just perfect. When it comes to flaws, the film still has some of those. The Martha moment, while serving as a pivotal character moment for Batman, felt off in execution, and its understandable that many people got mad at it. If your main complaint about BvS the first time around was its bleak tone and subject matter, this film is still not for you. I understand most were expecting to see the heroes being the most iconic versions of themselves, clashing in an elongated battle and evoking the same feelings The Avengers gave audiences back in 2012. In that sense, the film will remain divisive, but at least I have the comfort of saying that, at the very least, the film is competently made."

"This film was amazing. Ben Affleck was easily the best part of this movie, he brought his a-game as Batman. The chemistry between Affleck & Irons was outstanding. Gal Gadot did a great job as Wonder Woman. The fight between Batman & Superman was awesome. The final fight with Doomsday was outstanding in every way possible. However, there is only one problem with this film and that's Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor. He was sadly missed cast in this role, but then again it's really the fault of Warner Bros. Studios. Overall, this film deliver on almost every level. I highly recommend that you watch the extended version of this film."

"I know I know. I saw it in theaters too, and felt like it could've been so much better. While the Batman element was good, the narrative felt fractured, and the third act was just one long stunt scene. Superman was relegated to a supporting character, and other characters didn't get a chance to shine. And then I chanced on the ultimate cut. Calling it 30 mins of \"extra\" footage is unfair to Zack Snyder because it's exactly these 30 mins that makes the movie a worthy one. What I can say about the theatrical cut is this - It had the blockbuster elements - music, visuals, stunts, CGI. But, it lacked the human elements. The first 20 mins of the movie had it, but not after that. The extended cut in comparison has a flow to the narrative. There are no disjointed scenes, everything flows smoothly, and there's connective tissue. Superman gets to spend some time with his father, and mother. Clark Kent does some investigative journalism. Superman helps the people after the blast. Lois Lane doesn't jump to conclusions, she gets to the bottom of the crime. Lex Luthor apparently had a coherent plan - everything is explained pretty well. Wonder Woman was already good, so there's no change there :) Also, the \"Martha\" scene seems better executed, because it is a few seconds longer, and there's time to breathe it in. So, here's my take on this movie - The theatrical cut was junk. Get the Bluray for ultimate edition, and you shall not be disappointed. I've seen it so many more times now, and it's the definitive cut. It is the movie we deserve. It's a unique take on Batman, and Superman. It's a gritty take on the superhero movie genre, and definitely the best DCEU movie, and the best DC movie since The Dark Knight.P.S. Yes it's dark. We're adults, and we should appreciate mature film making without intentionally silly moments. It attempts to be philosophical, and something deep instead of just trying to make you chuckle."

"This is one of the best superhero movies ever made. Zack Snyder is a magician behind the camera.The reason behind so many complaints is the fact that Warner Bros. marketed this movie as a fight between Batman and Superman. That's not what it is. It's a movie about the origins of the Justice League.The cinematography, the acting and the score are all second to none. This film is phenomenal.P.S: watch the 3 hour extended cut that Snyder intended you to see, not the 2 and a half hour movie that Warner Bros. decided would be better for theaters."

"I don't care what the critics say, this is a very well-done movie. I'll start my review by listing what I like about the movie.1.) Ben Affleck is the best batman to me and it is not close. He pulls off the role of an aging batman extremely well. Also, Zack Snyder's vision of batman is legit. I have always hated batman up until this adaptation of him. Instead of being a conflicted and idealistic batman, this batman is dark, gritty, and 100% a badass. His equipment is decked out with machine guns and he has no aversion to killing people. In fact, he probably kills about 50 criminal by the time this movie is over. The warehouse scene is the coolest batman scene in any movie.2.) The development of a grudge between batman and superman is pulled off flawlessly. It actually makes sense why batman dislikes superman. Then, when they do fight it is about the coolest thing you can expect to see from a superhero film. 3.) I disagree with a lot of people about Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor. In my opinion, he played his role to perfection. 4.) B v S sets up Wonder Woman and Justice League with Gal Gadot's cameo as Wonder Woman and short clips of Aquaman, the Flash, and Cyborg. B v S is one of my favorite superhero films and rewatching it never gets old."

"The theatrical cut of this film is garbage which is why I rated it eight stars instead of nine. The first time I watched this film I didn't like it (not straight out hate but didn't like). Character motivations didn't make any sense, Lex was annoying as s***, editing was sloppy, and it was overly dark and broody for an action superhero movie. A year + a half, five Marvel films, a ton of bad reviews and a Justice League later a thought popped into my head: \"what if I watched BVS again\". This time I didn't have trailers ruining the best moments, I only vaguely remembered the film, and I was conditioned to look at it negatively but something unexpected happened: I actually loved it. Superman was just a normal person that tried to make a difference cause he could that others imposed their own beliefs on. Lex Luthor was a genius that couldn't stand his powerlessness compared to Superman or more accurately a super being. As Alfred said \"The fever, the rage, the feeling of powerlessness that turns good men... cruel\" and you see the same thought process in Batman. Batman, just like Lex Luthor feels powerless in the midst of a god-being and just like Lex he attempts to destroy him so he can get his sense of power back but unlike Lex, Batman learns something. I what is one of the corniest lines of the movie Superman says, \"Martha\" when he knows he can't win against Batman in a late desperate attempt to save his mother. Not only does this name connect with Bruce Wayne but it also shows what really matters to a man of steel: it isn't power, it isn't fame or anything else, it is his Mother and on a broader scale it is people. Lex (who doesn't care about people at all) knows he doesn't have the power so he creates something from his blood and the remains of Zod: A Doomsday for Superman. Not only does this film have depth but it also doesn't always explain it to you which is rare in a blockbuster action superhero flick normally cater to semi-comic book fans and people that want to shove popcorn in their mouths. This film rewards you for really noticing the details while still having massive explosions. One of my favorites is how Lex has all of Batman's branded killed which is why he isn't afraid of the branding at the end or Grandma's Peach Tea as a way of scaring the s*** out of someone. Of course, this film isn't perfect and I do have personal dislikes. The Batman V Superman fight was slow and pretty boring especially after watching such an amazing fight in Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 2 (If you haven't watched the animated Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 1 and 2 you are sorely missing out on something fantastic). Also, the addition of Wonder Woman who pretty much steals a hacker thing, gives it back and then suits up and fights against a giant monster thing. Not to say I don't like Wonder Woman (She is one of my favorite Superheroes of all time who showed not only can woman kick a** but they also don't need to be ashamed of their sexuality or gender) but she wasn't really that helpful to the plot and just brought in to expand the universe which was well done through Lex's superhuman hunting files. Also, the post-apocalyptic scene that was just a dream could have been cut but nothing is perfect except movies like Citizen Kane which isn't a lot of fun to watch cause it is too perfect. So to summarize, the theatrical cut is bad, the ultimate cut is Amazing and the other cut is meh. Please give it a second chance because it deserves it and save a good director from losing grace because of something he didn't do."
"I really liked it, don't know what all the hate is about. I'm actually a Marvel fan from when I was 7 or so, but Superman and Batman together in 1 movie? Just great. And personally I like Ben Affleck even better than Christian Bale as Batman. So just watch and enjoy, I know I did!"

"That's right. We have been waiting for these two heroes to finally meet and fight against each other. This movie is so good in both plot and special effects.Henry Cavill and Ben Affleck have performed well in their acting stages. They are the best superhero actors and they have filmed their fighting scenes very well. The movie starts to show the conflict between the lives of the heroes and now they have blamed each other for it. This movie is amazing and sets up a good plot for Dawn Justice."

"Actually...I didn't know what to expect. When you see Wonder Woman, you know it will be off of Wonder Woman and off of a Wonder Woman story, but with Batman V Superman, I was like, \"hmmmm, so who is this about?\" It was pretty obvious that it would feature many characters, but I thought the introduction to Batman was amazing. Ben Affleck nailed the part, not only as Batman but also as Bruce Wayne. He is my Batman. Henry Cavill continued to be super as the Man of Steel. And he is my Super - Man. A dark story? Yes, without a doubt. Could it have had a few more jokes? Sure. But not all movies or stories need to have jokes when certain events are serious. I really hope people can see this review and take another look at the movie, because, I loved it. I really hope the ratings can go up, eventually. And P.S, this movie is the perfect set up to Justice League."

"I'll start by making it clear I have only ever seen the Ultimate Edition. I'm aware of what was cut out for the theatrical release, so I will concede up front that most of the criticisms about pacing, editing, and missing bits of plot at release were merited.With that caveat out of the way, I must reiterate that this was bar-none the boldest superhero movie I have ever seen. To me, it was arguably the best as well, though \"best\" shouldn't be taken to mean \"most enjoyable.\" That honor easily goes to \"Thor: Ragnarok.\" What makes BvS stand out among other films in the genre is that it takes two characters who have been done to death since the 1970s and brings them up to date. I recently tried to watch \"Superman: The Movie\" for the first time in a number of years, and while it was still good and Reeves will always be iconic, I just couldn't take it seriously. I'll put it this way: If the story in BvS was \"stupid\" in your view but Superman turning back time by spinning the earth backward on its axis didn't seem like one of the dumbest things you have ever seen -in any movie from any genre- to the extent that it outright ruins the movie for you, then your opinion about BvS isn't worth much. Nostalgic bias was always going to be a problem for this movie, and the way people reacted to and reviewed \"Man of Steel\" was telling in this regard.That brings me to Zack Snyder's take on Superman. You know, that guy whose status as the first extraterrestrial ever encountered by humanity was a total non-issue in the old movies. Apparently, Snyder has a similar view to my own in that his take on the Man of Steel makes his being an alien a core piece of his identity. He may look like any other (absurdly attractive) person, but he knows what he is, and that makes him perpetually uncertain of where he fits in this world. He is essentially good and really does care about people, but he struggles to truly empathize with the likes of us. To be human is to be frail, and that is not something he can easily relate to. This is the root of his conflict with Batman.Just as Clark struggles to genuinely relate to most people, Snyder's Batman either refuses to or otherwise just can't relate to Superman. He doesn't see him as anything but a threat regardless of Superman's clear good intentions. Remember, a small group of Kryptonians were able to bring humanity to the brink of extinction in less than a day, and Bruce Wayne is nothing if not a realist. He didn't know the guy from Kansas. He only knew the god from another world.While Batman's anger toward and fear of Superman are readily apparent from the start, Superman's inability to imagine things from Bruce Wayne's perspective only becomes truly apparent during their first real interaction. This reminded me of the animated version of the \"world's finest\" storyline, where Superman judges Batman harshly for using fear tactics and threats of violence (also, actual violence) to get the job done. Superman wasn't willing to consider what it would take for a human man to fight criminals and save innocents, or what that life would do to him over time. Just as Batman didn't see the guy from Kansas, Superman didn't see the man who lives his life trapped in one brutal, unthinkably traumatic moment (this was beautifully conveyed during the film's opening moments), and had spent his whole adult life bearing witness to humanity at its absolute worst.The conflict between these two characters is as old as human history. They want the same things, but they can't understand one another. So they fight. And what a fight it was.Watching a fight between, say, Captain America and Iron Man was, to me, more frustrating than anything because each understood the other's perspective perfectly. The fight between Batman and Superman in BvS was genuinely gut-wrenching, as intended, because they would have understood one another if either had tried. The whole sequence hilighted Batman's tactical prowess and ability to control a situation. Maybe the most badass thing about the fight was that it ended exactly where Batman planned. That brings me to the big elephant in the room named \"Martha.\"I can't recall exactly which YouTuber put it this way, but if you thought the \"save Martha\" exchange was about their mothers having the same name, you had your brain turned off. The brain-on people have explained this to death, but it bears repeating. This was the moment when Superman became humanized to Batman. He was about to die, and his only concern was for his adoptive human mother. He still believed that the man about to take his life would do the right thing. Even with the cowl on, there was no mistaking the look on Batman's face. It was the look of shame, guilt, and sudden uncertainty that says \"What am I doing?\" Turns out even the most brutal, angry version of Bruce Wayne is better than Tony Stark at knowing right from wrong. At knowing that he had gone too far.From there, the third act was a series of truly impressive (albeit mostly CGI) fight sequences, beginning with what I regard as the undisputed champion of Batman fights. Nothing in the Nolan movies (and especially nothing in the Burton movies) even came close. Go ahead, try to convince yourself that Batman and Bane taking turns punching one another in the face until Bane's mask broke was a good fight sequence. No, this was a fight straight out of \"Arkham Knight,\" and it was glorious. The battle against Doomsday really was one for the books. From the moment Wonder Woman arrived accompanied by the intense sounds of Tina Guo's electric cello to Superman's tragic, heroic death at the hands of Doomsday, I was glued to the screen. Sure, the mere presence of Doomsday spoiled the end to a degree, but watching the Man of Steel laboring to carry that kryptonite spear towards certain death was no less impactful. A brief word on Jesse Eisenberg's take on Lex Luthor. At least one other reviewer on this site already said it best when they pointed out that this was his origin story. If you consider his scheme objectively, he is actually one of the more formidable incarnations of the character. If we're lucky, we'll eventually get to see a Snyder Cut of \"Justice League\" and find out where this story was actually meant to go. For the record, Joss Whedon and Danny Elfman both should have said \"no\" to taking a dump on someone else's art."
"BATMAN V SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE brings a fantastic surprise to a smash-hit team-up with one of the worlds most beloved DC Comics' icons of all time. The movie delivers spectacular casting, and fantastic acting with different characters having their shine in each scenes.The story follows Clark Kent/Superman who becomes a threat, after the destruction in Metropolis in Man Of Steel.(2013). Batman/Bruce Wayne sees him as a threat and begins his war on Superman.The movie brings spectacular storytelling, it tells the complications of human against alien who are on the same side, and the first meeting of Batman and Superman. The story of Bruce Wayne, with his many years of The Caped Crusader, sends him on a spiral of \"out of control\", sheer anger, and builds tension to wanting to defeat the Man of Steel. Snyder has fantastically gave this storytelling an exciting nod to the comics.Lex Luthor, played by Jesse Einsberg, delivers a very interesting performance, but very differently by him showing is his \"origin\" before he becomes a bald foe to the Man of Steel. He shows that his love of \"god vs man\" terrorises mankind when he ultimately creates Doomsday, and Batman realises Superman's inner heroism.It packs so many great \"out of nowhere\" excitement, including a first-look of the fearful Wonder Woman a.k.a. Diana Prince, played by Gal Gadot, and a fresh-new glimpse of the superhero DC canon: The Justice League.WATCH THIS MOVIE! The critics are out of their mind. It's a fun-packed action adventure which still keeps the movie enjoyable until it's final minutes of the movie. It's a FANTASTIC MOVIE! BEN AFFLECK AS BATMAN... is Incredible!A 10/10 overall!"
"I want to go on record as saying that this is a truly thrilling cinematic experience in so many ways. If pressed, I guess I could acknowledge that there were a couple ... let's say \"clumsy\" moments. And in a film that runs to three hours, that hardly seems like a significant issue, certainly not enough to rate it with fewer than 9 stars.This film has everything. There is dramatic tension right from the start. There is a magnificent story arc that picks up quite seamlessly from 'Man of Steel' and propels the viewer not only into the life of Clark Kent/Superman but also of Bruce Wayne/Batman.The villain is no mere cartoon of a villain; he is truly thoroughly (and apparently irrevocably) diabolical. He is a psychopath, and you wish for his death over and over and over. You want Superman to reduce him to ash with the power of his eyes.I have read a number of viewers' reviews, and it seems that the people who disliked the film / gave it a low rating had rather unfair and unrealistic expectations of it. That is, their own prejudices about how the plot could/should unfold or what the character development could/should be, etc. ruined the film for them. And that is a shame.My thought is: I settle into my seat, wait for the lights to dim, and then I wait to be transported by the film. I accept it, lock, stock, and barrel.As another reviewer remarked, I love how the film begins from the point of view of Bruce Wayne as he is among people on the ground who have fallen victim to the attack of Zod and the other Kryptonians.Why would Bruce Wayne not like Superman? Why would the good people of Earth hurl insults at Superman and burn him in effigy (on the news)? Because the good people of Earth just got catapulted into a new reality in which there are not only extraterrestrial beings (surprise!) but they are also superman! And a group of them are hell-bent on destroying humankind and taking the planet for themselves.It is difficult to see Superman as separate from the whole Kryptonian Krew.It seems that many moviegoers forgot that Bruce Wayne is also human. Sure, he's a hero, but he is flawed.. Just like the rest of us. He is a vigilante, after all.He has let his vigilantism get the better of him. HE is actually the one working outside the boundaries of the law, not Superman. It is the clear head of Alfred that shows us that he has gone into a rather dark place, that he has not seen what is really going on (in Luthor's scheme), and so he chooses to embark on his own scheme scheme to take out the alien invader. He is (allegedly) thinking of the future: if he wipes out the all-powerful alien, then it can't turn on humankind in the future. At least, he convinces himself of that.A philosophical question is raised in the film: should Clark Kent have remained a simple man from Kansas and never have become the Superman? Should he just let people die and let calamities happen? The question is answered for us in the character of Diana Prince/Wonder Woman. She withdrew from mankind (her exact words) and just sat around watching. Watching while people died horrible deaths all around her. So, should Superman have done the same? Do these special beings, these 'metahumans', have some kind of moral imperative to intervene, or should they be allowed to be regular people, too? It seems that humans want it both ways.It seems that humans are saying: \"Don't be a superalien ... except when I and my friends and family are in trouble. Then come save us.\""

"Batman v Superman: Ultimate Edition: If your looking for a quick, cheap thrill then you might not enjoy this film at the time. This movies theatrical version was butchered by WB and in doing so reshaped the story leaving numerous plot holes. So the Ultimate Edition is the full story and the one worth seeing. Watch 'Man of Steel' before seeing this movie. There is much to claw through here, so much so that the audience might easily find themselves exhausted from the overall aggression of the film. However, a lot of the story does work. The action is good, and the emotion feels real most of the time.This film is about Superman trying to become Superman. Trying to help the world, save people, find a place in this world not as an outcast, and yet is looked at has a threat by many. Superman is not from this world, yet He is trying to be human, find a place in this world, be excepted by earths people, and come into his destiny.This film is also about Batman being Batman for 20 years and losing faith in humanity, and fearing Superman, what Superman can do with his powers. Great film, great plot, great visuals. ---Yidioo"
"I didn't see the film in the theaters and just bought the \"Extended Edition \" on Amazon. I never properly saw Man of Steel- i think I rented it and watched it when already exhausted and fell asleep. I saw the mediocre user reviews and horrible reviews from critics of this film.They really have it wrong. This is the very best either Batman or Superman. It has a different take, on things. Much darker then earlier films even darker then the Christopher Nolan Batman films.First of all Christopher Nolan is an Executive Producer. So how bad could it be? I loved Sucker Punch and Zack Snyder was involved with that. So how bad could this be? Hans Zimmer did the music, so how bad could it be?I remember watching the old Superman TV shows and reading the Superman and Batman comics as a little kid and loved them, but i wouldn't call myself a \"fan boy\" of comic universes, like so many younger people today. As an older adult I will admit my favorite TV show of all time was Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but watched it on DVD only after it had finished. I saw the second of the Dark Knight series in the theater, but the other two, I watched on DVD. They were great, but not my favorite films like so many people. i also loved the first couple Superman and Batman films in the older series. Regardless, i was not waiting with baited breath to see Man of Steel or this one.I'm more of a serious film fan, who can watch Stanley Kubrick films over and over and my favorite films in the last twenty years, are Eyes Wide Shut and Intersteller, both of which i've watched multiple times.So, with that said, take it from me, the critics have this film very wrong, just as critics hated 2001: A Space Odyssey when it first came out. This film will have lasting appreciation.Surprised how much I liked Ben Afleck's Batman. it was hard to get into Henry Cavil's scrawnier looking Superman, but it grew on me. Amy Adams was great as Lois Lane, The Gal Gadol Wonder Women was amazing. Lex Luther was terrific, like Nolan's Joker. Jeremy Irons was the best Alfred ever. Holly Hunter and Diane Lane was good too. The movie had bad reviews but made a billion dollars. Hopefully everyone buys the Ultimate Edition and it breaks sales records and the film is re-appreciated. I have no idea what scenes this Ultimate Edition added, but it is pretty perfect. Now I can't wait for Wonder Woman and the Justice League and as soon as I finish writing this am going to watch Man of Steal. I'm into it now!I can only surmise that the bad reviews stem from too much expectations of the rigid fan boy types and the radical changes in tone, we see in this film.Total masterpiece of cinema, but I have a few criticisms. There are a few hollow scenes of typical Idiot cops and authorities getting everything wrong in a cliché type way and it has a few filler scenes of that type and a few moments here and there that felt rushed and cheesy. Maybe not everything restored into the Ultimate Edition should have been. I wish there had been more Kevin Costner scenes."

"The whole entire Batman V Superman movie was great and yes even though it felt slow to the majority of the people who watched it but to me I enjoyed every part and every scene of Batman V Superman and when it got to the fight scenes both batman VS Superman and the Doomsday fight it brought so much drama, intensity, and epic performances. So with that being said I give this movie a good 10/10 because it really did go to my expectations and it brought a powerful performance and a powerful yet epic introduction to the upcoming Justice League."

"When I first wrote a review for this movie a year ago exclaiming my excitement for the film, I had been high off a fresh dose of live-action DC superheroes playing out the beloved comic book stories that I had grown up on. It was all playing out before my eyes and coming to life. After a few months had passed, I began to notice things about the movie that I disliked: little gaps in the story, things that didn't add up, etc. My original rating of a 10 / 10 dropped to an 8 /10. But today it has gone back up to a 10. The extended version of the film not only rectifies the gaps but also silences critics.Many claimed that the movie was too dark or that it just didn't make sense. To those people, I say: \"Pick up a comic book!\" Many of the critics of this particular film were part of the superhero bandwagon that formed when Marvel began its spree of Avengers-related films. In fact, its estimated that over 60% of people who go to see 'superhero' genre films have never picked up a comic book in their life. I would argue that similar numbers could figure to those which view the CW televised DC Universe shows. People complain that DC comics is just too dark but the fact is that these movies are based upon actual comics which are meant to be dark (ex: The Dark Knight Returns, Injustice, etc.). Its like complaining that Game of Thrones (the TV series) sucks because they kill off too many characters. Read the books! Its frustrating to see such a beautiful work of art like Batman V Superman criticized by those ignorant to its universe and its meaning. This movie is in fact a catalyst that opens numerous doorways and leaves true fans in awe of the possibilities for future movies. But regardless of whether or not people choose to educate themselves, this film's DVD/Blu-ray extended version puts the theater release to shame. All of the plot holes and gaps are filled in 30 minutes of extended footage scattered throughout the film. The movie ultimately becomes more complete and people will wish that the movie had shown the full 3 hours of footage in its theatrical debut. As a major DC comics fan, I will of course pick up on things that a comics fan would not, but someone who does not read comics would learn to appreciate this film in its entirety with the extended version. Get your hands on a copy today or find it on Netflix or the internet somewhere!"

"I ignored the bad reviews and watched anyways. This film had a lot to live up to after Civil War was released and I went into this film expecting the worst. It ended up to be the best Superhero film of 2016 to me. One complaint was that this film was more concerned about universe building than telling a great story than Civil War but for me it was the other way around; Civil War felt like a build up to something else and to be honest, I felt that way when I saw the other MCU films. Batman vs Superman however not only had a great story, but it also felt a lot more consistent than Civil War. This film was way more diverse with the cast than the MCU but unlike the MCU, I felt like this film doesn't go overboard with the SJW stuff like the MCU films or The Star Wars Sequel films do. The Visuals were AMAZING, The Score by Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL was AMAZING as well, The Tone is just right as I actually felt for the characters emotionally, The Cinematography kept my eyes glued to the screen, and the script felt really Intelligent and Complex and despite people calling the writing confusing, I was able to piece it together with no problem whatsoever. This film is similar to Empire Strikes back in terms of popularity so over time after the other movies are released, this movie would probably be more popular.This film was way better than I Expected and deserves another chance.

"Its shame to see what critics and marvel fans did to this movie and targeted Zack Snyder for it. I have seen this movie more than 25 times till date. And i enjoy this movie as much as i enjoyed the first time. The fans who have read DC comics, wouldn't be disappointed in this movie. Its dark movie, yes it is. Because the title shows the intense situation at hand. Two superheroes about to rip each other apart for whatever reasons that brought them to this stage. Yes it had to be dark and intense.Only marvel can be stupid enough to show an alien invasion where humans are loosing the battle and the super heroes are cracking jokes while battles as if they are playing ping pong. a person playing Call of Duty game is more serious while playing than the marvel heroes fighting aliens."

"Last week some news came out from somebody online who had claimed to have seen a finished version of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. If you were like me, you've been leery of checking it out because you weren't sure how much might actually be true. Now Zack Snyder has spoken out about the spoiler-filled post, although his response doesn't really clear anything up.In a word, to MTV, he called the post \"hilarious,which might imply that he's saying that it's mostly, if not entirely, untrue. That might be the case, but then again he could have just said it was untrue and he didn't say that. What he did say, however, is that he doesn't like spoilers. While this may seem odd for the director who's most recent trailer appeared to give away the entire movie, Snyder says that's not the case. Even if you've seen the trailer, you can rest easy, as there is much more we have not seen in then finished film. Says Snyder I have the benefit of seeing the movie. It's cool that think it's too much, and I appreciate people not wanting to know, but there's plenty that they don't know. There's a lot of movie that's not in the trailer. In the process of calling the Batman v Superman Reddit review hilarious, Snyder goes on to talk about how he hates it when spoilers come out. The director would much rather that fans see the movie mostly blind. While he understands that some fans may wish to find the answers before hand, he wants his movies to be mysteries going in. If you're, as an audience member, exploring these articles, looking for answers to questions that you have, maybe you're okay with knowing before you go. It's like an individual taste. But like I said, I want people to see the movie without knowing.Spoilers are a topic that mean different things to different people. While most try to avoid them to some degree, the need to solve the mystery is a nearly universal human experience. We have an inclination to want to know the truth, even while also wanting to be surprised. For most of us getting some information is good, but getting all the information is bad, of course, only getting the details that you want can be difficult."
"The theatrical is choppy, poorly edited, hard to follow, with some really good moments mixed in their. The extended is much more fluent and is much easier to follow, it does have a long runtime, which might make it seem a bit dragging on, but if you like long films done right, like Lord of the Rings, you will like this movie as long as you get into the characters and story. Speaking of which, the story starts out perfectly showing Bruce Wayne as a character, and it is very powerful. There are several moments in this movie that are powerful, emotional, and shocking. Characters. Batman is my favorite fictional character of all time, and believe me when I say, Ben Affleck as Batman was perfect, he had the charisma, the anger, and the look of being through some bad stuff Gal Gadot also does perfect as Wonder Woman, but if you want to really see how good she does, go watch the Wonder Woman movie. Henry Call as Superman. I really don't like it when people say Christopher Reeves is better. Don't get me wrong, Reeves does great, but can you imagine him as Superman in this movie? I wouldn't like it. It would be like Adam West playing Batman in The Dark Knight. Henry Cavill does great in this role, I can say everything about him as I said with Ben Affleck. Jesse Eisenberg as Luthor. I thought it was different in a good way. I've heard a criticism for him as being too much like Joker, but is that a bad thing? Joker is my favorite villain, so to see Superman have an enemy that crazy, but still hold the values Luthor needs to be Luthor, I think it is great. The thing I thought this movie was lacking in the first and second acts was humor, at least good humor. If there was more humor, I would've given this movie a ten because it would give a more relaxing feel to the parts that needed it. All in all though, this movie was awesome, it had powerful moments, it was badass, and just plain fun. It had a great story arc and does its job very well."

"*I will be talking about the Ultimate Edition of the film* This was one of the most anticipated CBM of all time. Ever since the arrival and subsequent success of Marvel's The Avengers people have wondered when will DC launch its own cinematic universe, one of the main reasons being the opportunity to finally see titans such as Batman and Superman share the screen together: the ultimate nerd dream. On 2016, the moment finally came for BvS to be released AND.. it performed poorly. Not only did critical reception left a lot to be desired, but fan reactions where surprisingly split after its cinematic debut. People either loved it and called Zack a genius, or hated it and called him a hack. Me, personally, I found myself with middle of the road feelings, for sure, but more leaning towards the negative side with subsequent viewings. The theatrical cut of the film showcased amazing performances, incredible visuals, and action set pieces that seemed like comic book panels come to life, in a good way. However, when it comes to its narrative structure and more technical aspects like editing, the film was seriously flawed. More plot holes than Age of Ultron, questionable character decisions, random editing that lacked cohesion and focus, and forced dramatic moments that lacked any impact because the attempts at character development ranged from limited to nonexistent, especially when it comes to Superman's character. I thought it was a 5/10 movie at best. As such, I was kind of skeptical about the idea of a 30 minute longer version. I say kind of because I know how Zack works. I remember Watchmen being vastly improved with its director's cut, so in a way I was expecting BvS to perform in a similar manner, but I also feared those 30 minutes wold be just there to amplify action and discredit storytelling issues. Oh boy, I'm so glad I was proved wrong. The ultimate cut of the film was infuriating, but not because it was awful, but because it questions the sanity of WB executives and editors and makes you wonder what were they thinking during the editing process. What I got out of the Ultimate Edition was a thought-provoking deconstruction of two very iconic superheroes that gave spotlight to the struggles both of them face when they aren't fighting crime. What I got was an extremely well produced character study on both Batman and Superman in a cynical world, a world dangerously close to our own. We meet Batman as a ruthless, worn out hero that has seen the failure behind his ideals and witnessed some truly horrifying things in his life. Superman, on the other hand, is portrayed as a godlike figure that seeks to do good in the world, but finds himself emotionally conflicted once he realized that every good deed he does leaves behind a trail of destruction (most of it due to Luthor's antics). In my opinion, this is a hugely original approach, one that distances itself from the rest of the competition and delivers a dark, somber, yet relevant superhero movie that understands both characters and gives them real human struggles to deal with. I felt invested in both of them, and hoped that by the end of the film both could find a way to redeem themselves. Their character arcs were very well established during the first two acts of the movie, and by the time we get to the titular climactic battle the emotion behind the jaw-dropping action is intensified. Lex Luthor as a villain was also given more time to develop with this new edition. One of the main criticisms with the original version was the fact that his plan relied too much on conveniences, and the character's mannerisms and mad-scientist attitude was annoying, and that goes without saying his motivations were unclear. Not only do we spend more time understanding his hate for any godlike figure and thus his hatred for Superman, but the added scenes allowed us to witness his entire plan come to fruition. It sells the cold, manipulative, calculating attributes of his comic counterpart. The acting is spot on. Every actor owns his/her role, from Cavill's Superman, to Ben Affleck as Batman, Eisenberg as Luthor, and Gadot as Wonder Woman, whose scenes are brief, but are more than enough to sell the strong and ferocious warrior that she is. Cinematography is stunning, and miles above that of Man of Steel's. And the soundtrack by Zimmer and Junkie XL? Perfect, just perfect. When it comes to flaws, the film still has some of those. The Martha moment, while serving as a pivotal character moment for Batman, felt off in execution, and its understandable that many people got mad at it. If your main complaint about BvS the first time around was its bleak tone and subject matter, this film is still not for you. I understand most were expecting to see the heroes being the most iconic versions of themselves, clashing in an elongated battle and evoking the same feelings The Avengers gave audiences back in 2012. In that sense, the film will remain divisive, but at least I have the comfort of saying that, at the very least, the film is competently made."

"This film was amazing. Ben Affleck was easily the best part of this movie, he brought his a-game as Batman. The chemistry between Affleck & Irons was outstanding. Gal Gadot did a great job as Wonder Woman. The fight between Batman & Superman was awesome. The final fight with Doomsday was outstanding in every way possible. However, there is only one problem with this film and that's Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor. He was sadly missed cast in this role, but then again it's really the fault of Warner Bros. Studios. Overall, this film deliver on almost every level. I highly recommend that you watch the extended version of this film."

"I know I know. I saw it in theaters too, and felt like it could've been so much better. While the Batman element was good, the narrative felt fractured, and the third act was just one long stunt scene. Superman was relegated to a supporting character, and other characters didn't get a chance to shine. And then I chanced on the ultimate cut. Calling it 30 mins of \"extra\" footage is unfair to Zack Snyder because it's exactly these 30 mins that makes the movie a worthy one. What I can say about the theatrical cut is this - It had the blockbuster elements - music, visuals, stunts, CGI. But, it lacked the human elements. The first 20 mins of the movie had it, but not after that. The extended cut in comparison has a flow to the narrative. There are no disjointed scenes, everything flows smoothly, and there's connective tissue. Superman gets to spend some time with his father, and mother. Clark Kent does some investigative journalism. Superman helps the people after the blast. Lois Lane doesn't jump to conclusions, she gets to the bottom of the crime. Lex Luthor apparently had a coherent plan - everything is explained pretty well. Wonder Woman was already good, so there's no change there :) Also, the \"Martha\" scene seems better executed, because it is a few seconds longer, and there's time to breathe it in. So, here's my take on this movie - The theatrical cut was junk. Get the Bluray for ultimate edition, and you shall not be disappointed. I've seen it so many more times now, and it's the definitive cut. It is the movie we deserve. It's a unique take on Batman, and Superman. It's a gritty take on the superhero movie genre, and definitely the best DCEU movie, and the best DC movie since The Dark Knight.P.S. Yes it's dark. We're adults, and we should appreciate mature film making without intentionally silly moments. It attempts to be philosophical, and something deep instead of just trying to make you chuckle."

"This is one of the best superhero movies ever made. Zack Snyder is a magician behind the camera.The reason behind so many complaints is the fact that Warner Bros. marketed this movie as a fight between Batman and Superman. That's not what it is. It's a movie about the origins of the Justice League.The cinematography, the acting and the score are all second to none. This film is phenomenal.P.S: watch the 3 hour extended cut that Snyder intended you to see, not the 2 and a half hour movie that Warner Bros. decided would be better for theaters."

"I don't care what the critics say, this is a very well-done movie. I'll start my review by listing what I like about the movie.1.) Ben Affleck is the best batman to me and it is not close. He pulls off the role of an aging batman extremely well. Also, Zack Snyder's vision of batman is legit. I have always hated batman up until this adaptation of him. Instead of being a conflicted and idealistic batman, this batman is dark, gritty, and 100% a badass. His equipment is decked out with machine guns and he has no aversion to killing people. In fact, he probably kills about 50 criminal by the time this movie is over. The warehouse scene is the coolest batman scene in any movie.2.) The development of a grudge between batman and superman is pulled off flawlessly. It actually makes sense why batman dislikes superman. Then, when they do fight it is about the coolest thing you can expect to see from a superhero film. 3.) I disagree with a lot of people about Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor. In my opinion, he played his role to perfection. 4.) B v S sets up Wonder Woman and Justice League with Gal Gadot's cameo as Wonder Woman and short clips of Aquaman, the Flash, and Cyborg. B v S is one of my favorite superhero films and rewatching it never gets old."

"The theatrical cut of this film is garbage which is why I rated it eight stars instead of nine. The first time I watched this film I didn't like it (not straight out hate but didn't like). Character motivations didn't make any sense, Lex was annoying as s***, editing was sloppy, and it was overly dark and broody for an action superhero movie. A year + a half, five Marvel films, a ton of bad reviews and a Justice League later a thought popped into my head: \"what if I watched BVS again\". This time I didn't have trailers ruining the best moments, I only vaguely remembered the film, and I was conditioned to look at it negatively but something unexpected happened: I actually loved it. Superman was just a normal person that tried to make a difference cause he could that others imposed their own beliefs on. Lex Luthor was a genius that couldn't stand his powerlessness compared to Superman or more accurately a super being. As Alfred said \"The fever, the rage, the feeling of powerlessness that turns good men... cruel\" and you see the same thought process in Batman. Batman, just like Lex Luthor feels powerless in the midst of a god-being and just like Lex he attempts to destroy him so he can get his sense of power back but unlike Lex, Batman learns something. I what is one of the corniest lines of the movie Superman says, \"Martha\" when he knows he can't win against Batman in a late desperate attempt to save his mother. Not only does this name connect with Bruce Wayne but it also shows what really matters to a man of steel: it isn't power, it isn't fame or anything else, it is his Mother and on a broader scale it is people. Lex (who doesn't care about people at all) knows he doesn't have the power so he creates something from his blood and the remains of Zod: A Doomsday for Superman. Not only does this film have depth but it also doesn't always explain it to you which is rare in a blockbuster action superhero flick normally cater to semi-comic book fans and people that want to shove popcorn in their mouths. This film rewards you for really noticing the details while still having massive explosions. One of my favorites is how Lex has all of Batman's branded killed which is why he isn't afraid of the branding at the end or Grandma's Peach Tea as a way of scaring the s*** out of someone. Of course, this film isn't perfect and I do have personal dislikes. The Batman V Superman fight was slow and pretty boring especially after watching such an amazing fight in Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 2 (If you haven't watched the animated Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 1 and 2 you are sorely missing out on something fantastic). Also, the addition of Wonder Woman who pretty much steals a hacker thing, gives it back and then suits up and fights against a giant monster thing. Not to say I don't like Wonder Woman (She is one of my favorite Superheroes of all time who showed not only can woman kick a** but they also don't need to be ashamed of their sexuality or gender) but she wasn't really that helpful to the plot and just brought in to expand the universe which was well done through Lex's superhuman hunting files. Also, the post-apocalyptic scene that was just a dream could have been cut but nothing is perfect except movies like Citizen Kane which isn't a lot of fun to watch cause it is too perfect. So to summarize, the theatrical cut is bad, the ultimate cut is Amazing and the other cut is meh. Please give it a second chance because it deserves it and save a good director from losing grace because of something he didn't do."
"I really liked it, don't know what all the hate is about. I'm actually a Marvel fan from when I was 7 or so, but Superman and Batman together in 1 movie? Just great. And personally I like Ben Affleck even better than Christian Bale as Batman. So just watch and enjoy, I know I did!"

"That's right. We have been waiting for these two heroes to finally meet and fight against each other. This movie is so good in both plot and special effects.Henry Cavill and Ben Affleck have performed well in their acting stages. They are the best superhero actors and they have filmed their fighting scenes very well. The movie starts to show the conflict between the lives of the heroes and now they have blamed each other for it. This movie is amazing and sets up a good plot for Dawn Justice."

"Actually...I didn't know what to expect. When you see Wonder Woman, you know it will be off of Wonder Woman and off of a Wonder Woman story, but with Batman V Superman, I was like, \"hmmmm, so who is this about?\" It was pretty obvious that it would feature many characters, but I thought the introduction to Batman was amazing. Ben Affleck nailed the part, not only as Batman but also as Bruce Wayne. He is my Batman. Henry Cavill continued to be super as the Man of Steel. And he is my Super - Man. A dark story? Yes, without a doubt. Could it have had a few more jokes? Sure. But not all movies or stories need to have jokes when certain events are serious. I really hope people can see this review and take another look at the movie, because, I loved it. I really hope the ratings can go up, eventually. And P.S, this movie is the perfect set up to Justice League."

"I'll start by making it clear I have only ever seen the Ultimate Edition. I'm aware of what was cut out for the theatrical release, so I will concede up front that most of the criticisms about pacing, editing, and missing bits of plot at release were merited.With that caveat out of the way, I must reiterate that this was bar-none the boldest superhero movie I have ever seen. To me, it was arguably the best as well, though \"best\" shouldn't be taken to mean \"most enjoyable.\" That honor easily goes to \"Thor: Ragnarok.\" What makes BvS stand out among other films in the genre is that it takes two characters who have been done to death since the 1970s and brings them up to date. I recently tried to watch \"Superman: The Movie\" for the first time in a number of years, and while it was still good and Reeves will always be iconic, I just couldn't take it seriously. I'll put it this way: If the story in BvS was \"stupid\" in your view but Superman turning back time by spinning the earth backward on its axis didn't seem like one of the dumbest things you have ever seen -in any movie from any genre- to the extent that it outright ruins the movie for you, then your opinion about BvS isn't worth much. Nostalgic bias was always going to be a problem for this movie, and the way people reacted to and reviewed \"Man of Steel\" was telling in this regard.That brings me to Zack Snyder's take on Superman. You know, that guy whose status as the first extraterrestrial ever encountered by humanity was a total non-issue in the old movies. Apparently, Snyder has a similar view to my own in that his take on the Man of Steel makes his being an alien a core piece of his identity. He may look like any other (absurdly attractive) person, but he knows what he is, and that makes him perpetually uncertain of where he fits in this world. He is essentially good and really does care about people, but he struggles to truly empathize with the likes of us. To be human is to be frail, and that is not something he can easily relate to. This is the root of his conflict with Batman.Just as Clark struggles to genuinely relate to most people, Snyder's Batman either refuses to or otherwise just can't relate to Superman. He doesn't see him as anything but a threat regardless of Superman's clear good intentions. Remember, a small group of Kryptonians were able to bring humanity to the brink of extinction in less than a day, and Bruce Wayne is nothing if not a realist. He didn't know the guy from Kansas. He only knew the god from another world.While Batman's anger toward and fear of Superman are readily apparent from the start, Superman's inability to imagine things from Bruce Wayne's perspective only becomes truly apparent during their first real interaction. This reminded me of the animated version of the \"world's finest\" storyline, where Superman judges Batman harshly for using fear tactics and threats of violence (also, actual violence) to get the job done. Superman wasn't willing to consider what it would take for a human man to fight criminals and save innocents, or what that life would do to him over time. Just as Batman didn't see the guy from Kansas, Superman didn't see the man who lives his life trapped in one brutal, unthinkably traumatic moment (this was beautifully conveyed during the film's opening moments), and had spent his whole adult life bearing witness to humanity at its absolute worst.The conflict between these two characters is as old as human history. They want the same things, but they can't understand one another. So they fight. And what a fight it was.Watching a fight between, say, Captain America and Iron Man was, to me, more frustrating than anything because each understood the other's perspective perfectly. The fight between Batman and Superman in BvS was genuinely gut-wrenching, as intended, because they would have understood one another if either had tried. The whole sequence hilighted Batman's tactical prowess and ability to control a situation. Maybe the most badass thing about the fight was that it ended exactly where Batman planned. That brings me to the big elephant in the room named \"Martha.\"I can't recall exactly which YouTuber put it this way, but if you thought the \"save Martha\" exchange was about their mothers having the same name, you had your brain turned off. The brain-on people have explained this to death, but it bears repeating. This was the moment when Superman became humanized to Batman. He was about to die, and his only concern was for his adoptive human mother. He still believed that the man about to take his life would do the right thing. Even with the cowl on, there was no mistaking the look on Batman's face. It was the look of shame, guilt, and sudden uncertainty that says \"What am I doing?\" Turns out even the most brutal, angry version of Bruce Wayne is better than Tony Stark at knowing right from wrong. At knowing that he had gone too far.From there, the third act was a series of truly impressive (albeit mostly CGI) fight sequences, beginning with what I regard as the undisputed champion of Batman fights. Nothing in the Nolan movies (and especially nothing in the Burton movies) even came close. Go ahead, try to convince yourself that Batman and Bane taking turns punching one another in the face until Bane's mask broke was a good fight sequence. No, this was a fight straight out of \"Arkham Knight,\" and it was glorious. The battle against Doomsday really was one for the books. From the moment Wonder Woman arrived accompanied by the intense sounds of Tina Guo's electric cello to Superman's tragic, heroic death at the hands of Doomsday, I was glued to the screen. Sure, the mere presence of Doomsday spoiled the end to a degree, but watching the Man of Steel laboring to carry that kryptonite spear towards certain death was no less impactful. A brief word on Jesse Eisenberg's take on Lex Luthor. At least one other reviewer on this site already said it best when they pointed out that this was his origin story. If you consider his scheme objectively, he is actually one of the more formidable incarnations of the character. If we're lucky, we'll eventually get to see a Snyder Cut of \"Justice League\" and find out where this story was actually meant to go. For the record, Joss Whedon and Danny Elfman both should have said \"no\" to taking a dump on someone else's art."
"BATMAN V SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE brings a fantastic surprise to a smash-hit team-up with one of the worlds most beloved DC Comics' icons of all time. The movie delivers spectacular casting, and fantastic acting with different characters having their shine in each scenes.The story follows Clark Kent/Superman who becomes a threat, after the destruction in Metropolis in Man Of Steel.(2013). Batman/Bruce Wayne sees him as a threat and begins his war on Superman.The movie brings spectacular storytelling, it tells the complications of human against alien who are on the same side, and the first meeting of Batman and Superman. The story of Bruce Wayne, with his many years of The Caped Crusader, sends him on a spiral of \"out of control\", sheer anger, and builds tension to wanting to defeat the Man of Steel. Snyder has fantastically gave this storytelling an exciting nod to the comics.Lex Luthor, played by Jesse Einsberg, delivers a very interesting performance, but very differently by him showing is his \"origin\" before he becomes a bald foe to the Man of Steel. He shows that his love of \"god vs man\" terrorises mankind when he ultimately creates Doomsday, and Batman realises Superman's inner heroism.It packs so many great \"out of nowhere\" excitement, including a first-look of the fearful Wonder Woman a.k.a. Diana Prince, played by Gal Gadot, and a fresh-new glimpse of the superhero DC canon: The Justice League.WATCH THIS MOVIE! The critics are out of their mind. It's a fun-packed action adventure which still keeps the movie enjoyable until it's final minutes of the movie. It's a FANTASTIC MOVIE! BEN AFFLECK AS BATMAN... is Incredible!A 10/10 overall!"
"I want to go on record as saying that this is a truly thrilling cinematic experience in so many ways. If pressed, I guess I could acknowledge that there were a couple ... let's say \"clumsy\" moments. And in a film that runs to three hours, that hardly seems like a significant issue, certainly not enough to rate it with fewer than 9 stars.This film has everything. There is dramatic tension right from the start. There is a magnificent story arc that picks up quite seamlessly from 'Man of Steel' and propels the viewer not only into the life of Clark Kent/Superman but also of Bruce Wayne/Batman.The villain is no mere cartoon of a villain; he is truly thoroughly (and apparently irrevocably) diabolical. He is a psychopath, and you wish for his death over and over and over. You want Superman to reduce him to ash with the power of his eyes.I have read a number of viewers' reviews, and it seems that the people who disliked the film / gave it a low rating had rather unfair and unrealistic expectations of it. That is, their own prejudices about how the plot could/should unfold or what the character development could/should be, etc. ruined the film for them. And that is a shame.My thought is: I settle into my seat, wait for the lights to dim, and then I wait to be transported by the film. I accept it, lock, stock, and barrel.As another reviewer remarked, I love how the film begins from the point of view of Bruce Wayne as he is among people on the ground who have fallen victim to the attack of Zod and the other Kryptonians.Why would Bruce Wayne not like Superman? Why would the good people of Earth hurl insults at Superman and burn him in effigy (on the news)? Because the good people of Earth just got catapulted into a new reality in which there are not only extraterrestrial beings (surprise!) but they are also superman! And a group of them are hell-bent on destroying humankind and taking the planet for themselves.It is difficult to see Superman as separate from the whole Kryptonian Krew.It seems that many moviegoers forgot that Bruce Wayne is also human. Sure, he's a hero, but he is flawed.. Just like the rest of us. He is a vigilante, after all.He has let his vigilantism get the better of him. HE is actually the one working outside the boundaries of the law, not Superman. It is the clear head of Alfred that shows us that he has gone into a rather dark place, that he has not seen what is really going on (in Luthor's scheme), and so he chooses to embark on his own scheme scheme to take out the alien invader. He is (allegedly) thinking of the future: if he wipes out the all-powerful alien, then it can't turn on humankind in the future. At least, he convinces himself of that.A philosophical question is raised in the film: should Clark Kent have remained a simple man from Kansas and never have become the Superman? Should he just let people die and let calamities happen? The question is answered for us in the character of Diana Prince/Wonder Woman. She withdrew from mankind (her exact words) and just sat around watching. Watching while people died horrible deaths all around her. So, should Superman have done the same? Do these special beings, these 'metahumans', have some kind of moral imperative to intervene, or should they be allowed to be regular people, too? It seems that humans want it both ways.It seems that humans are saying: \"Don't be a superalien ... except when I and my friends and family are in trouble. Then come save us.\""

"Batman v Superman: Ultimate Edition: If your looking for a quick, cheap thrill then you might not enjoy this film at the time. This movies theatrical version was butchered by WB and in doing so reshaped the story leaving numerous plot holes. So the Ultimate Edition is the full story and the one worth seeing. Watch 'Man of Steel' before seeing this movie. There is much to claw through here, so much so that the audience might easily find themselves exhausted from the overall aggression of the film. However, a lot of the story does work. The action is good, and the emotion feels real most of the time.This film is about Superman trying to become Superman. Trying to help the world, save people, find a place in this world not as an outcast, and yet is looked at has a threat by many. Superman is not from this world, yet He is trying to be human, find a place in this world, be excepted by earths people, and come into his destiny.This film is also about Batman being Batman for 20 years and losing faith in humanity, and fearing Superman, what Superman can do with his powers. Great film, great plot, great visuals. ---Yidioo"
"I didn't see the film in the theaters and just bought the \"Extended Edition \" on Amazon. I never properly saw Man of Steel- i think I rented it and watched it when already exhausted and fell asleep. I saw the mediocre user reviews and horrible reviews from critics of this film.They really have it wrong. This is the very best either Batman or Superman. It has a different take, on things. Much darker then earlier films even darker then the Christopher Nolan Batman films.First of all Christopher Nolan is an Executive Producer. So how bad could it be? I loved Sucker Punch and Zack Snyder was involved with that. So how bad could this be? Hans Zimmer did the music, so how bad could it be?I remember watching the old Superman TV shows and reading the Superman and Batman comics as a little kid and loved them, but i wouldn't call myself a \"fan boy\" of comic universes, like so many younger people today. As an older adult I will admit my favorite TV show of all time was Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but watched it on DVD only after it had finished. I saw the second of the Dark Knight series in the theater, but the other two, I watched on DVD. They were great, but not my favorite films like so many people. i also loved the first couple Superman and Batman films in the older series. Regardless, i was not waiting with baited breath to see Man of Steel or this one.I'm more of a serious film fan, who can watch Stanley Kubrick films over and over and my favorite films in the last twenty years, are Eyes Wide Shut and Intersteller, both of which i've watched multiple times.So, with that said, take it from me, the critics have this film very wrong, just as critics hated 2001: A Space Odyssey when it first came out. This film will have lasting appreciation.Surprised how much I liked Ben Afleck's Batman. it was hard to get into Henry Cavil's scrawnier looking Superman, but it grew on me. Amy Adams was great as Lois Lane, The Gal Gadol Wonder Women was amazing. Lex Luther was terrific, like Nolan's Joker. Jeremy Irons was the best Alfred ever. Holly Hunter and Diane Lane was good too. The movie had bad reviews but made a billion dollars. Hopefully everyone buys the Ultimate Edition and it breaks sales records and the film is re-appreciated. I have no idea what scenes this Ultimate Edition added, but it is pretty perfect. Now I can't wait for Wonder Woman and the Justice League and as soon as I finish writing this am going to watch Man of Steal. I'm into it now!I can only surmise that the bad reviews stem from too much expectations of the rigid fan boy types and the radical changes in tone, we see in this film.Total masterpiece of cinema, but I have a few criticisms. There are a few hollow scenes of typical Idiot cops and authorities getting everything wrong in a cliché type way and it has a few filler scenes of that type and a few moments here and there that felt rushed and cheesy. Maybe not everything restored into the Ultimate Edition should have been. I wish there had been more Kevin Costner scenes."

"The whole entire Batman V Superman movie was great and yes even though it felt slow to the majority of the people who watched it but to me I enjoyed every part and every scene of Batman V Superman and when it got to the fight scenes both batman VS Superman and the Doomsday fight it brought so much drama, intensity, and epic performances. So with that being said I give this movie a good 10/10 because it really did go to my expectations and it brought a powerful performance and a powerful yet epic introduction to the upcoming Justice League."

"When I first wrote a review for this movie a year ago exclaiming my excitement for the film, I had been high off a fresh dose of live-action DC superheroes playing out the beloved comic book stories that I had grown up on. It was all playing out before my eyes and coming to life. After a few months had passed, I began to notice things about the movie that I disliked: little gaps in the story, things that didn't add up, etc. My original rating of a 10 / 10 dropped to an 8 /10. But today it has gone back up to a 10. The extended version of the film not only rectifies the gaps but also silences critics.Many claimed that the movie was too dark or that it just didn't make sense. To those people, I say: \"Pick up a comic book!\" Many of the critics of this particular film were part of the superhero bandwagon that formed when Marvel began its spree of Avengers-related films. In fact, its estimated that over 60% of people who go to see 'superhero' genre films have never picked up a comic book in their life. I would argue that similar numbers could figure to those which view the CW televised DC Universe shows. People complain that DC comics is just too dark but the fact is that these movies are based upon actual comics which are meant to be dark (ex: The Dark Knight Returns, Injustice, etc.). Its like complaining that Game of Thrones (the TV series) sucks because they kill off too many characters. Read the books! Its frustrating to see such a beautiful work of art like Batman V Superman criticized by those ignorant to its universe and its meaning. This movie is in fact a catalyst that opens numerous doorways and leaves true fans in awe of the possibilities for future movies. But regardless of whether or not people choose to educate themselves, this film's DVD/Blu-ray extended version puts the theater release to shame. All of the plot holes and gaps are filled in 30 minutes of extended footage scattered throughout the film. The movie ultimately becomes more complete and people will wish that the movie had shown the full 3 hours of footage in its theatrical debut. As a major DC comics fan, I will of course pick up on things that a comics fan would not, but someone who does not read comics would learn to appreciate this film in its entirety with the extended version. Get your hands on a copy today or find it on Netflix or the internet somewhere!"

"I ignored the bad reviews and watched anyways. This film had a lot to live up to after Civil War was released and I went into this film expecting the worst. It ended up to be the best Superhero film of 2016 to me. One complaint was that this film was more concerned about universe building than telling a great story than Civil War but for me it was the other way around; Civil War felt like a build up to something else and to be honest, I felt that way when I saw the other MCU films. Batman vs Superman however not only had a great story, but it also felt a lot more consistent than Civil War. This film was way more diverse with the cast than the MCU but unlike the MCU, I felt like this film doesn't go overboard with the SJW stuff like the MCU films or The Star Wars Sequel films do. The Visuals were AMAZING, The Score by Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL was AMAZING as well, The Tone is just right as I actually felt for the characters emotionally, The Cinematography kept my eyes glued to the screen, and the script felt really Intelligent and Complex and despite people calling the writing confusing, I was able to piece it together with no problem whatsoever. This film is similar to Empire Strikes back in terms of popularity so over time after the other movies are released, this movie would probably be more popular.This film was way better than I Expected and deserves another chance.

"Its shame to see what critics and marvel fans did to this movie and targeted Zack Snyder for it. I have seen this movie more than 25 times till date. And i enjoy this movie as much as i enjoyed the first time. The fans who have read DC comics, wouldn't be disappointed in this movie. Its dark movie, yes it is. Because the title shows the intense situation at hand. Two superheroes about to rip each other apart for whatever reasons that brought them to this stage. Yes it had to be dark and intense.Only marvel can be stupid enough to show an alien invasion where humans are loosing the battle and the super heroes are cracking jokes while battles as if they are playing ping pong. a person playing Call of Duty game is more serious while playing than the marvel heroes fighting aliens."

"Last week some news came out from somebody online who had claimed to have seen a finished version of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. If you were like me, you've been leery of checking it out because you weren't sure how much might actually be true. Now Zack Snyder has spoken out about the spoiler-filled post, although his response doesn't really clear anything up.In a word, to MTV, he called the post \"hilarious,which might imply that he's saying that it's mostly, if not entirely, untrue. That might be the case, but then again he could have just said it was untrue and he didn't say that. What he did say, however, is that he doesn't like spoilers. While this may seem odd for the director who's most recent trailer appeared to give away the entire movie, Snyder says that's not the case. Even if you've seen the trailer, you can rest easy, as there is much more we have not seen in then finished film. Says Snyder I have the benefit of seeing the movie. It's cool that think it's too much, and I appreciate people not wanting to know, but there's plenty that they don't know. There's a lot of movie that's not in the trailer. In the process of calling the Batman v Superman Reddit review hilarious, Snyder goes on to talk about how he hates it when spoilers come out. The director would much rather that fans see the movie mostly blind. While he understands that some fans may wish to find the answers before hand, he wants his movies to be mysteries going in. If you're, as an audience member, exploring these articles, looking for answers to questions that you have, maybe you're okay with knowing before you go. It's like an individual taste. But like I said, I want people to see the movie without knowing.Spoilers are a topic that mean different things to different people. While most try to avoid them to some degree, the need to solve the mystery is a nearly universal human experience. We have an inclination to want to know the truth, even while also wanting to be surprised. For most of us getting some information is good, but getting all the information is bad, of course, only getting the details that you want can be difficult."
"The theatrical is choppy, poorly edited, hard to follow, with some really good moments mixed in their. The extended is much more fluent and is much easier to follow, it does have a long runtime, which might make it seem a bit dragging on, but if you like long films done right, like Lord of the Rings, you will like this movie as long as you get into the characters and story. Speaking of which, the story starts out perfectly showing Bruce Wayne as a character, and it is very powerful. There are several moments in this movie that are powerful, emotional, and shocking. Characters. Batman is my favorite fictional character of all time, and believe me when I say, Ben Affleck as Batman was perfect, he had the charisma, the anger, and the look of being through some bad stuff Gal Gadot also does perfect as Wonder Woman, but if you want to really see how good she does, go watch the Wonder Woman movie. Henry Call as Superman. I really don't like it when people say Christopher Reeves is better. Don't get me wrong, Reeves does great, but can you imagine him as Superman in this movie? I wouldn't like it. It would be like Adam West playing Batman in The Dark Knight. Henry Cavill does great in this role, I can say everything about him as I said with Ben Affleck. Jesse Eisenberg as Luthor. I thought it was different in a good way. I've heard a criticism for him as being too much like Joker, but is that a bad thing? Joker is my favorite villain, so to see Superman have an enemy that crazy, but still hold the values Luthor needs to be Luthor, I think it is great. The thing I thought this movie was lacking in the first and second acts was humor, at least good humor. If there was more humor, I would've given this movie a ten because it would give a more relaxing feel to the parts that needed it. All in all though, this movie was awesome, it had powerful moments, it was badass, and just plain fun. It had a great story arc and does its job very well."

"*I will be talking about the Ultimate Edition of the film* This was one of the most anticipated CBM of all time. Ever since the arrival and subsequent success of Marvel's The Avengers people have wondered when will DC launch its own cinematic universe, one of the main reasons being the opportunity to finally see titans such as Batman and Superman share the screen together: the ultimate nerd dream. On 2016, the moment finally came for BvS to be released AND.. it performed poorly. Not only did critical reception left a lot to be desired, but fan reactions where surprisingly split after its cinematic debut. People either loved it and called Zack a genius, or hated it and called him a hack. Me, personally, I found myself with middle of the road feelings, for sure, but more leaning towards the negative side with subsequent viewings. The theatrical cut of the film showcased amazing performances, incredible visuals, and action set pieces that seemed like comic book panels come to life, in a good way. However, when it comes to its narrative structure and more technical aspects like editing, the film was seriously flawed. More plot holes than Age of Ultron, questionable character decisions, random editing that lacked cohesion and focus, and forced dramatic moments that lacked any impact because the attempts at character development ranged from limited to nonexistent, especially when it comes to Superman's character. I thought it was a 5/10 movie at best. As such, I was kind of skeptical about the idea of a 30 minute longer version. I say kind of because I know how Zack works. I remember Watchmen being vastly improved with its director's cut, so in a way I was expecting BvS to perform in a similar manner, but I also feared those 30 minutes wold be just there to amplify action and discredit storytelling issues. Oh boy, I'm so glad I was proved wrong. The ultimate cut of the film was infuriating, but not because it was awful, but because it questions the sanity of WB executives and editors and makes you wonder what were they thinking during the editing process. What I got out of the Ultimate Edition was a thought-provoking deconstruction of two very iconic superheroes that gave spotlight to the struggles both of them face when they aren't fighting crime. What I got was an extremely well produced character study on both Batman and Superman in a cynical world, a world dangerously close to our own. We meet Batman as a ruthless, worn out hero that has seen the failure behind his ideals and witnessed some truly horrifying things in his life. Superman, on the other hand, is portrayed as a godlike figure that seeks to do good in the world, but finds himself emotionally conflicted once he realized that every good deed he does leaves behind a trail of destruction (most of it due to Luthor's antics). In my opinion, this is a hugely original approach, one that distances itself from the rest of the competition and delivers a dark, somber, yet relevant superhero movie that understands both characters and gives them real human struggles to deal with. I felt invested in both of them, and hoped that by the end of the film both could find a way to redeem themselves. Their character arcs were very well established during the first two acts of the movie, and by the time we get to the titular climactic battle the emotion behind the jaw-dropping action is intensified. Lex Luthor as a villain was also given more time to develop with this new edition. One of the main criticisms with the original version was the fact that his plan relied too much on conveniences, and the character's mannerisms and mad-scientist attitude was annoying, and that goes without saying his motivations were unclear. Not only do we spend more time understanding his hate for any godlike figure and thus his hatred for Superman, but the added scenes allowed us to witness his entire plan come to fruition. It sells the cold, manipulative, calculating attributes of his comic counterpart. The acting is spot on. Every actor owns his/her role, from Cavill's Superman, to Ben Affleck as Batman, Eisenberg as Luthor, and Gadot as Wonder Woman, whose scenes are brief, but are more than enough to sell the strong and ferocious warrior that she is. Cinematography is stunning, and miles above that of Man of Steel's. And the soundtrack by Zimmer and Junkie XL? Perfect, just perfect. When it comes to flaws, the film still has some of those. The Martha moment, while serving as a pivotal character moment for Batman, felt off in execution, and its understandable that many people got mad at it. If your main complaint about BvS the first time around was its bleak tone and subject matter, this film is still not for you. I understand most were expecting to see the heroes being the most iconic versions of themselves, clashing in an elongated battle and evoking the same feelings The Avengers gave audiences back in 2012. In that sense, the film will remain divisive, but at least I have the comfort of saying that, at the very least, the film is competently made."

"This film was amazing. Ben Affleck was easily the best part of this movie, he brought his a-game as Batman. The chemistry between Affleck & Irons was outstanding. Gal Gadot did a great job as Wonder Woman. The fight between Batman & Superman was awesome. The final fight with Doomsday was outstanding in every way possible. However, there is only one problem with this film and that's Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor. He was sadly missed cast in this role, but then again it's really the fault of Warner Bros. Studios. Overall, this film deliver on almost every level. I highly recommend that you watch the extended version of this film."

"I know I know. I saw it in theaters too, and felt like it could've been so much better. While the Batman element was good, the narrative felt fractured, and the third act was just one long stunt scene. Superman was relegated to a supporting character, and other characters didn't get a chance to shine. And then I chanced on the ultimate cut. Calling it 30 mins of \"extra\" footage is unfair to Zack Snyder because it's exactly these 30 mins that makes the movie a worthy one. What I can say about the theatrical cut is this - It had the blockbuster elements - music, visuals, stunts, CGI. But, it lacked the human elements. The first 20 mins of the movie had it, but not after that. The extended cut in comparison has a flow to the narrative. There are no disjointed scenes, everything flows smoothly, and there's connective tissue. Superman gets to spend some time with his father, and mother. Clark Kent does some investigative journalism. Superman helps the people after the blast. Lois Lane doesn't jump to conclusions, she gets to the bottom of the crime. Lex Luthor apparently had a coherent plan - everything is explained pretty well. Wonder Woman was already good, so there's no change there :) Also, the \"Martha\" scene seems better executed, because it is a few seconds longer, and there's time to breathe it in. So, here's my take on this movie - The theatrical cut was junk. Get the Bluray for ultimate edition, and you shall not be disappointed. I've seen it so many more times now, and it's the definitive cut. It is the movie we deserve. It's a unique take on Batman, and Superman. It's a gritty take on the superhero movie genre, and definitely the best DCEU movie, and the best DC movie since The Dark Knight.P.S. Yes it's dark. We're adults, and we should appreciate mature film making without intentionally silly moments. It attempts to be philosophical, and something deep instead of just trying to make you chuckle."

"This is one of the best superhero movies ever made. Zack Snyder is a magician behind the camera.The reason behind so many complaints is the fact that Warner Bros. marketed this movie as a fight between Batman and Superman. That's not what it is. It's a movie about the origins of the Justice League.The cinematography, the acting and the score are all second to none. This film is phenomenal.P.S: watch the 3 hour extended cut that Snyder intended you to see, not the 2 and a half hour movie that Warner Bros. decided would be better for theaters."

"I don't care what the critics say, this is a very well-done movie. I'll start my review by listing what I like about the movie.1.) Ben Affleck is the best batman to me and it is not close. He pulls off the role of an aging batman extremely well. Also, Zack Snyder's vision of batman is legit. I have always hated batman up until this adaptation of him. Instead of being a conflicted and idealistic batman, this batman is dark, gritty, and 100% a badass. His equipment is decked out with machine guns and he has no aversion to killing people. In fact, he probably kills about 50 criminal by the time this movie is over. The warehouse scene is the coolest batman scene in any movie.2.) The development of a grudge between batman and superman is pulled off flawlessly. It actually makes sense why batman dislikes superman. Then, when they do fight it is about the coolest thing you can expect to see from a superhero film. 3.) I disagree with a lot of people about Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor. In my opinion, he played his role to perfection. 4.) B v S sets up Wonder Woman and Justice League with Gal Gadot's cameo as Wonder Woman and short clips of Aquaman, the Flash, and Cyborg. B v S is one of my favorite superhero films and rewatching it never gets old."

"The theatrical cut of this film is garbage which is why I rated it eight stars instead of nine. The first time I watched this film I didn't like it (not straight out hate but didn't like). Character motivations didn't make any sense, Lex was annoying as s***, editing was sloppy, and it was overly dark and broody for an action superhero movie. A year + a half, five Marvel films, a ton of bad reviews and a Justice League later a thought popped into my head: \"what if I watched BVS again\". This time I didn't have trailers ruining the best moments, I only vaguely remembered the film, and I was conditioned to look at it negatively but something unexpected happened: I actually loved it. Superman was just a normal person that tried to make a difference cause he could that others imposed their own beliefs on. Lex Luthor was a genius that couldn't stand his powerlessness compared to Superman or more accurately a super being. As Alfred said \"The fever, the rage, the feeling of powerlessness that turns good men... cruel\" and you see the same thought process in Batman. Batman, just like Lex Luthor feels powerless in the midst of a god-being and just like Lex he attempts to destroy him so he can get his sense of power back but unlike Lex, Batman learns something. I what is one of the corniest lines of the movie Superman says, \"Martha\" when he knows he can't win against Batman in a late desperate attempt to save his mother. Not only does this name connect with Bruce Wayne but it also shows what really matters to a man of steel: it isn't power, it isn't fame or anything else, it is his Mother and on a broader scale it is people. Lex (who doesn't care about people at all) knows he doesn't have the power so he creates something from his blood and the remains of Zod: A Doomsday for Superman. Not only does this film have depth but it also doesn't always explain it to you which is rare in a blockbuster action superhero flick normally cater to semi-comic book fans and people that want to shove popcorn in their mouths. This film rewards you for really noticing the details while still having massive explosions. One of my favorites is how Lex has all of Batman's branded killed which is why he isn't afraid of the branding at the end or Grandma's Peach Tea as a way of scaring the s*** out of someone. Of course, this film isn't perfect and I do have personal dislikes. The Batman V Superman fight was slow and pretty boring especially after watching such an amazing fight in Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 2 (If you haven't watched the animated Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 1 and 2 you are sorely missing out on something fantastic). Also, the addition of Wonder Woman who pretty much steals a hacker thing, gives it back and then suits up and fights against a giant monster thing. Not to say I don't like Wonder Woman (She is one of my favorite Superheroes of all time who showed not only can woman kick a** but they also don't need to be ashamed of their sexuality or gender) but she wasn't really that helpful to the plot and just brought in to expand the universe which was well done through Lex's superhuman hunting files. Also, the post-apocalyptic scene that was just a dream could have been cut but nothing is perfect except movies like Citizen Kane which isn't a lot of fun to watch cause it is too perfect. So to summarize, the theatrical cut is bad, the ultimate cut is Amazing and the other cut is meh. Please give it a second chance because it deserves it and save a good director from losing grace because of something he didn't do."
"I really liked it, don't know what all the hate is about. I'm actually a Marvel fan from when I was 7 or so, but Superman and Batman together in 1 movie? Just great. And personally I like Ben Affleck even better than Christian Bale as Batman. So just watch and enjoy, I know I did!"

"That's right. We have been waiting for these two heroes to finally meet and fight against each other. This movie is so good in both plot and special effects.Henry Cavill and Ben Affleck have performed well in their acting stages. They are the best superhero actors and they have filmed their fighting scenes very well. The movie starts to show the conflict between the lives of the heroes and now they have blamed each other for it. This movie is amazing and sets up a good plot for Dawn Justice."

"Actually...I didn't know what to expect. When you see Wonder Woman, you know it will be off of Wonder Woman and off of a Wonder Woman story, but with Batman V Superman, I was like, \"hmmmm, so who is this about?\" It was pretty obvious that it would feature many characters, but I thought the introduction to Batman was amazing. Ben Affleck nailed the part, not only as Batman but also as Bruce Wayne. He is my Batman. Henry Cavill continued to be super as the Man of Steel. And he is my Super - Man. A dark story? Yes, without a doubt. Could it have had a few more jokes? Sure. But not all movies or stories need to have jokes when certain events are serious. I really hope people can see this review and take another look at the movie, because, I loved it. I really hope the ratings can go up, eventually. And P.S, this movie is the perfect set up to Justice League."

"I'll start by making it clear I have only ever seen the Ultimate Edition. I'm aware of what was cut out for the theatrical release, so I will concede up front that most of the criticisms about pacing, editing, and missing bits of plot at release were merited.With that caveat out of the way, I must reiterate that this was bar-none the boldest superhero movie I have ever seen. To me, it was arguably the best as well, though \"best\" shouldn't be taken to mean \"most enjoyable.\" That honor easily goes to \"Thor: Ragnarok.\" What makes BvS stand out among other films in the genre is that it takes two characters who have been done to death since the 1970s and brings them up to date. I recently tried to watch \"Superman: The Movie\" for the first time in a number of years, and while it was still good and Reeves will always be iconic, I just couldn't take it seriously. I'll put it this way: If the story in BvS was \"stupid\" in your view but Superman turning back time by spinning the earth backward on its axis didn't seem like one of the dumbest things you have ever seen -in any movie from any genre- to the extent that it outright ruins the movie for you, then your opinion about BvS isn't worth much. Nostalgic bias was always going to be a problem for this movie, and the way people reacted to and reviewed \"Man of Steel\" was telling in this regard.That brings me to Zack Snyder's take on Superman. You know, that guy whose status as the first extraterrestrial ever encountered by humanity was a total non-issue in the old movies. Apparently, Snyder has a similar view to my own in that his take on the Man of Steel makes his being an alien a core piece of his identity. He may look like any other (absurdly attractive) person, but he knows what he is, and that makes him perpetually uncertain of where he fits in this world. He is essentially good and really does care about people, but he struggles to truly empathize with the likes of us. To be human is to be frail, and that is not something he can easily relate to. This is the root of his conflict with Batman.Just as Clark struggles to genuinely relate to most people, Snyder's Batman either refuses to or otherwise just can't relate to Superman. He doesn't see him as anything but a threat regardless of Superman's clear good intentions. Remember, a small group of Kryptonians were able to bring humanity to the brink of extinction in less than a day, and Bruce Wayne is nothing if not a realist. He didn't know the guy from Kansas. He only knew the god from another world.While Batman's anger toward and fear of Superman are readily apparent from the start, Superman's inability to imagine things from Bruce Wayne's perspective only becomes truly apparent during their first real interaction. This reminded me of the animated version of the \"world's finest\" storyline, where Superman judges Batman harshly for using fear tactics and threats of violence (also, actual violence) to get the job done. Superman wasn't willing to consider what it would take for a human man to fight criminals and save innocents, or what that life would do to him over time. Just as Batman didn't see the guy from Kansas, Superman didn't see the man who lives his life trapped in one brutal, unthinkably traumatic moment (this was beautifully conveyed during the film's opening moments), and had spent his whole adult life bearing witness to humanity at its absolute worst.The conflict between these two characters is as old as human history. They want the same things, but they can't understand one another. So they fight. And what a fight it was.Watching a fight between, say, Captain America and Iron Man was, to me, more frustrating than anything because each understood the other's perspective perfectly. The fight between Batman and Superman in BvS was genuinely gut-wrenching, as intended, because they would have understood one another if either had tried. The whole sequence hilighted Batman's tactical prowess and ability to control a situation. Maybe the most badass thing about the fight was that it ended exactly where Batman planned. That brings me to the big elephant in the room named \"Martha.\"I can't recall exactly which YouTuber put it this way, but if you thought the \"save Martha\" exchange was about their mothers having the same name, you had your brain turned off. The brain-on people have explained this to death, but it bears repeating. This was the moment when Superman became humanized to Batman. He was about to die, and his only concern was for his adoptive human mother. He still believed that the man about to take his life would do the right thing. Even with the cowl on, there was no mistaking the look on Batman's face. It was the look of shame, guilt, and sudden uncertainty that says \"What am I doing?\" Turns out even the most brutal, angry version of Bruce Wayne is better than Tony Stark at knowing right from wrong. At knowing that he had gone too far.From there, the third act was a series of truly impressive (albeit mostly CGI) fight sequences, beginning with what I regard as the undisputed champion of Batman fights. Nothing in the Nolan movies (and especially nothing in the Burton movies) even came close. Go ahead, try to convince yourself that Batman and Bane taking turns punching one another in the face until Bane's mask broke was a good fight sequence. No, this was a fight straight out of \"Arkham Knight,\" and it was glorious. The battle against Doomsday really was one for the books. From the moment Wonder Woman arrived accompanied by the intense sounds of Tina Guo's electric cello to Superman's tragic, heroic death at the hands of Doomsday, I was glued to the screen. Sure, the mere presence of Doomsday spoiled the end to a degree, but watching the Man of Steel laboring to carry that kryptonite spear towards certain death was no less impactful. A brief word on Jesse Eisenberg's take on Lex Luthor. At least one other reviewer on this site already said it best when they pointed out that this was his origin story. If you consider his scheme objectively, he is actually one of the more formidable incarnations of the character. If we're lucky, we'll eventually get to see a Snyder Cut of \"Justice League\" and find out where this story was actually meant to go. For the record, Joss Whedon and Danny Elfman both should have said \"no\" to taking a dump on someone else's art."
"BATMAN V SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE brings a fantastic surprise to a smash-hit team-up with one of the worlds most beloved DC Comics' icons of all time. The movie delivers spectacular casting, and fantastic acting with different characters having their shine in each scenes.The story follows Clark Kent/Superman who becomes a threat, after the destruction in Metropolis in Man Of Steel.(2013). Batman/Bruce Wayne sees him as a threat and begins his war on Superman.The movie brings spectacular storytelling, it tells the complications of human against alien who are on the same side, and the first meeting of Batman and Superman. The story of Bruce Wayne, with his many years of The Caped Crusader, sends him on a spiral of \"out of control\", sheer anger, and builds tension to wanting to defeat the Man of Steel. Snyder has fantastically gave this storytelling an exciting nod to the comics.Lex Luthor, played by Jesse Einsberg, delivers a very interesting performance, but very differently by him showing is his \"origin\" before he becomes a bald foe to the Man of Steel. He shows that his love of \"god vs man\" terrorises mankind when he ultimately creates Doomsday, and Batman realises Superman's inner heroism.It packs so many great \"out of nowhere\" excitement, including a first-look of the fearful Wonder Woman a.k.a. Diana Prince, played by Gal Gadot, and a fresh-new glimpse of the superhero DC canon: The Justice League.WATCH THIS MOVIE! The critics are out of their mind. It's a fun-packed action adventure which still keeps the movie enjoyable until it's final minutes of the movie. It's a FANTASTIC MOVIE! BEN AFFLECK AS BATMAN... is Incredible!A 10/10 overall!"
"I want to go on record as saying that this is a truly thrilling cinematic experience in so many ways. If pressed, I guess I could acknowledge that there were a couple ... let's say \"clumsy\" moments. And in a film that runs to three hours, that hardly seems like a significant issue, certainly not enough to rate it with fewer than 9 stars.This film has everything. There is dramatic tension right from the start. There is a magnificent story arc that picks up quite seamlessly from 'Man of Steel' and propels the viewer not only into the life of Clark Kent/Superman but also of Bruce Wayne/Batman.The villain is no mere cartoon of a villain; he is truly thoroughly (and apparently irrevocably) diabolical. He is a psychopath, and you wish for his death over and over and over. You want Superman to reduce him to ash with the power of his eyes.I have read a number of viewers' reviews, and it seems that the people who disliked the film / gave it a low rating had rather unfair and unrealistic expectations of it. That is, their own prejudices about how the plot could/should unfold or what the character development could/should be, etc. ruined the film for them. And that is a shame.My thought is: I settle into my seat, wait for the lights to dim, and then I wait to be transported by the film. I accept it, lock, stock, and barrel.As another reviewer remarked, I love how the film begins from the point of view of Bruce Wayne as he is among people on the ground who have fallen victim to the attack of Zod and the other Kryptonians.Why would Bruce Wayne not like Superman? Why would the good people of Earth hurl insults at Superman and burn him in effigy (on the news)? Because the good people of Earth just got catapulted into a new reality in which there are not only extraterrestrial beings (surprise!) but they are also superman! And a group of them are hell-bent on destroying humankind and taking the planet for themselves.It is difficult to see Superman as separate from the whole Kryptonian Krew.It seems that many moviegoers forgot that Bruce Wayne is also human. Sure, he's a hero, but he is flawed.. Just like the rest of us. He is a vigilante, after all.He has let his vigilantism get the better of him. HE is actually the one working outside the boundaries of the law, not Superman. It is the clear head of Alfred that shows us that he has gone into a rather dark place, that he has not seen what is really going on (in Luthor's scheme), and so he chooses to embark on his own scheme scheme to take out the alien invader. He is (allegedly) thinking of the future: if he wipes out the all-powerful alien, then it can't turn on humankind in the future. At least, he convinces himself of that.A philosophical question is raised in the film: should Clark Kent have remained a simple man from Kansas and never have become the Superman? Should he just let people die and let calamities happen? The question is answered for us in the character of Diana Prince/Wonder Woman. She withdrew from mankind (her exact words) and just sat around watching. Watching while people died horrible deaths all around her. So, should Superman have done the same? Do these special beings, these 'metahumans', have some kind of moral imperative to intervene, or should they be allowed to be regular people, too? It seems that humans want it both ways.It seems that humans are saying: \"Don't be a superalien ... except when I and my friends and family are in trouble. Then come save us.\""

"Batman v Superman: Ultimate Edition: If your looking for a quick, cheap thrill then you might not enjoy this film at the time. This movies theatrical version was butchered by WB and in doing so reshaped the story leaving numerous plot holes. So the Ultimate Edition is the full story and the one worth seeing. Watch 'Man of Steel' before seeing this movie. There is much to claw through here, so much so that the audience might easily find themselves exhausted from the overall aggression of the film. However, a lot of the story does work. The action is good, and the emotion feels real most of the time.This film is about Superman trying to become Superman. Trying to help the world, save people, find a place in this world not as an outcast, and yet is looked at has a threat by many. Superman is not from this world, yet He is trying to be human, find a place in this world, be excepted by earths people, and come into his destiny.This film is also about Batman being Batman for 20 years and losing faith in humanity, and fearing Superman, what Superman can do with his powers. Great film, great plot, great visuals. ---Yidioo"
"I didn't see the film in the theaters and just bought the \"Extended Edition \" on Amazon. I never properly saw Man of Steel- i think I rented it and watched it when already exhausted and fell asleep. I saw the mediocre user reviews and horrible reviews from critics of this film.They really have it wrong. This is the very best either Batman or Superman. It has a different take, on things. Much darker then earlier films even darker then the Christopher Nolan Batman films.First of all Christopher Nolan is an Executive Producer. So how bad could it be? I loved Sucker Punch and Zack Snyder was involved with that. So how bad could this be? Hans Zimmer did the music, so how bad could it be?I remember watching the old Superman TV shows and reading the Superman and Batman comics as a little kid and loved them, but i wouldn't call myself a \"fan boy\" of comic universes, like so many younger people today. As an older adult I will admit my favorite TV show of all time was Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but watched it on DVD only after it had finished. I saw the second of the Dark Knight series in the theater, but the other two, I watched on DVD. They were great, but not my favorite films like so many people. i also loved the first couple Superman and Batman films in the older series. Regardless, i was not waiting with baited breath to see Man of Steel or this one.I'm more of a serious film fan, who can watch Stanley Kubrick films over and over and my favorite films in the last twenty years, are Eyes Wide Shut and Intersteller, both of which i've watched multiple times.So, with that said, take it from me, the critics have this film very wrong, just as critics hated 2001: A Space Odyssey when it first came out. This film will have lasting appreciation.Surprised how much I liked Ben Afleck's Batman. it was hard to get into Henry Cavil's scrawnier looking Superman, but it grew on me. Amy Adams was great as Lois Lane, The Gal Gadol Wonder Women was amazing. Lex Luther was terrific, like Nolan's Joker. Jeremy Irons was the best Alfred ever. Holly Hunter and Diane Lane was good too. The movie had bad reviews but made a billion dollars. Hopefully everyone buys the Ultimate Edition and it breaks sales records and the film is re-appreciated. I have no idea what scenes this Ultimate Edition added, but it is pretty perfect. Now I can't wait for Wonder Woman and the Justice League and as soon as I finish writing this am going to watch Man of Steal. I'm into it now!I can only surmise that the bad reviews stem from too much expectations of the rigid fan boy types and the radical changes in tone, we see in this film.Total masterpiece of cinema, but I have a few criticisms. There are a few hollow scenes of typical Idiot cops and authorities getting everything wrong in a cliché type way and it has a few filler scenes of that type and a few moments here and there that felt rushed and cheesy. Maybe not everything restored into the Ultimate Edition should have been. I wish there had been more Kevin Costner scenes."

"The whole entire Batman V Superman movie was great and yes even though it felt slow to the majority of the people who watched it but to me I enjoyed every part and every scene of Batman V Superman and when it got to the fight scenes both batman VS Superman and the Doomsday fight it brought so much drama, intensity, and epic performances. So with that being said I give this movie a good 10/10 because it really did go to my expectations and it brought a powerful performance and a powerful yet epic introduction to the upcoming Justice League."

"Zack Snyder not only understands the characters but he also understands how to craft a real amazing movie for fans - honestly blew me away (extended cut) Brilliant!Don't believe what the internet is telling you to think - take this from a person who has worked in the comic book industry - this is amazing!"

"When I first wrote a review for this movie a year ago exclaiming my excitement for the film, I had been high off a fresh dose of live-action DC superheroes playing out the beloved comic book stories that I had grown up on. It was all playing out before my eyes and coming to life. After a few months had passed, I began to notice things about the movie that I disliked: little gaps in the story, things that didn't add up, etc. My original rating of a 10 / 10 dropped to an 8 /10. But today it has gone back up to a 10. The extended version of the film not only rectifies the gaps but also silences critics.Many claimed that the movie was too dark or that it just didn't make sense. To those people, I say: \"Pick up a comic book!\" Many of the critics of this particular film were part of the superhero bandwagon that formed when Marvel began its spree of Avengers-related films. In fact, its estimated that over 60% of people who go to see 'superhero' genre films have never picked up a comic book in their life. I would argue that similar numbers could figure to those which view the CW televised DC Universe shows. People complain that DC comics is just too dark but the fact is that these movies are based upon actual comics which are meant to be dark (ex: The Dark Knight Returns, Injustice, etc.). Its like complaining that Game of Thrones (the TV series) sucks because they kill off too many characters. Read the books! Its frustrating to see such a beautiful work of art like Batman V Superman criticized by those ignorant to its universe and its meaning. This movie is in fact a catalyst that opens numerous doorways and leaves true fans in awe of the possibilities for future movies. But regardless of whether or not people choose to educate themselves, this film's DVD/Blu-ray extended version puts the theater release to shame. All of the plot holes and gaps are filled in 30 minutes of extended footage scattered throughout the film. The movie ultimately becomes more complete and people will wish that the movie had shown the full 3 hours of footage in its theatrical debut. As a major DC comics fan, I will of course pick up on things that a comics fan would not, but someone who does not read comics would learn to appreciate this film in its entirety with the extended version. Get your hands on a copy today or find it on Netflix or the internet somewhere!"

"I ignored the bad reviews and watched anyways. This film had a lot to live up to after Civil War was released and I went into this film expecting the worst. It ended up to be the best Superhero film of 2016 to me. One complaint was that this film was more concerned about universe building than telling a great story than Civil War but for me it was the other way around; Civil War felt like a build up to something else and to be honest, I felt that way when I saw the other MCU films. Batman vs Superman however not only had a great story, but it also felt a lot more consistent than Civil War. This film was way more diverse with the cast than the MCU but unlike the MCU, I felt like this film doesn't go overboard with the SJW stuff like the MCU films or The Star Wars Sequel films do. The Visuals were AMAZING, The Score by Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL was AMAZING as well, The Tone is just right as I actually felt for the characters emotionally, The Cinematography kept my eyes glued to the screen, and the script felt really Intelligent and Complex and despite people calling the writing confusing, I was able to piece it together with no problem whatsoever. This film is similar to Empire Strikes back in terms of popularity so over time after the other movies are released, this movie would probably be more popular.This film was way better than I Expected and deserves another chance.
10/10"

"Its shame to see what critics and marvel fans did to this movie and targeted Zack Snyder for it. I have seen this movie more than 25 times till date. And i enjoy this movie as much as i enjoyed the first time. The fans who have read DC comics, wouldn't be disappointed in this movie. Its dark movie, yes it is. Because the title shows the intense situation at hand. Two superheroes about to rip each other apart for whatever reasons that brought them to this stage. Yes it had to be dark and intense.Only marvel can be stupid enough to show an alien invasion where humans are loosing the battle and the super heroes are cracking jokes while battles as if they are playing ping pong. a person playing Call of Duty game is more serious while playing than the marvel heroes fighting aliens."

"Last week some news came out from somebody online who had claimed to have seen a finished version of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. If you were like me, you've been leery of checking it out because you weren't sure how much might actually be true. Now Zack Snyder has spoken out about the spoiler-filled post, although his response doesn't really clear anything up.In a word, to MTV, he called the post \"hilarious,which might imply that he's saying that it's mostly, if not entirely, untrue. That might be the case, but then again he could have just said it was untrue and he didn't say that. What he did say, however, is that he doesn't like spoilers. While this may seem odd for the director who's most recent trailer appeared to give away the entire movie, Snyder says that's not the case. Even if you've seen the trailer, you can rest easy, as there is much more we have not seen in then finished film. Says Snyder I have the benefit of seeing the movie. It's cool that think it's too much, and I appreciate people not wanting to know, but there's plenty that they don't know. There's a lot of movie that's not in the trailer. In the process of calling the Batman v Superman Reddit review hilarious, Snyder goes on to talk about how he hates it when spoilers come out. The director would much rather that fans see the movie mostly blind. While he understands that some fans may wish to find the answers before hand, he wants his movies to be mysteries going in. If you're, as an audience member, exploring these articles, looking for answers to questions that you have, maybe you're okay with knowing before you go. It's like an individual taste. But like I said, I want people to see the movie without knowing.Spoilers are a topic that mean different things to different people. While most try to avoid them to some degree, the need to solve the mystery is a nearly universal human experience. We have an inclination to want to know the truth, even while also wanting to be surprised. For most of us getting some information is good, but getting all the information is bad, of course, only getting the details that you want can be difficult."
